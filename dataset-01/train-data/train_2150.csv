5,Christian themed movie,"Made in 1954, the film is 72 minutes long. Starring Redd Harper, Georgia Lee, Cindy Walker, Colleen Evans, Paul Powers, Robert Clark A classic movie!Rich oilman Les Manning has always learned to rely on power and money, but thi9s time money will not save him. Challenged by the Gospel and life's awful circumstances, Manning finds an alternate power source in God."
2,Only Good for a Few Months,"This pizza cutter worked great for a few months. After that, the plastic handle broke off. The center nut holding the wheel also became very rusty. Now I have a pizza cutter without the handle. Look for another pizza cutter. I can't recommend this one."
4,great cutter,"I've owned this pizza cutter for at least a couple of years, and am very happy with the way it cuts through pizza and foccacia bread. It is sturdy and easy to use. No wobbly cutter and the finger guard is good. It cleans well in the dishwasher. The nut in the middle has gone rusty, I just ignore it though. I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the rusty nut."
1,Center nut and bolt rusted,"The center nut and bolt on this pizza cutter was clearly not manufactured with stainless steel parts as it has completely rusted. Cuisinart referred me to Acme, their manufacturer. Acme instructed me to mail it in to them at my own expense and also include a $5 money order for their return shipping and handling! I explained to the woman at Acme that I could almost buy a new one for these costs, without having to waste my time packaging and shipping it. I won't waste my time pursuing this further - what AWFUL customer service."
2,Quality?,I've had this pizza cutter for a few months and the nut that holds the wheel on is already rusted. I would expect a little better quality on a Cuisinart item! It does cut well though!
1,not a good buy,Broke after the first use and could not get the screw to hold the cutting wheel on. Not worth the money at all.
1,Poor Quality - arrived broken,"Merchant would not replace broken pizza cutter. This arrived in a big enough box to keep it protected, so all I could conclude is that the merchant knew they were packaging a broken wheel. Handle was broken off the wheel when it arrived."
4,Johnnie the Great,Great blues-boogie piano- w/ Clapton and Keith Richards- even a rare Richards SOLO! Johnnie in fine laid-back form. Tanqueray is outstanding!
3,Practical clock,"Clock is very practical, nice looking design. Expected the clock to be made sturdier. Very nice size for small spaces. I am happy with it overall."
3,pretty...but fragile,"I ordered this clock, and when it arrived it had a crack in it. They were quick in replacing it, but about 3 months later I bumped the table and the clock is now shattered in many pieces. This is not a clock that is built to last."
3,A Mixed Bag,"A dependable desk clock with an arresting Art Deco design. My only complaints are that its ticking is a bit intrusive and the very plasticky face and controls should be improved. Nevertheless, a very good value."
5,Love this clock!,"This clock was ordered to stand in front and to the side of our large TV screen. My husband wanted a clock in front of him to tell the time, and I wanted something to go with our brand new TV screen. It blends in great and is a perfect little addition. It keeps great time and the face is easy to see and read. I would highly recommend this clock."
4,A fascinating insider's view from the Clinton White House,"This is a carefully researched account by two former Clinton aides. It fairly convincingly makes the argument that quarreling amongst the various Clinton administration agencies involved in assessing the dangers of the growing al Qaeda prevented much being done about it. The major players seem to have been the Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and the State Department, each protecting its own turf and thus blocking cooperation that might have led to effective measures being activated.The book is superb at outlining the rise of Bin Laden and radical Islam. It also explains why Clinton wasn't able to use the bully pulpit to warn against what he'd been told was happening in that quarter, namely that the punditocracy were already charging him with diverting attention from his own problems by talking about external dangers to national security."
5,"Finally, some truly in-depth big-picture analysis","By far the most substantive explanation of the who, what, when, where and why of the Al-Queda threat and the West's response. I don't get smearing this as a Clinton apologia -- you'd have to really hate Clinton to see it that way. Way more than half the book has nothing at all to do with the Clinton White House. I thought the ""Fields of Jihad"" chapter was great -- the analysis of threats, country by country -- the Indonesia section looks eerily prescient after the Bali bombing. Read this to get deep into this subject."
3,Good but ...,"The book is easy to read and clearly explain the historical progress of radical Islam.My only problem is the authors are not quoting primary resources of radical Muslim thinkers but quoting others who wrote about these thinkers.In page 46 Ali is described as Muhammad's son-in-law and nephew. That is a huge mistake as Muhammad have no brothers or sisters and Ali is his cousin.Such mistake which is repeated in the reprint of the book in the paperback edition make me think, what else is not accurate in the book?"
3,Interesting conclusions,"I read this book quite carefully trying to detect any bias from the authors. It seemed as if this book gave more credit to Clinton then he deserved. While I don't have the insights into what was going on in Washington and Clinton's mind at the time of his presidency I find it hard to believe that he was focused as clearly on terrorism as the authors claim. It appears from other works that I have read that he was much more focused on saving his presidency and creating his legacy.That said, the first half of this book was very enlightening on the mind set of modern islamic terrorism.I recommend this book to anyone wanting to increase their understanding. You should also read ""Bin Laden, the man who declared war on America""."
4,"solid facts, no specific ideas","The book offers a good, even if partisan, account of the American anti-terrorist activity. However, it leaves a different impression from what the authors probably attempted to achieve. Instead of appreciating the heroic struggle of American government with terrorism, the reader sees a patent account of bureaucratic stupidity, bizarre inefficiency and cheap ambitions governing the national defense policy. The book is a practical invitation to terrorists to act as they wish, a statement of inability to cope with a dynamic threat, virtually guaranteeing the impunity for perpetrators."
2,The Age of Sacred Terror,"Unfortunately the book spends too much time making excuses for Bill Clinton's failure to bring down Bin Laden and too little time focusing what really went wrong in the Clinton Whitehouse. Claims Clinton was obsessed with Bin Laden but fails to mention or explain why Clinton never met with the head of the CIA during his entire Presidency. Cites the Military's and FBI's hatred of Clinton as a big reason for Clinton's failure. If you are looking for a Clinton apology piece, you will like this book. If you are looking for real answers, look elsewhere."
3,"Not bad, But there are better options.",The problem with ASA is that it skips lots of steps in the harder transport aircraft performance questions so you don't really get the full feel of how to work through the problem on your own.
2,Step up to SoundStation,"I bought this phone hoping it would be similar in quality to the polycom soundstation phones we use at work. It was not.When I use the phone, I often cannot hear the first half sentence of the other party when they begin speaking. They complain that I sound like I am in a huge room, and can't hear me if I get more than a foot from the unit.I am most disappointed."
2,No different than mainstream cheap phones,This phone was WAY under my expectations based on my experience with the SoundStation at work. This phone was as bad as the junker i've had in my closet for years that cost no more than $30 at WalMart.My main complaints:* I was frequently told that I sounded like I was in a tunnel.* The initial part of what I said when I spoke was clipped.* And the phone would chirp every few minutes for no apparent reason.Do not waste your money on this phone.
3,"Good conference phone, but ...","I got this conference phone at a good price. It is quite expensive for home use.Pro:* It can be loud.* When someone in the house pick up the phone, it makes a short beep. Great for monitoring.* Cord is long. Great when you want to extend to other table.* Got a RCA jack if you want to record it.Con:* It does sound like you are inside a big tunnel. Isnt all speakphone like this? Who can tell the difference if both are using it.* Too expensive."
1,Item did not work,Item did not work. I have returned it. The unit did not power on and we really needed it for a meeting.
1,Polycom voiceStation 100 Converence Phone,"The machine is adequate. People on the other side of the call tell me it still sounds like I am in a tunnel. When I received machine I mailed in the warranty card which was returned to me noting that the address on the warranty card was no longer active. That told me I must have an old model. I attempted to reach Polycom cusomer service on several occassions merely to get an address to send the warranty card, but their phone system made me go through 8 voice mail screens and still, no live person. I gave up and threw the machine away."
2,Why release this as SACD?,"The performances are nice, but the quality of the recording is awful. There's noise (and I don't mean studio noise) in the background, the piano sounds like it's wrapped in a blanket, and the violin sounds far away and muddy. And it's not multichannel. Even a moderately well done CD would put this disc to shame. Waste of SACD technology and my money."
4,Graceful,"Pianist Mitsuko Uchida has wonderful touch, as always, and violinist Mark Steinberg displays quite a graceful touch of his own as they romp through this delightful music. Like many classical music fans, I sometimes get caught up in orchestral music to the point that when I do hear a recording like this one, I suddenly remember what a delight chamber music can be. Highly recommended, although I prefer the performances of Hahn and Zhu."
5,Gorgeous!,"I so love this cd. I'm an artist (painter) [...]i play this in my studio and it is for a while now, my favorite Mozart cd. I'm a big fan of Mozart, particularly the operas.just awesome.gorgeous, slow, clever and gentle.A while ago I started researching Mozart music, and ended up downloading nearly everything that exists. This is probably my favorite. I also like a cd of piano sonatas. When I want a gigantic sound, I go for ""Le Nozze di Figaro"". That opera rocks my world.But this cd is the most beautiful instrumentally."
4,Formation,"This is one of the primary text for Faith Formations. This is my first experience reading Wilhoit, and he is easy and informative to easy."
5,Nurture That Is Christian,A super book that adds to my fledgling library of seminary and future profesional volumes. Many great insights and ideas.
3,Directors Chair,"Quality was what I expected for the price. The hole for attaching the foot rest had to moved over to allow foot rest to fit. Chair was only the frame, I expected also the canvas seat and back, had to order separate."
1,Cheap Chairs,"I bought one of these chairs for our computer area, because I like the looks of it and it could be easily folded for space. We had the chair one day and the wood frame broke. JUNK. My daughter who is smaller than average sat in it and the frame snapped. These are a cheap version of a directors chair."
5,Can never go wrong with Pelican,"Fit my AR 15 16"" just fine, with room for my second DPMS 24"" barrel and STILL has room for another barrel and 4 or 5 mags."
5,Used them in the military...,"Very attractive. Can accomodate two weapons easily, plus ammo and mags. Few cases like this have wheels for easy transport.Additionally the waterproof and air tight feature are a plus, unlike others advertized."
5,Barrett 50 caliber,I have 9 of these cases I use them for M 16's to my Barrett 50 Cal a person 300 Winchester Magnum that's been modified and it carried them in these cases for years.
5,Seriously engineered case,"Wow, more than I expected and worth the $$$. Tough as can be, heavy (and protected) hinge pins, double throw latches and tight o-ring seal. If a case can have pride of ownership and perfect function, this is it. The solid foam, (recommended) cut so perfectly with an electric fillet knife that it looks laser cut. It was so easy to trace an outline and cut. Only downside comment is that it is heavy and large, but two handles and ball-bearing rollers make it work. After all, I suppose heavy and bulky is a good thing when it comes to airline storage, they can't toss it as far as the lighter brands. My cherished 1978 Remington 742 is as safe as it can possibly be."
5,Great case,"This is an all-around great case. Features include:- very sturdy- 4 lock points, 2 towards ends of case- rolling wheels- 3 separate 1.5in foam pads- air seal to extract air- lifetime warranty- 2 handles, side and end- room for 2 scoped guns"
4,Great Case! With a couple of issues.,"Overall a great case and consistent with Pelican products. It looks like it can survive through the worst.However, it is very heavy. With two rifles, the wheels help a great deal and perform very well.Although well described, the foam is not pull and pluck and needs to be cut out for a snug fit. Unless you have the right knife, it may not be that easy to cut out a section for your rifles. Since I plan to switch rifles from time to time, the foam is not that useful and I resorted to using smaller pieces to pack around the rifles.I would still recommend this since it's one of the best ways to protect your rifles while traveling. But not all that great to lug to the range."
4,image,The image of the case I ordered shows A top layer of foam being interlocking convoluted and the bottom being pluck out foam.the case I received had neither.
1,Skip this book,"What makes Tuscany so dazzling to so many? Its art, terrain, art, history, art, cuisine, art, people? Yep, all of the above. But you'll learn next to nothing about any of them by reading this book. It's little more than the author's love letter - he does love Tuscany - written with a grammar school vocabulary and expository style. I finished reading it solely because it turned out to be the only book I had on a long flight.You want literary tributes to Tuscany, read the real thing: Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Lord Byron, E. M. Forster, Henry James, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mark Twain, and Edith Wharton."
2,Very little Tuscany,"I found that most of the book was about the churches, gardens, and museums of Florence. The book moved slowly and I would not recommend reading this book. You could find this knowledge in any guide book."
3,It's decent for the amount that Amazon is asking for it.,"It's slim and fits easily in your front pocket. It seems fairly well made overall, but the actual money clip portion fell out of the one that was sent to me when I tried to slip some dollars into it. I had to apply some adhesive and put it back in and fold the leather back into it, but it's been fine since I did that. I just wish I didn't have to do that in the first place."
5,More Melodic Than Most,"For Corvus Corax, this album is very melody-driven. It's much more 'musical' than their usual heavily rhythmic, almost tribal, sound.Yet another great album from this fine, talented and unusual group!"
4,Holiday Affair,They were great getting it to me in time for the holidays.This cd is great for anybody into the soap operas. It had alot of great songs on there. Although it is not the best christmans album purchased.I am still glad I bought it.
5,Love this Album,"I love hearing all of my favorite soap actors sing. It;s nice to hear christmas music. I love to hear Jason Thompson's winter wonderland, his voice is so sexy."
5,Talent,Wow! What a surprise! I really enjoyed the musical side of these actors/actresses. Who knew they had such wonderful voices?!?
1,Lost ?,I have not yet received this book. Can you check to see when it was sent to me. I have not received the Monks of Qubilai Khan though I did receive Clavijo's account of Amir Timur. I would appreciate an early investigation of this matter.Many thanksGeorge Lane
2,Too costly and cumbersome,It is very cumbersome and not flexible. The large does not fit someone who is a 42 inch chest well at all. I think it is much too costly for what you get.
2,Not what expected,"Looking at the picture it looks very light, this ornament is honestly very dull. It doesn't match well with the other suggested objects either."
5,Wife loves it!,Great starter kit that has all the little things you'll need to keep your projects going.
2,Item Great Deal,"I am new to the Cricut world and when shopping for items found they were a little high price. Reviewed Amazon and found this bundle and it is a good deal! Once I got the item, found out that the cutting mats were for the Cricut and not for the Cricut Essential machine. Contacted the company and they would not swap the 6X12 for the 12X12 mats without me spending lots more money. I think they could of swapped with me and I pay the postage but there was no negotiating."
2,not for classroom use,"This product may work for scrap booking- but I couldn't use it for my classroom- I needed letters smaller than 1"". And there are no cartridges for block or elementary alphabet letters."
5,valuable asset for the cricut,The kit completes the Cricut. There is no need to to search for a way to enjoy using the Cricut by searching for the tools to complete a project.
4,Nice tools for the Cricut,"I like this product, but the 6 x 12 mat was not something for the use of my expression machine. The tools have come in handy though, with all the very intircate designs that have to be removed from the cutting mat."
3,Falls a little bit short,"Product was good except that the cutting matt that was provided only fit the Cricut's small machine 6"" x 12"" which was useless for the Cricut Essentials we purchased."
4,Cricut,"While this cricut is somewhat limited, it was inexpensive and serves my purpose very well. It's for personal use and I don't need anything that can print huge lettering, etc."
5,Cricut Tool Kit,Having the tools all together in a kit is a great idea and a wonderful gift. The zipper case is a special feature for keeping everything organized.
3,Be smart,"This is a good product however be smart with your money! You can purchase this exact item at Joann's or Michael's for roughly around $70-80. I thought I wanted this set because I thought the cutting mat and paper were bigger, but I went to Joann's and saw that they were very small! That changed my mind immediately, especially for the price."
4,Really great useful Cricut tools kit!,I was happy to have a kit rather then individual products. It's a very nice introduction into the Cricut world. I really liked the paper designs. Only peeve was not being able to choose mat size. I don't have the small Cricut. So the mat is off to someone who does. However the price I paid was so much less then if I were to purchase all products separately.
2,"If you like being depressed, this book's for you","Although I realize this book was ""based"" on fact, I believe that is the key word. The author took few liberties to make this book an enjoyable read. Instead I found the main character very annoying and flighty, and this didn't improve as she got older. I know much of history IS depressing, and life was hard. However, I wish I'd skipped this novel and just turned on the local news."
3,You'll Never Be the Same!,"Today, I can truly say with complete belief - not a trace of doubt: ""The Lord, He is my shepherd"". Many years of bible study, church going, and surviving many trials of life, still left me without a deep, passionate, all-encompassing love for Him. Why? Because I couldn't grasp the reality of the depth of how much He loved me, and continues to love me every day. This beautifully illustrated book of ""word pictures"" from real life experiences of a shepherd, changed me. I'll never be the same, I'm happy to say! He has become my First Love, my everything! How amazing it is to walk in His freedom and peace and joy with enthusiam to share His love - not so much with my words -- but with my actions!A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23 (Anniversary Edition)"
5,psalm 23,Wonderful insight of how the natural shepherd takes care of his sheep and how God the Good Shepherd takes care of us.
5,Beautiful expose on the 23rd Psalm,Phillip Keller does an excellent job writing about the most recognized and memorized Psalm in the Bible. I also recommend Lessons from a Sheepdog by Keller.
3,Shepherd's Look at Psalm,"It wasn't what I thought it would be. The images that describe the Lord's care for us are not new and nothing is added through the text. I appreciate the attempt, however, of one who has been a shepherd."
2,abridged too far,"This is an abridged version of what is already a short book. I bought it on Amazon by mistakte thinking it was the original. The full version of the book is wonderful, and part of what makes it so are the author's descriptions of his own experiences. Those are largely missing in the abridged version."
5,I truly feel this has enriched my life,"I read this book overnight, and have found myself reading it over and over again. The lessons to be learned are those that are the hardest and the most profound, yet Keller points you toward the path in a way that reminds you why you are travelling on it.Anyone in Christian ministry or familiar with the 23rd Psalm would thoroughly enjoy this book."
5,A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23,"I ordered this book to replace the first 2 I bought and gave away to others. The writer was indeed a shepherd and his words are exactly the key to greater understanding of the ideal way to pray. Living in the open outdoors and the solitude of a shepherds world, he helps we town and city dwellers appreciate the meaning of a shepherds love and dedication to his responsibility of caring for his sheep. We are sheep to our master, the parallels of being under his care, as the sheep is under the shepherds care, are rich with life lessons and truths. I am indeed thankful for this well stated book that helps me appreciate more the richness of God's love and care for me and to be thankful for his all knowing watchful care as I live. The final reward will be my security of an eternal home because I trust and give him praise and honor for how he has blessed and guided my life."
5,White Mountain,"This book ""found me"" 30 years ago and I am still an enthusiastic reader, giving several copies a year to friends who are struggling with issues and faith. I always believed in God but I didn't understand our relationship, it was always clear that He had the upper hand, but I had a lot of questions, why? why? why?, Now I understand what was missing in our relationship, I didn't love Him or trust in Him, to have my best intrests at heart. WOW! what a wake up call. Now that I understand that He is continually seeking and searching for me, is my provider in all things, I am in awe. So, when asked ""do you believe in God?"", my reply is yes, and I love him with all my heart! He restoreth my soul. Life is an amazing journey, faith, hope and love, but the greater is LOVE."
2,More clarity needed,"I was disappointed by this order. I have ordered the book A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23 before, but this time I got a copy that came in mint conditions; however, it was not the book that I wanted. This book just contained excerpts of what I actually wanted. I wish that there was a disclaimer somewhere that said that it was not the actual book ion its entirety. You can't see that small red line when ordering this book. Make sure you pay for the actual book that you want use ISBN numbers and whatever you need to get the right book. Don't just assume anything."
5,Excellent! I want this on kindle fire!!!,"From what I've read so far this is an excellent commentary on Psalm 23 by Phillip Keller and please select the option to notify the Publisher that you would like to read this book on Kindle!Phillip Keller shares his knowledge, insights and experiences from being an actual sheepherder as well as his spiritual insight and knowledge on Psalm 23. It's excellent!"
5,A different approach,A different approach but one that should be expected. A great read for church leaders. I have passed this book on several times as gifts.
4,Amusing crime story,"This obviously is not Bogart's most famous or memorable film, but it is an entertaining film noir that holds your interest from start to finish. They don't make 'em like this no more. The plot involves Bogart as a D.A., whose star witness in bringing the head of a murder racket to justice dies before the trial. In a lengthy flashback, Bogart retraces the case from the beginning, looking for some bit of testimony that might help him nail the killer before he goes scot free. Bogart is good as his usual tough-guy self, and it's fun to watch the erie black-and-white cinematography. While it's nothing to write home about, it is a good cheap thriller, much better than many of the big-budget ones that have come out since then."
3,Phoning It In,"It does show just how lethal the mob could be against potential witnesses. However, the characters are all muscle and little brains. Audiences want the bad guy to be just a little more slippery and the hero craftier. The actors' dialogue and delivery is very cliche...like every cheap tv parody of gangsters."
2,A Huge Bogart Fan...couldn't watch the whole thing.,"The plot drags. Bogart is magnetic, but seems bored, and the film tries to milk his presence instead of working the plotline or magnifying the other characters.I actually turned it off, and I love to watch Bogart films.Don't bother, unless you have to watch them all."
4,Good crime thriller,"This is a decent thriller circa 1950 with Bogart in the role of DA for the jurisdiction. Well acted with a decent script it delivers. With language such as ""hit"" and ""contract"" now commonplace in the action/thriller genre it's a little odd to hear them used as if they were new term (and they were then).The story centers around the breaking of a crime syndicate whose work consists of murder for hire. Much of it is told in flashback with few flagging moments. This isn't Bogart's best, but you won't be disappointed. This is a water-down version of a real life event based in the mid-40's in NY City. Another film, Murder, Inc with Peter Falk is a grittier tale of the same incident.Look for Zero Mostel in a supporting role and for the work of Raoul Walsh who has several uncredited directing scenes."
3,Bogart's Last Film for Warner Bros.,"A hard-edged crime drama with an unusual flashback structure, ""The Enforcer"" (1951) proved to be Humphrey Bogart's final Warner Bros. release. Viewers expecting a Bogart vehicle will be surprised to discover an offbeat ensemble piece. Cinematographer Robert Burks captures the noir brutality while an uncredited Raoul Walsh lends extra punch to the sporadic action scenes. Memorable character vignettes from Ted de Corsia, Zero Mostel and (all too briefly) Everett Sloane. Second-tier Bogart, but certainly worth watching."
5,Elephant Pin,I ordered this Pin for my Mom as a Mother's Day gift because she likes elephants. She absolutely loved it! Everyone that saw it on Mother's Day said it was really beautiful. My Mother is very happy with it and I am sure she will treasure it.
1,review of 3850 drill,Sorry that this is not a review of this drill but a spot on Bosch's good name. I have a 3850 18 volt drill that has had low use in 2 years and both batteries are shot. I wrote to Bosch about this and they returned my message thanking me for my interest in Bosch tools. I do not think that was what I wanted to hear. This is the 3 rd Bosch battery drill I have owned and first that is NO GOOD! I have a 9.6 that the orginal batteries lasted about 10 years and it is now on second set that will out perform the 18 V by about 3 to one. I had a 7.2 V that outlasted the availabilty of new batteries. It was a great tool that got loads of use. I have several other Bosch tools but this piece of junk just might end my buying any more of these tools at all. Take hede when considering their tools.
2,this bites,"a real snoozer. the brief write up that accompanied this video when i ordered it didn't really match the story in the video. some decent atmosphere but if you are looking for a horror movie or an erotic thriller, this isn't it."
4,True Country Talent,"I saw this fella' perform at Terlingua, Texas at the chili cookoff. He music is outstanding. I am particularly impressed with his lyrics...words from the heart with real life experiences. He has that raspy Mellencamp sound I love."
1,No Kindle Book Yet,"We have received two notices that this title is available through Kindle, yet the message we get is that it is ""Not Currently Available."" We are interested in this and other titles by this author, but shouldn't the title be available before you advertise it?"
1,Slow and sweet.,"This could have been an great story of how a wild girl found her place in the world outside her harsh people, instead it is a sweet and slowmoving story where the dangerous creature becomes a sweet young girl that learnes to love and cries for her past sinns.If you want a story where the people constantly launch into lenghty tales of the countrys history and in the moments that should move the caracters to haste and fill their minds with terror, all you get is a sweet timeout where eveybody take more than a moment to console eachother and they take stock of themselfe and the horses before moving the injured to safety, this might be a book for those who want a romance that is lenghty and without any real tenshion."
5,Why does God allow suffering??,"I have been on a long search for answers to 'why do these bad things happen??'In this book he writes; ""If we believe God is powerfull, we are not convinced that he is kind because, if he CAN relieve our suffering, why doesn't he? The silence of God during tough times strengthens this foundational doubt that God is good.""I have read book after book during the past year none of which offered any peace. This book has opened my eyes to some truths and I feel the beginning of real peace."
2,Book Condition,"Book was in bad shape, cover was wrinkled and torn. Pages were yellow.Did'nt pay much but I am sure it would have been in better shape and at a lesser price at a yard sale."
4,Good Product,"Pros:Stylish DesignLightwieghtTintedDurableCons:A little uncomfortableSides not ventilated (per the model description)All-in-all, a good average product."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"I love this song! I used to have this song on tape, but of course, who listens to cassette tapes anymore? (Except the ones I have, have the songs I really love on them!) I found this on a CD, and I'm really happy to have it. Also means that's another tape I can get rid of. I love the lyrics to this song, and find myself loving the song. It was on a CD called ""The Last Dance"", which is all the songs that would maybe be played at the end of the night, at a disco or something. It's a really great song to slow dance with someone to - not that I ever have done! But it's just one of those songs, that you find yourself humming for a long time afterwards. A great song, even if you're not old enough to remember it! :)"
5,JP at his best...,"I live in Massachusetts about 4 hours from the Sound Factory, but I make it a point to go at least every other month, and every time Peters goes to Avalon in Boston. For those that can't make it out that much, this is the next best thing. No one can rock beats like Peters. His mixing capabilities are off the chain and all his own style. If your a Peters or Sound Factory fan, buy this and it has a bonus video. If you've been to a Factory party, you know the dancers rip it. I also suggest Live with Jonathan Peters and Revelation:the S&M Party."
1,"THIS IS WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!","Smores are supposed to be a rare treat, shared over a campfire at night. Add in creepy campfire stories, and you've got the makings of life-long memories. This item, however, plays upon those sensibilities in all the wrong ways: no campfire, no nature, no togetherness, NADA! Just pull it out, and you can have all of these things whenever (it tries to promise).This is just a pathetic consumer-society product - RESIST IT (and all other products like it) WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT!"
2,"Smore's for 1. For 2, if you time it right","This is highly overpriced, but I knew this when I got it. This was one of my wife's ""please, please, please"" gifts that she got last Christmas. It's basically a few dishes, a sterno holder, and a small ""lazy susan.""The single largest problem, other than the value, is the size of the ""toasting area."" Despite coming with 4 fondue forks, the center grill area is too small for any more than 1 person to toast his or her marshmallow. If two people try, it's inconsistent, and someone is bound to knock a hot, sticky marshmallow onto the metal plate/grill (above the sterno), making cleanup a little more cumbersome.Really, you're better off firing up your gas stove or electric burner and using fondue forks, metal skewers, or just plain old forks.On the bright side, who doesn't like an excuse to make Smore's?"
5,WONDERFUL!!!!,"WOW!!! This is the best gadget since the bread slicer! If you don't have a camp fire in your home, this is a perect substitute. However, the smores sometimes burn, but just get them off just when it tells you to and you will be A okay!"
4,Fun S'mores Maker,"I liked the smores maker. The only concern would be if you had more than 4 people wanting to make them at once. The ""hot"" area is small and they would have to take turns."
3,Too expensive.,"I got my S'mores maker today, it looks okay but I'm a bit disappointed. Basically, its nothing more than an assemble of 4 bowls, a rotating base plate, a square 'stove' and four forks. There is not any electronic hookup or complicated mechanical design. It does not come with any fuel supply - sterno gel. 30 bucks is too expensive."
1,No stars,"What a disappoinment! I bought this for my sister last Christmas, we tried it one night and never ever could get a marshmallow just right; it either wouldn't brown or caught on fire in an instant. I never returned it and could never find any satisfactory address to write to the company and voice my displeasure. I am getting ready to give it to charity and hope someone can figure it out."
2,Necessary fuel not included...or sold anywhere!,"Lo and behold this product needs a certain fuel packet in order to work, and it is not included. I looked everywhere and couldn't even find it for sale! How am I supposed to use it? Needless to say returned it for a full refund..."
2,You've gotta be kidding me...,"We got this as a Christmas present and I thought ""what a joke."" Not only does the Sterno company not recommend cooking open food (not in a container of some sort) over a sterno flame, but the ""appliance"" is lame. You can ""roast"" marshmellows over a hot plate, a BBQ grill...You don't need an appliance for it!"
3,You don't need ANY device to make s'mores.,"I just made s'mores tonight, not two hours before seeing this item advertised. Here is what you need to make s'mores: the ingredients, and a flame to toast the marshmallows. You absolutely do not need a special kit or device. It's a cute gift item, but if you are thinking ""practical"", save your money.Regardless of how you toast your marshmallows, please be careful as there is real fire involved; even the marshmallows themselves can catch fire (many people like them that way). No unsupervised children!"
4,"Hard to find Fuel, but..","Wow, what a great gift, but it took some detective work to find the fuel. We tried Target, Walmart, Oshmans, Academy Sports and finally I went to the Sterno web page and found a list of where they are sold. We finally found it right around the corner at our local Ace Hardware store. I would look for the fuel first before I bought this product."
5,Great if you have kids,"I purchased this for my brother's family. My sister-in-law absolutely loves it. Not only does she use this at home but she's taken this into my nieces' school and all the kids loved having s'mores in the classroom. I read someone gave this a low review because it was too hard to find the Sterno, I don't really understand this considering you can order that stuff online from amazon and I can get it from a local grocery store. I think this is a perfect thing if you have kids, it's some fun family quality time."
2,Its ok.. Not worth the money,"Ok. I must say that I stumbeled upon this review by accident. I own one of these but was not searching for it to review it. It is ok. I love s'mores and thought that would be fun. The kids love it. I only paid $4.99 @ Goodwill for mine(it was brand new never opened. Box still sealed) so when I just saw how much they were selling for on here, my mouth hit the floor! It is nice I guess, but you can get the same effect with a fork and a toaster or a sturno can and save $179.00. I have a fondue set and before we got this they would use the fondue forks over the sturno for the fondue and get the same effect. The little marshmallow toasting area is so small on these that you can really only toast one at a time even though it comes with 4 forks. It really is a cute idea for the smore enthusiast, and great for children but NO WAY in the world would I pay $179.00 as they are asking on Amazon."
5,More than a devotional...,"I just picked up this book again today. I LOVE being able to read a short excerpt from John Piper and really get something substantial out of it without having to invest tons of time. Even the Introduction to this book is captivating! I especially love Chapters 15 and 25, about reading. Very thought-provoking.The chapters are only 2-3 pages, but aren't short on meaning. These are MEATY chapters and you will definitely have something to chew on for the next day(s) to come. I intend to buy Godward Life Book 2 as well.See my other reviews for other devotional book recommendations!"
2,Ineffective as a Devotional,"John Piper tends to be a bit of a hit and miss author for me. This was one of the misses. While Piper does have many good things to say throughout the text, it's thoroughly incoherent. I understand that, being a devotional text, it's bound to be somewhat incoherent, but there was no flow whatsoever - no connection from one essay to the next.Compounding that, many of the essays dealt with topics that I didn't find to be particularly appropriate for a devotional book such as abortion. While I agree with his views on such subjects, I didn't find them to be good starting points for meditation.In the end, if you're looking for a devotional book, I wouldn't recommend this. If you're looking for a collection of essays to assess Piper's character and values, this might be more appropriate."
5,"Great spiritual food, fine for devotion too","Phenomenal book with some absolutely priceless readings. Inspiring and challenging, very good supplement for daily reading."
5,a daily dose of blessing,"this book is wonderful, giving the reader a quick read to nourish the soul and saturated with biblical wisdom. The follow up is now available, A Godward Life book 2."
5,CD of Bird Songs,"I'm just getting started listening to this, but it appears to be a well-done audio production for its purpose. For someone interested in what songs are done by what birds, I would recommend this CD set."
3,Lacking Many Species,"I like the way the CD flows by catagorizing calls into 'types' of songs. However, the 3 disc set is sorely missing many, many species especially warblers. Probably less than 12 warblers are represented, many sparrows left out too.It is helpful but if I had known what the set was lacking I would have looked at another guide."
5,excellent teaching method,I've listened to all 3 cds just once through and already I can identify 5 or 6 birds by their calls. I find myself listening whenever I'm outside to see if I can hear one of the birds in this guide. I highly recommend getting this if you are interested in learning bird calls. It is highly effective.
5,Helpful bird groupings,"My 6 year old and I are greatly enjoying the CDs and the booklet. The groupings of the birds are very helpful. For example, we can learn how to distinguish between the calls of the Red-tailed hawk and the Red-shouldered hawk! We are eagerly awaiting warmer weather and the presence of more birds."
4,Birding by Ear,"The cds are very good. The organization and presentation are the best I have heard thus far. I especially appreciate the acknowledgement that the pneumonics they use are their favorites and how they encourage everyone to form their own and not rely solely on those of others. Until using this collection I was very frustrated in that I could not relate to the ""tricks"" of others to identify calls or songs. I now know that I must create my own learning tools in order to go forward with bird call and song recognition."
5,Birding By Ear: Eastern and Central Noth America(Peterson Field Guides,ASIN:0618225900 Birding by Ear: Eastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides(R)I've always enjoyed watching and listening to our feathered friends however my identification was limited to visual. I'm a learner by repetition and this audio series makes that possible. I have a substantial commute to work and can listen as I ride. I'm not only being taught but it is very relaxing! This audio series is an excellent way to learn and remember bird songs. Looking forward to spring and putting what I've learned to use out in the field!
2,Not very good,First disk of the three did not work at all.Also discovered that even the good disks could not be copiedto my computer. Wanted to load them into my iPod to listen inthe woods. Could not do so.Should be noted in the description that a copy can't be made.Makes for very limited usage for me.I returned the set.Capt Tom
5,Repetition & field work are the key to this CD.,"When I first received this CD I was disappointed & overwhelmed. I thought, how could I possibly learn any of these bird calls (I'm 50 years old). It seemed like a monumental task. Well, I kept listening over and over (thinking the mnemonics were silly) and low and behold things started to click. I made a few forays into the field and was very excited when I heard bird calls and the mnemonics made sense. I still get excited when I'm able to identify a bird by song or call. I even find myself doing it on TV commercials. This CD isn't any good if you don't include field work with it. Practice, practice, practice and one day you will be out in the field and hear a bird and know exactly what you are looking for. This CD has made me a much better birder."
4,On the Road with Francis of Assisi,"A fascinating look into the life and wanderings of an interesting character in some of my personal favorite parts of Italy. Specialized reading for specialized interests. I have recently commissioned a painting representing one aspect of the life of Francis of Assisi, and this book added greatly to my own and the artist's understanding of the man."
4,Rarities Released,"I was tired of looking for hard to find Apathy songs with P2P software. Then they released this 2 disc set with most of his old, rare, b-sides, and guest featured songs. They're all remastered and sound good. Some were even redone like the 7L & Esoteric track, ""Public Execution"" now has Celph Titled on it and the production is cleaner. Apathy rips it with everything from punchlines to story telling. Definitly worth the buy."
5,an incredible musician and a better person,"I don't think I ever got the chance to tell you, but you made a truly great record. It's comforting to be able to pop in your CD when I need to and remember all the fun you always brought with you. One of my favortie memories of you is the Christmas that I got my first guitar and you taught me a few licks that I haven't forgotten to the day. Not that I can play much more now! You also showed me what it means to have your being and your life affected by music. Thats something I owe to you, and something of which I will always be grateful. We're all missing you so much. Love ya."
2,Original and outspoken courtroom drama.,"This is a very subversive courtroom drama, taking swipes not only at the McCarthy witchhunts, but at the way the conformity of the 1950s ironically quenched the founding spirit of America. The casting of Gary Cooper is crucial - the former Western hero is now sick, mad, guilty, dangerous, demonised by a bureaucratic military.As a courtroom drama this is more intelligent than most, cleverly using the cliches for non-traditional ends. Preminger would go on to make THE great courtroom drama a few years later with 'Anatomy of a Murder', which had the benefit of a more entertaining script; but this one boasts a very disturbing portrait of browbeaten patriotism from Gary Cooper, and a rare Hollywood appearance from my childhood heroine, Samantha Stevens, known to mortals as Elizabeth Montgomery."
3,The Court-Martial Of Billy Mitchell,I gave it three stars because I dislike letter-box format & it needs a companion booklet.The film is a must-have Gary Cooper fans and collectors.Ditto for the Man Of The West dvd...JC
1,Ladies and gentlemen: another disaster from Artisan!,"The back of the box says Full Screen Format! What? This is a CinemaScope picture? So I put it in my player just to check it out. And what do I see? Some kind of letterbox image (about 1:2) far from the correct aspect ratio, but better than full screen. Alas, it is not enhanced for anamorphic playback, and the colors are washed out and fuzzy! So is the focus, and there is some kind of ""net"" pattern so obvious and distracting most of the time, that I finally decide to rate this DVD as unwatchable! Sad, indeed! Yet another disaster from Artisan, one of many DVD distributors that you cannot rely on. Sure, they have given us some pretty nice transfers, but most are far below acceptable standards. When will these people learn that quality means happy consumers, and happy consumers means better sales?"
2,BUYER BEWARE! Outstanding film...Disastrous DVD transfer......,"BUYER BEWARE! This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and an outstanding story of someone who saw the future and confronted an intractable system stuck in the past. However the DVD transfer from Artisan entertainment is a disaster. The film looks as if it has been filtered through a pantyhose, forcing you to lower your screen resolution in order to watch the film, and even then the results are less than satisfactory. The performances of Gary Cooper, Ralph Bellamy and Rod Steiger are worth the price of admission, if only the DVD transfer could have been better."
3,The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell DVD Review,"An entertaining and well-made film with good acting especially Rod Steiger's performance. The ARTISAN DVD is below average; the 2.35:1 CinemaScope is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs, the color is just OK, the picture is not quite sharp, and there is some background noise."
5,outstanding product,"to me, Kensington is a name that project 'trust'. this was priced right and works great. good cord length."
3,Terrible switch button at first,"I bought this power strip to plug in my tv, receiver and cable so I can completely power them off when I'm done watching tv. But the power switch is a poorly designed button switch which takes several pushes before it will click in so my equipment is powering on and off with every push. It's very annoying and I wish I would have bought one with a toggle switch instead.Updated: After a while, the button does work properly."
3,easy to install. hard to use.,"This product is very easy to install, just tape some wires together and snap it together. The book teaches a lot of useful skills relating to electricity, mechanics, and magnitism. As a product, it doesn't work to my satisfaction. You have to be very close to the reciever to use the remote control and if you dont have the freshest batteries, it won't work. I have found better results using any TV remote control over the included one. If you really want to use a remote control light switch, then buy another product. If you want to entertain yourself for a few hours and learn a few things, then buy this."
2,Good idea...,"The idea is really nice- being able to turn on or off your light via remote. However, the batteries run out very frequently, and you must press down the remote button about 15 times to be able to switch the light. I agree with the other review that mentions television remote controls working better than the one provided. Although the buyer learns about electricity, I would not recommend it. By the end of the first day, I threw it away."
3,"So, this thing is STILL in print, huh?","ATTENTION: Canto Della Terra and The Prayer already appear on Andrea's SOGNO CD. The instrumental version of CDT also appears on the 4-track maxi CD single under the title Canto Della Terra (cat. no. 563 459-2). Only really recommended for die-hard Andrea Bocelli fans. It's all recycled material, anyway."
5,Equal to Alan Drury's Advise and Consent series,"I had just finished reading the Advise and Consent series by Alan Drury when my husband bought me this book. It kept me racing through the pages to see what was going to happen next. They gave some hints, but kept enough secrets to keep the suspense intense. I want them to write more! They proved that a clean novel can still be exciting and extremely relative to the current events in America."
1,"Terrible dialogue, ludicrous plot.",I was offended by this novel. Save your money and read Clancy instead
5,Good book,This was well written and exciting. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to see what happened. Very enjoyable.
3,Interesting!,"This has been the first book I have read by Marilyn Tucker Quayle and sister. At first I had a difficult time getting into the book. It was slow going. About three quarters of the way through it took of with no stopping. The similarities of people currently living and not was interesting. I almost thought I was reading about Foster's death. I am not sure I would read another written by this pair but, they sure did let it open for a continuation. Who knows."
4,I Was Pleasantly Surprised,"I was able to purchase this book at a bargain basement price, and had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised, as this was an exciting and thrilling book to read.These two sisters collaborated to write a very readable book about a political campaign for senator. Maybe I am jaded, but seeing the levels to which some of our politicians have stooped recently, I found the tactics and plot to be all too believable. OK, so maybe the international spy angle is a bit much. And maybe an incumbent Senator would not have 'friends' with capabilities such as Bob Grant's friends possessed. But, these things, as well as all the other angles, combined to make this book fun to read and rather captivating. Besides, Marilyn Quayle does have some experience with campaigns personally - maybe these things are not as far-fetched as I might think. . ."
3,"Not exactly uplifting, or even enthralling","3.4 starsOk, so it's a true story. The script is fair enough, direction too. The acting is uniformly decent, with Baldwin as usual stealing the show. The lead is likeable enough. So why didn't I enjoy this film?Good question. Probably because it's just a little too realistic, meaning there's a lack of redemption, or whatever it is that makes art art and life not so art. I just found it all too bleak, in a very bland sort of way. Yes, the suburbs are full of deception and disappointment and dismay and d-everything. But that doesn't mean I want to watch them played out on screen...unless something really special and revealing occurs. And here, it doesn't.Well done, but I'd recommend you watch American Beauty or Ordinary People or Kramer vs. Kramer or any of the many other superior suburban drams. Sadly, this one never gets there, despite good work all around."
3,A little slow..,"The movie was okay, a little bit slow paced for me but overall entertaining. Jill Hennessy can do no wrong in my eyes."
1,Very Disappointing,"Boring. I bought it because I was raised on Long Island, and someone said it was a good movie. Wasn't worth buying. Alec Baldwin was at his worst."
2,Typical American pornographic movie about misery,"Yup life without God and chastity brings this kind of existence, this movie makes a mockery of the Sacraments of the Church as if they don't mean anything, they only don't mean anything if you don't have any respect for them! This is a sad but true movie, even won awards, what a miserable Godless loveless culture produces this kind of movie"
5,The next wave of writers w/ a lot of local talent to the PNW,This book is amazing. I recently purchased it and was amazed to find some of the authors reading in my area from all of their works. Writers from Seattle are on the reading circuit and you can catch them.
3,Chillers,"Anthony Perkins Hosts 4 Episodes. 209 Minutes.1. The Day Of Reckoning2. Puzzle3. Slowly, Slowly In The Wind4. Curious SuicideRated 13, Adult Situations."
2,Nice Wrist-Rest on Crappy Backing,Length:: 1:38 MinsThis good quality wrist-rest is mounted on a very low quality pressure-board backing. Just get a plain wrist-rest and skip this dud.
2,Poor design,"This wrist rest has a split down the middle with a very hard wedge just below it. My wrist ends up on the hard wedge most of the time if I position it for use with a mouse. There seems to be no reason for this awkward and poorly functional design except to show off the word ""Kensington."" Also the foam eventually settles down and gives no support whatsoever. If it were designed without the split and wedge area, I would give it two more stars, but it's not. I won't buy another one now that the foam on this one has compressed."
5,Computer Wrist Rest,"Kensington Wrist Rest is a great product. The platform holds my keyboard and mouse. Previously had trouble with my keyboard sliding around. The platform keeps the keyboard in place, and the wrist rest holds my hands/wrists in proper position. Comfortable and no wrist problems. Good investment."
1,Much bigger than you imagine,"I have used a similar product at the office and wanted something like it for home. But this is sooo much bigger than I imagined. Just measured my keyboard (17"") and the Kensington platform (27.5""). It just takes up way tooo much space."
1,Don't waste your money,"Although I am respectful of the fact that the writer deserves the right to his opinion, he could have expressed his feelings about the book here as a comment. To charge $5.99 to read comments like (for those of you that live in New Jersey, a quadrant is...), is nothing but a rip off. I am sorry I trusted Amazon to as a provider of value on this one."
4,And the scholar spoke,"Christopher Bryan's modest, probing reflection on how to read Scripture was a fun read -- that sounds flippant, but I found his prose style entirely accessible and his witness welcome. The book doesn't go into a lot of depth; it's aimed at a general Christian reader. But his words lend assurance to those of us who search Scripture for truth and for a guide to our faith journey -- a journey that tries to navigate between the contortions of literal readings and the iconoclasm of liberal theology. He is especially cogent when he proposes how the Lambeth Conference should have approached searching for meaning in Scripture -- a love-inspired, serious approach other denominations grappling with issues of the day could learn from. I look forward to reading more of his work."
4,Defender's Study Bible KJV version,Use it regularly in my Bible study. A Study Bible which gives a lot of good notes from scientific perspective.
3,Cute and Safe Holiday Music,My favorite song is their version of Joy to the World. Never heard of the the Jackson 5 I mean Jump 5 until this past XMAS. Heard them on a Christian rock station and thought it was the Jonas Bros when they were like 10. Not bad holiday music for background sounds.
5,Very Pleased,Received book as instructed and in a timely manner. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
4,Another good book by Terri Blackstock.,"Another good book by Terri Blackstock. I enjoy her writing style, her characters and her plots. I've read the entire Sun Coast Series -- enjoyed them all."
4,I Like It,"After I started reading Presumption of Guilt I realized it was the last book in a series, but I didn't want to stop reading it because it was quite interesting. In the past I read a series out of order and reading the last book first spoiled the other books to a degree, so I was concerned it was the same with this series. I asked Terri Blackstock on her facebook page and she said the Sun Coast Chronicles all stand alone, but now I'm reading the second book and suggest it is best to read the books in order because finishing Presumption of Guilt first does jump the gun a little on minor details.Although the plot is rather far fetched and I prefer a more realistic story line crammed less full of drama, I gave it four stars nonetheless because it is a good novel. Blackstock is a talented author, apparently with a preference for the sensational, and her books offer wholesome moral and spiritual influences."
4,Excellent overview - good place to begin,"I appreciate his focus on the 12 Step process. He stays completely away from moralizing and shaming. The center of his book is the souce of all healing - the Creator - and our getting past our own guilt and shame through a step-by-step development of a relationship with God. No bones, no preaching, nothing but solid Grace. Lots of encouragement. Written from the heart of a recovering person. The only thing that could improve the book would be to have better proof reading. A bit much dependance on spell check. Otherwise - excellent book. Thank God for someone with the courage to heal and to share his healing and experience with those of us seeking the pathway to Final Freedom."
1,Rc nitro fuel,When the package came I notice a smell and when opening the box the container the fuel came in was leaking...
5,Dazzling blues album -- exceptional playing and writing!,"I first heard Shawn Pittman at a club in Chicago a week ago. I purchased this CD between sets at the performance and have had a hard time listening to anything else, since. What a surprisingly great CD! Pittman combines exceptional song writing with dazzling guitar work and soulful vocals to create a compilation of tunes that get stronger with each listen. Pittman's CD is far more restrained than his live performance -- where his incredible guitar-playing prowess is the highlight -- but he does a masterful job of changing paces and mixing song structures, which makes the CD so effective. From the opening title track, through the angst-filled, acoustic-blues finale (""I Try to Stay Dry"") -- Pittman takes you on a stylistic tour that is nothing short of a blues power house!"
4,"Shawn Pittman w/ Susan Tedesche &Double Trouble, Antone's","Shawn Pittman showed up at Antone's Anniversary Party with Susan Tedesche & Double Trouble.(June 99) I felt so lucky to be there. They were all just awesome, I've been looking to add Shawn's 2 CD's to my blues collection ever since. KOOL"
4,"Bold, Unique, and Self Expressional Electric Blues!","Shawn Pittman is awesome! He can really jam and this CD is excellent. I kept hearing him on AOL XM Electric Blues Radio and would click on the tab for more information on this artist and also try to purchase this CD numerous times, and it would say ""Sorry no information or CD available."" I stumbled across this CD in Borders Books, and I am so pleased to discover the incredible selections on Amazon that cannot be found anywhere else, I plan on getting Shawn's other CD's. This guy is the real deal, and does not conform to anyone else, just his own heart-felt energy and compassion to play some serious electric blues. Oh, by the way, he is from the Dallas area and I have managed to miss him playing here several times due to work, but I do plan on seeing him soon so I can match a grimace or facial expression to every guitar lick he plays!"
5,Best christmas coloring book ever!,"This coloring book has all the characters from the classic movie, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. I am going to keep it forever and just print out the pages for the little ones to color."
3,Take Away Some Pieces,"There are some good insights on this tape, but I find that a lot of it is repeated, cliche and unnecessary information."
4,Great tips on shoreline harvest,"Wisdom from a master at living off the shoreline harvest. Includes chapter on survival living off the beach. Info on red tides, exotic seafoods. Great if you are interested in this."
3,If you want a different take on Rush classics then this is 4 u,"This an interesting little cd we have here. Members of various Rush tribute bands formed this ""super group"" of cover artists. They seem to have picked Rush fan favorite tracks to cover and do a nice job replicating the originals. The highlights probably are Limelight and The Trees, these two selections seems to have a little extra kick to them. The vocalist for the group sounds like a cross beteween Geddy Lee and the lead singer from the band Queensryche and does a good job hitting all the signature Geddy vocal high spots. All in all not a bad cd if your a fan of Rush it's a good variation on songs you've heard the original versions of probably 100 times already."
1,Who in the name of God allowed this to happen?,"It's my fault of course but WHY is this atrocity in the actual RUSH section of the store? This is Karaoke music at best. When I bought this, I thought it might be various artists or some sort of interpretation of the songs but it's a mediocre bar band. I should have taken my 13 dollars and ate it. This was a bad idea. The only difference in the versions is that one band is untalented. The singer DOES NOT sound at all like Geoff Tate of Queensryche or Geddy but more like someone from a bad 80's metal band. This is shameful and an utter waste of money. I want an apology from whoever distributed this nonsense. Unless you are related to someone in ""Run for Cover(s)"" stay the hell away from this tomfoolery. Oh, and the production sucks. I apologize on behalf of Rush and anyone that accidentally purchased this."
2,Just OK,"After reading all these rave reviews on here I decided to get this book. It's out of print and I could only find copies ranging from $20-$40. I found a really clean 1st edition and payed $35 for it. I wish I hadn't. This is an extremely short read. 155 very tiny pages. I do not understand why everything thinks this novel is so tough. Stark's writing style is so dry it takes any excitement out of the action sequences. And the bit about Parker having strong hands is way too played out. Parker has strong hands, I get it. I won't even go into how many holes this plot had. The movie (I have not seen Point Blank, I am reffering to Payback) is actually better than the book. Unless you can find an extremely cheap copy, don't bother. You're not missing anything special."
1,"Useless, not even worth 10$",We have this phone for two month now. After one month we started to hear a lot of background noice. Today it went dead. Not worth the money.
1,VERY poor quality,"This phone is actually a piece of junk. Far worse than I had imagined a simple phone could be. The wire that plugs into your phone jack is not very long, but it is also attached to the phone so it is impossible to simply replace it with a longer cord.When trying to carefully open the battery box, which is very tight with an un-flexible opening, half of the portion of the clip closure snapped right off.The window for caller ID is the smallest I have ever seen on any phone. And the very worst of all is the ring which is the most horrible tinny sound!I bought it as a back up landline phone after the Sandy storm, as all other phones I have are cordless and require being plugged in to the electricity. So I kept this awful little phone and put it in the closet. I will take it out only if I need it in an emergency. Was't worth the cost of a return. Don't buy it!"
3,"16X Writing Speed, 8X without errors.","When I burn a DVD to back up my photos, I definately want to Verify the written data after the burn session. I can't seem to burn an error-free DVD+R with this burner unless I drop the write speed down to 8X. Even 12X causes errors. If I ignore the couple of errors and try to see what photos are on the DVD anyway, the programs stop responding and the DVD drive goes nuts.Why make a 16X burner if the only way to get an error-free disc is to force the 8X speed?"
5,INTL INDUCTIVE STUDY BIBLE,"I own this bible, and Kay Arthur's way of studying the bible is parallel to none. I have learned so much from using this bible in my studies.The color coding is the way."
5,Great Bible!,I have many bibles but i enjoy this one because it teaches the inductive method of bible study. I got it for a great price also which was nice.
2,"Good translation, bad construction","I am an M.Div. student who wanted to use the NASB because of its literal translation from the Greek and Hebrew. I love the translation but I do not care for the construction of the IISB by Harvest House. The book itself is too large to fit easily in my bag, the pages are very flimsy (even for Bible pages!), and the corners exhibited wear before I had even used the thing for a week. I can't find any covers to fit this massive book, and so it is just falling apart before my eyes. In addition, I do not agree with the commentary used in connection with this particular Bible; it is a bit too historically literal for my faith. I would recommend this translation, but not this particular production of it. The only reason it gets a star at all is due to the super margins, which leave tons of room for notes, personal commentary, and other writings one would care to enter."
5,The best of the best.,I loved this CD it has all of Rudy's greatest hits and if you are a true fan this would really make you happy. The condition of theCD was perfect and the timing of arrival was also good.
1,Second Rate 'Chili Peppers',They don't just sound like second rate Red Hot Chili Peppers...they even look like second rate Red Hot Chili Peppers.
5,More people should think about this stuff,"Great book to help pick out partners. I found 85% of the book to be enlightening and thought-provoking. The book was targeted for women with men as an afterthought but as a guy, I still enjoyed it. Learning the lessons in this book could save you from picking a partner that will only end in divorce."
5,Good,Great book to read. It will help me to avoid the wrong men for me and pick a good one this time.
5,Good Book,"This book offers logical insight into relationships, gives information about qualities that are necessary for healthy relationships and solid reasons as to why many relationship won't work."
5,Should be required reading for everyone!,"I am a marriage counselor, and teach couples how to have happy relationships. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to have a healthy, satisfying relationship. I sincerely hope that all high schools, as well as colleges, counselors and support groups will recommend it. Not only is it full of useful information, ideas, and exercises, but it is also easy to read. I teach a class based on this excellent book, and participants say, ""I wish I had known all this before."""
1,This woman has no credibility!,One star applies to everything this woman writes and says. She is on her FIFTH marriage!!! She has made a mockery of a sacred institution. Why on earth would you put any creedence in anything she says? If you need Barbara Deangelis to tell you what to think and feel you are pathetic!
4,Are You the One For Me?,"Excellent book!!! Recommended by another person that used the advice. Bought one for an acquaintence to help her share in the wisdom. Would recommend to anyone who needs to find his/her soulmate.Dr. DeAngelis has many other inspiring books,too!"
3,"Some good things, some not so good","Bear in mind the author is on husband number 5 and clearly knows her topic thru experience. Oh, and her Ph.D. is from a non-accredited school -which she had to know would be noticed."
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!!!,"This book helped me to realize why I have been dating/choosing the wrong men. Before you get into another relationship, or if you are already in one and wondering how you can tell if that person is the one, READ THIS BOOK FIRST. This book did not sugar coat your answers. Some of them were painful to understand. I realized that I needed to understand my choices. And once you understand why, then you have power. Knowledge is power. I can not stress how much reading this book has changed my life. Thank you Barbara."
4,One of the better popular titles that is out there....,"This is a good book with lots of practical advise, useful exercises and thought provoking material. It invites you to look at your patterns in relationships and provides good guidelines for avoiding unhealthy people and situations.I particularly liked the section in this book on the importance of sexual chemistry. This section also includes a useful quiz for determining how much sexual chemistry you have with a partner. This may sound unnecessary, however, this particular quiz goes beyond mere sexual attraction and includes things that reveal sexual connection in the deepest sense of the word.I don't necessarily agree with everything Barbara De Angelis says, but there is certainly a hefty amount of wisdom between the pages of this book. She is not just telling people what they want to hear either. This makes this title more than just another ""feel good"" self-help book on relationship."
5,FUNNY!!!!!,THIS IS A HILARIOUS MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH I LOVED THIS WHOLE MOVIE ESPECIALLY THE TEDDY BEAR PICNIC SCENE. I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS GREAT AND FUNNY YOU WILL DEFINITELY ENJOY THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE 80'S COMEDY MOVIES.
1,WTF,I like sir mixalot but I will not pay $16.00 for only 4 songs Lol. Come on Sir Mixalot you got more then that in you...
5,Endless Love,"Diana has written a wonderful story that affirms how deep and abiding love for one another can still go on, even after a loved one has passed away. A few months ago I lost my best friend, and reading Send Me Someone was a comforting reminder that yes, even though I can't see her, she is still here with me. Jennifer Basye Sander, author, Heavenly Miracles (Wm. Morrow)"
1,OUCH!,"My husband bought the warm and the tingling. The warm burned... the tingling is a thousand times worse! It reminded me of the pain of getting soap in my urethra, but all over my lower region and much more severe. This product is horrendously painful! Use it if you're a total masochist. Oh, and it does leak. The inside of my dresser drawer is stained from this crap! Try KY touch massage tingling if you want the menthol feel. It doesn't cause pain and it doesn't dry up like durex."
2,I don't recommend this product...,"These lubes are really bad...The bottles are always leaking, and the sensation is horrible...I had to wash myself cause it was burning so bad!!! Avoid!!"
4,Magic Ball Review,I enjoy playing the game. The game is not as challenging as I thought it would be. I like the characters in the game.
5,amazing,"pop in some e and be prepared to fall in love, I will never forget the first time I heard this song"
5,OUTSTANDINGLY AMAZING!!,"this track is one of the best i've ever heard, it's AMAZING!! u've gotta buy it!!"
1,STEP ON this crap !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the first time i heard 'step on' and this band - i was in heaven. very original and just plain fun ! this 'live', actually it's more like, 'extremely dead, throw a shovel of dirt on it' cd is strangely and pathetically worse than bad!!! now, i understand it alot better from the previous reviews and you will too. still, let's do some grading on a 1-10 scale :1. music - if you were there yourself - 92. same music - listening to this cd - 63. production - 14. lead singer's voice (if you want to call it that) - 0(i know i know he was plastered to the gills !!!)"
3,"Fast start at the gates, but ran a short race!","This item worked like a champ, very easy to install and use, but the cooling fan gave up far too soon and it fried!I don't know if I'll ever try another Radeon Video card."
3,"Interesting, but off base","This is a VERY interesting work with obviously a lot of research, but the basic premise, that the abduction experience is evil, just doesn't square with the reactions of many abductees. The entire piece ignores the spiritual aspects of the experiences, and the awesome longing to go ""home"" that most abductees report. I suspect that Mr. Jacobs would benefit from reading some of the works by Dr. John E. Mack: ""Abduction"" and ""Passport to the Cosmos,"" which delve into the deeply transformative and exquisitely spiritual interpretations given by his subjects, not to mention the case reports of Bud Hopkins. Jacobs religiously refuses to consider the possibility of a loving God, a cosmic plan, or a beneficial spiritual evolution that is so apparent in the UFO phenomenon."
1,Science fiction masking as scientific research,"There is really no proof given of the author's assertions. Somehow, abductees are able to breathe and breed no matter where they are in the universe, presumably without life-giving oxygen. People who want to believe this nonsense probably will."
1,Bad Read.,Just another charlatan's view that discredits a topic that's serious and should be explored by scientists. Why would a highly evolved civilization downgrade to humans? We're tribal and stupid. A bunch of bunk. Not even a good read. Sorry I purchased it.
1,Utter garbage,"How can anyone believe this boring, repetitive rubbish? There are no aliens; but there are certainly crooks making money out of gullible fools. Isn't our real world good enough for you? Grow up!"
4,Exact nature of 'threat' not clearly presented,"Great summary of evidence. However, the exact nature of the 'threat' isn't clearly stated. Granted Jacobs isn't privy to the aliens blueprint, however, some concrete scenarios should be considered. How can a few million 'hybrids' (who are near human anyway) take over the world ? If the takeover relies on superior technology (like a naively understood Cortes/Aztec scenario) why don't the aliens just go for it with their tech without relying on hybrids ? Contrarily, if their technology ISN'T up to par for takeover, what else can the hybrids accomplish ? A new voting bloc ? A PAC on capital hill ? Or what ?"
2,A little too sensational and not all that scientific...,"Maybe I'm just not enough of a believer, but the claims made in this book seem a little too sensational and purely based on interpretation of past events, the reconstruction of which through hypnosis is widely debated (and often criticized). However, Dr. Jacobs is a respected academician, so perhaps he should be given the benefit of the doubt. Bottom line: interesting reading, but if you are looking for something convincing on the subject of alien abduction, I wouldn't be too quick to grab this treatment of the topic. P.S. Well written and easy to read."
3,The Good The Bad And The Really Bad,Some of the songs are really cool but some are either to old school or to boring. For example You Can Do It the single with Ice Cube and Mac 10 is a really cool song. But then I here the NWA song and and its not half as good.In a way I think this CD is a waist of money because there are only about 4 good songs.
2,Next Friday Soundtrack Is Not As Good As You Would Expect,"This much hyped about soundtrack is not what you would expect from Ice Cube and company. The key elements from this soundtrack are somehow missing. For example, the new N.W.A.'s song, ""Chin Check,"" is just not the same without the late Eazy-E. No one can replace Eazy-E's spot, and Snoop Dogg's attempt is a little too much to bare. However, some good songs, like Eminem's ""Murder, Murder,"" and unknown artist, Toni Estes's ""Hot,"" may provide a little enjoyment of this soundtrack. Bottom line: Get the CD if you have extra money laying around, but if not, then this CD is not worth buying."
2,So-so CD,"There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy."
4,My boys rip it,"The Big Tymers straight rip it on this album. With that said, the jank wit Lil Zane hot, so is the Ja Rule jank, the NWA is hot, and ya know eminem ripped too. This is a good one, especially since its a soundtrack album, it ain't gonnna get no better in that genre"
5,Ice Cube Can Do It!,"Ice Cube is the man for real. Look at what he has done. Many albums that are bang'n! He brings Too Short out of retirement, in this soudtrack gets N.W.A. back together. What else is there not to respect about him. Then he brings out a HOT sigle that is on fire which is the 1st song on this soundtrack. I mean this man is the realist. Dope movies and all i can't wait to see what he does next. To me Ice Cube is the Millineum Man that just don't stop! He's been in the rap game for years now and can still bring the grade A entertainment. Friday the movie was the bomb now all of a sudden Next Friday is out, and his new album due sometime in 2000! All I can say is respect his mind he's a real hip-hop entertainer!"
4,A couple good songs and a dope comeback for NWA.,"This album is pretty cool. I bought it because I was desperate for something to listen to right quick but I have actually been pleased with it. Especially when I saw that Dr. Dre came back with a new NWA cut. All around it only gets a 3 star but because Ice Cube got Dre back in it with NWA's ""Chin Check"" it can have a four star. Check it out really only if you are into party cuts because none of it lives up to the old school sh*? by these guys. Sorry but its true."
3,ok,"this album has some good songs and some bad songs. i personallylike <shaolin worldwide> and <you can do it>. basically,your $ won't be a waste."
1,very weak,what is this swap meet formula Rap? nothing on this disc matches the first one.very run of the mill and boring.Cube has continued to fall off.avoid this disc at all costs.The NWA comeback is tacky.
2,Not many bright spots,"Most of the tracks on this CD are forgettable, as is the case with most hip-hop soundtracks. The first Ice Cube track is disappointing, which only reaffirms my belief that he has fallen from grace. The N.W.A. track inspires the same feelings. Why are they even back together? The time for this kind of hip-hop has passed. Other big name tracks (Wyclef, Wu-Tang), are unimpressive. The bright spots on this CD come from the lesser known artists (Lil' Zane, Toni Estes). Overall I cannot recommend this CD. The soundtrack to the original Friday was good (if you don't have that one, definitely pick it up), and so was the movie. Unfortunately, this soundtrack is a big disappointment."
3,Dissapointing ....,"The new NWA track is OK but their old stuff is hella tigher nevertheless I still want a new album from them.""Chin Check"" is tight but besides Ice Cube everyone's flow ain't raw.Snoop whole career has been nothing but dissapointments(besides Doggystyle)and it don't stop here,Snoop is crappy.And to the person hatin on the new NWA shut the hell up,stupid!Probaly another crackhead 2Pac fan(2Pac ain't no legend).NWA needs Yella so that the production is more raw cause Dre can't get there no more.Though Cube ain't what he use to be with that dissapionting ""You Can Do It"". But there are tight songs like the Wu Tang joint and etc."
1,man what the hell does anyone know about NWA?,"Man I agree with everyone who knows what that G-RAP is made of! NWA in the year 2000 doesn't make since! M.C. Ren is the only rapper from this new group who hasn't switched up his style or hasn't been on no damn NOTURIOUS PIG dedication cd. So if you like the other rappers then buy it, but too the Mega Hoe Cube and everyone else RETIRE OR SOMETHING!"
3,"As far as soundtrax go, Next Friday is above average","It's a topic most heads dont like discussing---the dreaded hip-hop soundtrack. But ""Next Friday"" is actually better than most. ""Fried Day"" by Bizzy Bone is an amazingly smooth joint reminiscent of ""Buddah Lovaz"" by Bone Thugs. ""Chin Check,"" the first new NWA track in years, is a great track, but its hard to think of it as NWA with Snoop instead of Eazy. ""Shaolin Worldwide"" by Wu succeeds, as does ""Murder Murder"" by Eminem, a track which was originally on his Slim Shady EP. Other decent trax by Pharoahe Monch & Krayzie Bone contribute to the success of the album. The big (and I mean BIG) downfall of this album is the HORRIBLY WACK lead single by Ice Cube, ""You Can Do It."" As you listen to him chant the chorus ""you can do it put your back into it"" it makes you wonder what happened to the Cube of the early 90's that we knew and loved."
5,Not Better than the first,"This was a cool soundtrack fulled with a various amount of artists. Featuring;Ice Cube, Mack 10 , Ca$h Money, Eminem, KuRupt, Frost,Krayzie &Bizzy Bone,Jarule feat.Vita and more. You Can Do It with Ice Cube Mack 10 and Ms. Toi was a good song on this album. Mamacita featuring Kurupt and more was anothjer tight song to check out. And this album was also the return of the biggest rap group ever. The NWA feat. Snoop and the best song on the album titled Chin Check. The song was blazin hot. All the artist had pretty good songs on this album. This was a cool album for any hip hop fan. It's worth buying. But the first Soundtrack was better than this one I have to admit. This is still a good cd and shouldn't be looked by. Peace out. NO LIMIT 2000"
2,Depends On Your Taste...,"I was hyped to get this album because of the singles I'd heard on the radio and seen on BET. But to tell the truth the only good tracks on the album are Ice Cube and Ms. Toi's ""You Can Do It"", Toni Estes' ""Hot"", and the BEST track of all, Aaliyah's ""I Don't Wanna"". I can already tell you that single will be HOT, and it's enough to buy the CD just for that song. But as a DIRTY SOUTH hotgirl, I was SOOOO disappointed in ""Good Friday"", the track with Big Tymers and Lil' Wayne. If you're still into Bone and NWA I guess you'd like the album. But even if you don't, the Toni Estes and Aaliyah will not disappoint."
1,sets a dangerous precedent,"It is a *very bad idea* to teach kids to sniff markers. While this kind may be harmless, the same cannot be said for dry erase markers which are also commonly used now in schools. Just one incident with an inhalant can be deadly. If you really insist on giving these to kids, please make certain they know that sniffing is not allowed for all markers!"
1,What a waste! IRS gives it for free.,This book is nothing more than the Pub 17 available for free by downloading from the IRS web site. It does have some nice notes but the US Gov't should demand that Ernst & Young pay royalties to them...that's us taxpayers. No wonder the Big Five is now the Big Four and if this is what is out there perhaps soon to be the Big Three. E&Y has shown us a very poor example of business ethics.
4,True Western,"So many Western movies have the white hats & the black hats, the law, and straight shooters all around. Rewind to the beginnings...to when families in covered wagons began the treks out West to find a better life. This the West that is being portrayed here. It's about four families making a huge gamble to make it to Oregon by taking a short cut with the help of a rugged looking, bear-man named Meek. But looks are deceiving and the open plains don't show any mountains where they should. By the time the families know something is wrong, they were in a heap of trouble...or were they? This movie will make you wonder and then stand back in awe on how families set out into the unknown. Some relied on the Bible, some on critical thinking. Michelle Williams gives an outstanding performance in this one."
2,Meeks Cutoff,"An odd film. Nice attention to the look of the era but the movie never really gets there. Sadly, I would not recomend it."
3,ATMOSPHERIC BUT SLIGHT (AND NOT WIDESCREEN!),"It's 1845 along the Oregon Trail. Three families in a wagon train hire mountain man Stephen Meek to guide them over the rugged Cascade Mountains. Meeks claims to know a shortcut and leads the families across a high plains desert where they become lost and must fight for their survival. But the real problem is the dilemma of believing a man who has failed them or placing their trust a Native American - a feared enemy -- who stumbles across the desperate families.Director Kelly Reichardt perfectly captures the loneliness and harsh, unforgiving environment in this engrossing tale based on harrowing real events. But why is it not presented in a widescreen format. Finally, a strange, well-acted film that has a great sense of time and place but is somehow unsatisfying."
2,Dumped in the desert.,"This movie was very realistic and a lot of effort was spent on detail. The scenery and characters also were believable. The story never tried to be a typical western. By the time it was over, I was more drained and tired than the characters. The only interesting part was, what the Indian was up to. Was he setting a trap? Was he amusing himself, watching them suffer, and search for water? The ending explained nothing. There is never a beginning, or an ending. I wonder if the book ended that way too? Just dumped in the desert. One word will sum it up. Tedious."
2,What is the point?,"I am a bit relieved that this wasn't one of those movies I didn't care for that got loads of great reviews. This was recommended by friends of ours. I agree with the overall rating from the reviewers on this one. The scenery is great, and would have been nice on the big screen. BUT, the movie is tedious. It starts slow, and part way in I have to put on the subtitles, because we just couldn't hear some of the dialogue. It got a bit more interesting in the middle, but about the time I was expecting a conclusion, the ending credits came on. As far as the cast, the one woman had a really irritating voice, and another melted down in a way that drove me up the wall. Michelle Williams was the highlight, and if the others we actually supposed to be that annoying, kudos to the casting crew. I looked at the screen at the end and thought that I just wasted almost 2 hours. If not for the scenery and a bit of the middle, it is a one-star movie."
1,Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space Look Like High Drama,"I have watched thousands of movies over the last 50+ years and this ranks as the worst I have ever wasted 2 hours of my life on. Without question the stupidest ending ever. No character development, pointless story that goes nowhere. DO NOT rent, buy, borrow or watch this movie."
1,Cutoff After 35 Minutes!,"Well-meaning but painfully ponderous slice of hard-scrabble realism that I refused to waste any time watching. After 35 minutes, I hit the stop button. This is a film that tries so hard to immerse the viewers into the austere, sparse experience of pioneer life that its director forgot that certain cinematic conventions such lighting and sound need to be maintained so as not to distract. I'm only guessing but the other oddity of this misguided attempt is the 4x3 aspect ratio---was it employed to lend a reality-tv feel to the whole affair?"
1,Most Boring Movie in 40 Yrs,"I screened this movie in anticipation of purchasing it for my Dad, who loves classic westerns like those starring Tom Selleck, Bob Duvall etc. Thank goodness I did. I'm annoyed enough from sitting through THE MOST BORING MOVIE IN 40 YEARS, IN ANY GENRE. If I paid actual money, I'd be furious.Here's the plot: Lost homesteaders wander around the desert. There - I just saved you 2 hrs. You're welcome! There are good stories about the Oregon Trail that would make terrific movies. Why they approved this thing for production is beyond me. It's a DOG!I sincerely hope moviemakers release a decent Western before Christmas, because otherwise I'm stuck for what to buy!"
1,You got to be kidding me!,"You have got to be kidding, is the exact words I uddered when this movie ended, wait when it stopped, because there was no ending. The reviewer who said they went nowhere to get nowhere was correct. I watched alot of it in fast forward, just to get to a place where something happens it never did.you can not hear some parts and can't see others. They gathered firewood 3 times and guess what Those were probably the most exciting parts in this movie. I still watched to the end thinking something has to come out of this, but no. The movie simply ends.If you are a laid back person with alot of time to waste you might gamble with this. Even then I would't recommend it. If your a western fan such as me, this will be a complete waste of your time. This is the second western DVD that I have traded in, I usally keep all westerns, unless they are awful. This one is aweful if you can even truly call it a western."
1,What Was the Point of the This Movie?,"I kinda feel like the title of my review says it all. The writing was unbelievably poor - and nonexistent within the first 10 minutes, at least! The characters were unsympathetic and even annoying. The plot, to the extent that there was a plot, had no resolution to it.What was the point?"
2,Nice Try,"This is one of those beautifully photographed atmospheric Westerns that never really goes anywhere. Literally.SPOILER ALERT! Some Plot Elements Will Be Discussed!The film opens on the Oregon Trail. There is no background presented. The viewer is left to piece the story together.I rented it because I am very interested in The Lost Blue Bucket Mine. And the folks do find some gold nuggets. Which is more than I can say as a viewer.My biggest beef is nothing really happens. Eventually the film ends as it began - the journey hasn't ended.The photography is beautiful, which is why I gave it two stars. It is well acted, given the constraints of the script (ie, no real plot). Motion and action are not an adequate substitute for a story.It is very realistic. I liked Stephen Meeks' tall tales.But, bottom line, nothing much happens to these good people. Or for the viewer."
1,A horrible waste of time and money,This movie was awful. It had no plot and ended abruptly. Truly a disappointment. I have nothing more to say about this movie.
1,meeks cutoff,"This movie doesn't even rate a one star. i don't think i have ever saw a worse movie in my life. it started out going nowhere and got there, no where..they didn't reach any where. save your money, don't even think about buying it. everything about it was bad....."
1,We're Being Punk'd...Right?,"I wish I'd looked this movie up on-line before buying it at Target. Quick Summary: The beginning was slow, the middle was slower---and the (predictable) ending took a nap. All the actors were mediocre at best. The dialog was clumsy and oftentimes non-sensible. (Were they adlibbing...or what?) The night scenes were horrendous! I've seen movies from the 30's and 40's with better lighting technique than this one had. Instead of the super fancy (albeit cumbersome) packaging done for their commercial-driven DVD...they should have used that money to pay for state-of-the-art lighting equipment. Lastly, I do hope the director was not trying to suggest that the ""script-method"" and the ""three women"" displayed in this movie even remotely compare to Robert Altman's movie of 3 Women. Enough said. YOU GET THE PICTURE..."
4,WARNING-THIS BOOK IS THE PLAYSTATION 2 VERSION,"I just wanted to say this, because I wanted to get the PC version but accidentilly got this instead, as their was no warning to what it was(Apparently, they have enlarged the cover shot though). However, I did look through it. While there are so many levels it can cover the endless stratgies for each one(look on the wep for those) it does give some of the major tips and secrets of the levels. Seems to be pretty good overall."
3,Confusing Reiki,"The Book is good only for and education but not for Reiki practition. Because in this book describe reiki in very general Review. In this book doesn't specify which reiki she will describe Western Reiki or Eastern Reiki. All the message in the book are mixed up and for the Reiki Pactitioner will confuse when read it. Is it OK for the common people , but after they know the truth about Reiki , they will whats right and whats wrong.For The technique & illustration , I will give 4 starBut the review to shortly , people must have to read another book."
5,Lovely,Well made and very beautiful. We just remodeled our bathroom and will use these brackets for the open shelving. I am very pleased with them.
3,Too short,"I am ambivalent about this product. On one hand, what Brian Tracy is saying is some really powerful stuff and I believe all of it works, if only I had the tenacity to implement all that he's suggesting in my own life. But only 2 hours? I hope these CDs have a high replay value, or I'm going to be bitter about my ""investment"".We'll see. Maybe these CDs will make me a better achiever or they won't. If yes, then I'll come back and give them 5 stars :)"
3,Slow Down!!,"Very good infromation, however he talks too fast! if he would just pause a few seconds, as Stephen Covey is so good at, it would be much easier to ""take in "" all this infromation"
5,"Might be discontinued by 3Com, but works great!","This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase."
5,"A very, very nice watch.","The picture is slightly misleading, the metal in the picture looks like brushed stainless steel, almost white, but the actual watch has metal that is slightly darker. It's hard to describe, but imagine a very light gray color.If anything, it looks better than it does in the picture. A beautiful watch, sturdy thus far, and all for a very decent price. If you're trying to decide between this watch and another, I would suggest this one be your choice."
4,Silly and satirical,"This book is all silliness and satire. Retief is the very capable straight man in a world of send-ups of various stereotypes.If puns don't offend you, you may well enjoy this book. It certainly made me smile."
5,"A ""new"" Retief arises","I had my doubts when this pistache appeared, but I am now a true believer. It is the original Retief back. If you have ever read Laumer's Retief you will love it. If not you will discover a new love and likely end up buying all the originals."
3,Not Timmon's Best Work.,"Andy Timmons is one of the most under rated guitarists performing today. That being said, this CD does not demonstrate his guitar playing potential. For that, you would need to buy EarXtacy, or EarXtacy 2. This CD does not begin cooking until the 3rd song on the CD--""Cashbox"". Its there that Timmons plays a solo that will raise the hair on the back of your neck. On the upside, you get seventy minutes of electrified blues and rock on 13 tracks. Overall, its not a bad CD but it's certainly not Timmon's best stuff."
4,Become the empowered being you were always meant to be ...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't usually make notes in the books I read, but this one for some reason had me underlining, highlighting and making my own notes on the pages as I went along! Great stuff, it really resonated with me. The book is of great help if you wish to start becoming more aware of your inner child and boundaries in relation to other people. If you don't know when/how/why people are pushing your buttons, you can't stop reacting and begin to find your equilibrium and inner peace. I also loved the spiritual connection that went along with the theme of this book."
3,Codependence / The Dance of Wounded Souls,"The quality of information in this very small book (only 127 pages) depends on the depth of your own personal journey of healing. Burney spins a silver thread of basic Jungian philosophy of spirituality that illuminates his own journey. We are spiritual beings created perfectly by God, learning about life and how to get back to God in a physical body. That's it. This is the extent of Burney's entire message. If you are just beginning, this book may offer rich insights for your spiritual growth. If you have been searching for depth beyond the quagmire of self-help books and seminars that have been available for the past twenty years, and/or you are seeking and searching beyond your personal work through a ""twelve step"" program and meeting, this author offers a mere one-minute-review of many notables. My rating is ""disappointed"" for the price of the book."
3,Good start and a clear characterization of codependency,"This book is very clear and precise in characterizing codependency. The message linking a cultural ""codependence"" to a spiritual disease, while not new or novel, is compelling presented within a 12 step context. However, Burney is rather repetitive at times throughout the book and somewhat vague in terms of the book serving as a guide how to effect change. A good start for those beginning the journey inward in healing. However, there are other sources much more concrete to help one find the way through the process of healing through a spiritual path."
5,Adorable Story!,"I absolutely loved this book, and can't for the life of me understand the negative reviews. As an elementary music teacher, I will definitely use this book in my classroom. The pictures are beautiful, and the writing style is so charming. For dog lovers and music lovers (I happen to be both), this book makes a perfect combination. What a treasure!"
4,Another fine CD by Hiroshima,"Very nice instrumentals on this CD, just what I expect and love to hear from Hiroshima. I've been a fan of Hiroshima since the 80s, and as long as they continue to produce CDs I'll keep on buying them.Track #6, ""Another wish,"" is my favorite. it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face! I liked ""Believe,"" but ""Caravan of love"" wasn't enough. I can't figure out ""Sever rivers."" What can I say, it's weird!Terry Steele is a fine vocalist, but I can't see him as being a regular member of the band. We Hiroshima fans need to start a petition to have Barbara Long (who was the lead singer on ""Go"" and ""Another place"") return to the band and sing on their next album. I miss her talent for singing!Although this CD isn't as good as ""Between Black and White,"" The Bridge is still worthy of my Hiroshima collection and makes for an enjoyable listening experience."
2,One Song Album,"Bought this album because I heard the song Eternal Phoenix on Pandora Radio one day, and liked it. Smooth Jazz music. I hoped the rest of the album would have something likeable on it, it didn't. This is a One Song Album. If you like Smooth Jazz, and like this one song, buy it individually as a download. The album is a disappointment."
3,Rebel XT canon tripod,"I thought this product was ok. This was a birthday gift to a friend of mine. It took me a while to figure out the parts of the tripod. Once I took a screw out, i couldnot put it back together. Overall i would rate this as OK, usable."
5,Classic of an up and coming singer/songwriter,"As Phil becomes more widespread and his music more universal, this album will serve as a wonderful reminder from where he came, and how his work has always been great. This album is both provocative and simple as it spurs thought and memory."
2,disappointing after father of frankenstein,"Thoroughly enjoyed Father of Frankenstein, but found this book difficult and unpleasant. Protagonist's voice was grating and clubby, assumming I was sympathetic and knowing of all his stereotypical positions. Treatment of politics was heavy handed and unsubtle. Didn't feel like an attempt to reach anyone other than people who already ""think like him."""
1,Shallow and insipid,"I've read most of Bram's books, and this was by far the most dissappointing. The idea of a liberal and conservative gay man falling in love should be rife with possibilities. Instead, the auther never truly examines the characters' motives. He offers conflicting views instead of character depth. And what begins as a potential love story, views wildly off course to become a murder mystery (who cares?) and a melodrama. I would hope that another auther will find this premise and truly explore it for all it's possibilities."
5,"Awesome -- great leap forward for ""gay fiction""","Bram continues to take the genre gay ficton to higher plateaus. In GOSSIP, he explores the phenomenon of aol dates and on-line chatrooms and the weirdness of log cabin republicans (whatever!), and weaves a compelling tale of murder and intrigue to rival the best pulp fiction writers. This is a terrific read!"
3,I was not disappointed,"No this movie is not an Academy Award Winner. However, since I am a Substance Abuse Counselor I found great Value in the context of this movie. If you want to see the effects of substance abuse and keeping secrets has on families then this is a good representative."
1,I'm glad I only rented it ...,"I've never heard of this movie, but when I saw it at ...[the local video store], I just knew it was going to be good...NOT!... Larenz Tate was great to look at, and Deborah Cox, I could listen to her sing all day. But that movie was just dumb. What was the point to it? It was just no story line at all. First of all, I think they should have used a biracial child to play Larenz's part, because they were all off in that area. Maybe they should have had their friend play it. It would have been more believable. Oh well, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Not as good as I thought,"Well I saw this movie and I really didn't like it too much. It was just too much and just too little in it. Would I ever watch this again, NO!"
4,Twisted but slightly predictable,"After seeing the movie Payback, I decided to delve into some of the new Parker novels and this was the first one. I enjoy any plot that includes robbing snake-oil salesmen (an evangelist) and dishonor among theives so this book was very enjoyable. The writing style is sparse and moving so it is a light read, but the style lends itself to being predictable. So little detail is included that when it is given by the author, you know that it is somehow going to be involved later. All in all, if you enjoy reading tight, well-written novels from the criminal's perspective, then you will enjoy this novel. Parker is a talented, harsh theif who knows how to remain focused and finish the job even with things spinning out of control. Though this novel doesn't demonstrate just how hard Parker can be, you get enough of a taste to know if you want to read more."
3,A decent thriller - nothing special,"This is a good, solid read. It held my interest, but it's not a knockout thriller. A decent book to wile away a few hours. Because it's out of print, available copies appear to be rather pricey. But it's not the kind of book worth paying a premium price for - really, it's nothing special."
3,"Good performance, bad mastering","As the amazon description notes, this DVD contains a TV special recorded back in the early 60's. It seems to be a complete show and it is simply introduced as ""Mahalia Sings"". It is a B&W video and it has 13 chapters. Mahalia wears a choir robe during the show and she performs against a church setting. I can not tell if it's a live performance since the sound is very poor, basically transferred from a analog tape to a DVD without any cleaning or mastering. The video quality is OK for the age of the video. And since this is a bargain release I did not expect much. It was nice to see Mahalia performing Christmas classics."
1,VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO ALL THE TRUE ROCKERS!!!!!,"SHOP BOYZ come out of nowhere and have a hit single about partys and rockstar. in the video i did not see anything rockstar-ish. it looked more like a ""party like a HONKY'. in the lyrics i didnt hear them give homage to all the Black rockers. i would go into all the black rockers but it would just probably make them mad!!!!if they really wanted to party like true rockstars they would have dont it for the fun of it and not for the money.-5 stars out of 5"
1,A masterpiece dumbed down for the Lloyd Webber fans,"While I appreciated this production included some of the original French lyrics, that's about the only good thing I can find to say about it. The performances are loud and all of one-note and completely miss the emotional subtlety of Brel's work. When the performers are not going over the top in their emoting, they're destroying Brel's melodic lines by speaking the lyrics. The gorgeous vocal harmonies of the original production are almost non-existent here and the orchestrations, in their electronic discord and overamplification, speak more of Elton John's hideous ""Aida"" than they do of a collection of French chansons.If you really want to appreciate Brel's work, go back to the original production of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well . . . or, better yet, listen to any of the numerous recordings by Brel himself."
1,Flashing Monitor,"I purchased this monitor extention and tried it on my NEC LCD monitor but the screen flashed when it was hooked up. I tried another one with the same results, so I unplugged it, dragged my CPU up close to my monitor so it would reach with my old 6' cord, and began searching the net for a better cable."
4,Cool color,"Chips after a while, even with top coat, HOWEVER! It is still a good polish, and the color is decent. Like a clay-ish pink."
4,GARBO: A STUDY,"A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY ON THE MAKING OF A LEGEND. ALTHOUGH MAKE-UP ARTISTS, COSTUME DESIGNER ADRIAN, PHOTOGRAPHERS, & CAMERAMAN WILLIAM DANIELS DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAKING OF GARBO, LIKE WITH MARILYN MONROE, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT SET GARBO APART FROM ALL OTHERS THAT IS BEYOND ARTIFICE & ILLUSION-- AN INNER GIFT THAT CANNOT BE TAUGHT, LEARNED, OR BOUGHT. I BELIEVE GARBO WAS OBLIVIOUS TO THIS GIFT & HER STARDOM WAS INEVITABLE. OVERALL A GOOD BOOK ON A GREAT PERSONALITY."
4,Respect for International Hip Hop...,"Hip Hop has spread across the globe, yet Americans does not appreciate this artform coming out from anyplace other than America. The Streets is one example of what Americans are missing out on. Clever rhyme patterns and wordplay is used throughout this lp. Hip Hop with Garage beats. You can experience some trip-hop on this records as well. Give it a try!"
1,British people can't rap,"I ONLY PICKED ONE STAR BECAUSE I COULDN'T PICK ZERO!! What kind of people listen to this stuff?! The thing that really irritates me is that there is now less oxygen in the world because the Streets use it to rap. (...). This music is about as interesting as tea and krumpets with my grandmother. Blimy this music blows. Buggar, buggar, buggar. Bloody hell this music smells like arse."
1,"This is a Joke, Right?",When I first heard one of their songs I thought is was a joke and someone was messing around. Then when I realized it was a real band I couldn't belive it. I would rather listen to NSYNC than these guys. Damm whats going over in Britian.
1,English rap................................................?,"What the.... is going on in the world today? English guys rapping about total nonsense, no, i don't think it's worth your money, i'll tell you something worth your money. how about STONE SOUR or TRAPT or ERASE THE GREY, or, if u want to hear white rappers, check out EMINEM (who ...), BUBBA SPARXXXX (somefat-... hillbilly dude), or even VANILLA ICE (u know, the best rapper ever!!).THE STREETS = awful music.English rap....................................................................................................?What the [heck] is english rap?The STREETS are English rap.[Forget] the f------g Streets and go for some reel pirate material. C ya 'l l ... later!Peace,50 aka Ferrari F-50 (HA!)"
5,Very Innovative,I found this cd to be the most original music to come out in a while. The lyrics are great as are the beats. I reccomend it to anyone.
2,Forget Hype this aint the sound of the underground,"Listened to this 'cause of some of the rave reviews and am mystified.I assure you I have read the lyrics closely and listened to the album (borrowed).It is gimmicky. Over-hyped. It is too self-conciously trying to be british street culture for its own good and forgetting the most important thing - the music.Anyone can produce an album like this - just carry a dictaphone around with you the pubs and clubs in london. Then recite in a clumsy way some of things you hear on play back to basement beats and rhyme now and again. Also, don't do it in time.The dilemma is that if he sang in a brummie accent it would even be more hilarious but he opts for mockney.Some of this is cringeworthy in the extreme. I am dying of embarrassment.Ian Dury he 'aint. What a waste!"
4,"Weak in some spots, but well done in others.","I was first introduced to The Streets by my brother, who heard him on NPR. Hunter sent me ""Weak Become Heros,"" and I was instantly hooked. Being a poet myself, I found The Streets' wordplay to be eloquent and well thought out, such as the line in ""It's Too Late"": ""Now nothing holds significance, nothing holds relevance/Because all I can think about is her elegance.""I agree strongly with the sentiment that The Streets is not a rapper per se, but rather a poet. So some of his attempts at more ""traditional"" hip hop don't really touch me the same way as some of his more edgy works, like ""Weak Become Heros"" or ""Turn The Page.""All in all, I liked this CD enough to buy it... and that says something."
4,FUN! I love this album.,"It's fun, it's funky, the beats are pretty good, the rapping is alright, and it's easy groove to.It might take more than one listen to get into it, but it's worth it."
4,"Extra Extra, Street's Album provides hope for rap's future!","I used to really like rap, but now the genre has become tiresome and bloated. It is only when an artists comes along with something truly new and different that rap becomes interesting again. Mike Skinner (a.k.a. The Streets) has done that. By rapping about the life and struggles of a Brittish working class citizen he creates images and relates ideas that have far more in common with most rap fans than Bling Bling and Hot Booty. On ""Don't Mug Yourself"" he raps about the dangers of falling too quickly for a young ""bird"" and the help his friends offer. On the single currently being featured on The Much Music USA Network, ""Let's Push Things Forward"", he asks why as music listeners, we keep settling and consuming the same old pop ..., and don't ask for something different and better. On Original Pirate Material, he provides just this."
4,Which is it?,"Ok, the Streets have an amazing sound. But what genre do they fall under? Does anybody know?"
4,"Not Hip Hop, thank god!","Firstly I will say that this album is not attempting to be anything like Jammaster J, Nas, or any other crappy Rap ""artists"". This album is a dance album, the kind of album that you can chill out to as background music or something. The difference between this and rap music is that the album isnt trying to brag about bling, money and hoes. It's quite the opposite, it's about the life of the British working class of living at the weekends and being bored the rest of the time. You won't get that unless you've experienced it.The reason I've given it 4 stars is that becuase he produced it in his bedroom by himself, the production isnt as good as it could have been - hopefully ""A Grand Don't Come For Free"" will be better, and from what I've heard - ""Blinded by the lights"", ""Fit but you know it"", ""Dry your eyes"", it certainly is.To finish off - I saw them at reading festival 2004 and they were superb, go the streets and mr. skinner!!"
1,I know one A+R guy who should lose his gig :),"He tried something different. I'll always give points for that. I just dont like it very much. It's verging on annoying. The thing I guess I dislike the most is the mountain of great press it has gotten. I dont quite get where all the good words are coming from.I havent ever really trusted the press when it comes to buying albums, but, in this case they had really poured it on. ANNOYING!The only rapper from the UK that has moved me is ROOTS MANUVA. If you want to check out something cool from the UK......get ""Run Come Save Me"" by ROOTS MANUVA.I wish I had something nicer to say about this album. BAD RHYMES,BAD BEATS,BAD SONGS,BAD A LOT OF STUFF......."
3,Original pirate material? Original indeed.,"Aside from the Beastie Boys, I really don't listen to much rap/hip-hop. Then after reading glowing reviews about Mike Skinner a.k.a. The Streets in various music publications like Q Magazine, Rolling Stone, Spin, and Entertainment Weekly, I decided to buy OPM. All I can say is that it's not a bad effort. In fact, it's fairly decent. To say that he is the Eminem of the UK (as some have said), well that's stretching it a bit. So what you should expect if you should listen to this? Expect an English rapper with a heavy cockney accent rapping about adolescent life in the UK over two-step garage music (made popular by singers like Craig David, etc.). The only drawback is that Mike's voice can get a little monotonous after a while, and the repetitive background music can be somewhat bothersome as well. Still, OPM is worth a listen. Give The Streets a chance. By the way, I rate this three and a half stars."
3,One very big complaint,"This is one of those albums that I respect but would never listen to by choice. The production has a nice tinny sound, and its emphasized by soulful synth chords. The lyrics are poignant, funny, and extremely honest. They paint a great picture of ordinary street life. The only problem is that they are put to the ear by a lazy, unenthusiastic voice that rambles on without rythm. Back in the day people complained rapping and how it just sounded like talking. Well, those complaints would be valid with this one. The strong english accent doesn't bother me. It's that there is nothing musical about skinners flow. Any kind of vocal rhythm is nowhere to be found. The songwriting is solid, the production is solid, but the guy just sounds like books on tape."
4,eduardo the thicko,"What is he like? that guy just didn't cop on to what original pirate material is about; its SUPPOSED to be rough. he knows hes not a good rapper, thats why he 'raps' so eagerly. the lyrics are very smart, the music is varied and involving and he really doesn't take himself THAT seriously - why else would he put 'dont mug yourself' on the album? Now there are some dodgy songs on the album, but depending on your taste id say anyone who listened to the album found different songs annoying. Buy the album if you hate garage, cus this IS NOT GARAGE, its simply good music."
5,Smart and entertaining,"This is the best thing I've heard in a while, I am still enjoying it months after my first listen. The real treats here are the clearly articulated lyrics. Skinner's ""day in the life of a geezer"" paints an lifestyle without pretense or posturing, but with clever turns of phrase and an attitude light years beyond stupid. Musically, you could call it (UK) garage, but it's not really a dancefloor album, it's a listening album that references club culture."
5,This is a first class album,"This is a top-notch album. Mike Skinner is a lyrical genious. I thought Eminem had good lyrics, but skinner beats that wanna be black man hands down. Nearly every track on this cd is superb both in terms of lyrics and general enjoyment to listen to. Def worth buyin. peace out"
4,Good beats but off beat...makes it interesting though,"The first time my friend showed me ""Let's push things forward,"" I said what any avid American would say that listens to rap a lot...""THAT SOUNDS OFF-BEAT AS HELL!"" My friend replied, ""What? It isn't off beat."" A month later I downloaded the song and found myself listening to it over and over again. After previewing other songs too, it's a whole different breed of hip-hop, I'll tell you that much. The main rapper starts rapping in the middle of time signitures, which a lot of people aren't used to over in America, but it makes the songs sound interesting. There are such good beats on the album, but I think it would sound a lot better if the guy rapped faster and more on beat. Instead, he raps like its flat out poetry put to music....now that's interesting."
5,Literally ORIGINAL PIRATE MATERIAL,"The streets are the only hip-hop/rap that i listen to because not only do they not fall into the same category as all other rap they made their own kind. The thing I like most about this album is how different it is. Ive never heard an album like this and I probably never will again.The voice is as amazing as the lyrics and the beats are equally good. The hilarious slang used in the lyrics makes the song very enjoyable as with the rest of the stange combos that make up The Streets. I personally thought that ""The Irony of it All"" (a song where Skinner switches from and angry drunk to a peaceful pot head that is making the points of why marijuana should be legalized) was the best song on the album. So if you are looking for an original british rap album then buy The Streets , Original Pirate Material."
2,Not quite...,This CD is anything but a musical achievement. Most of the record just sounds as though a man has recorded himself talking over beats put out by his keyboard. The tone is rather monotonous and lacks creativity. The lyrics are disconnected and laughable. My main use for this CD is entertaining friends who find it as ridiculous as I do.
1,Funny; 2 toes down; Hillarious,"This album...wow. What can I say? I mean, its funny, I heard the first single and I almost blacked out from laughing. Oh man, let me tell you...its a terrible album. Come on guys, what can be better than an ENGLISH RAPPER? The answer itself is in the question. Take my review into consideration when thinking of an album to buy for a laugh."
2,Absolutely Terrible,Hip hop and a british accent just don't mix. I loved the album until Skinner starting rhyming... then it was all downhill from there. Absolutely awful!
4,A Hilarious Album...why is everyone taking it so seriously?,"A musicly-inclined friend of mine first played this albut for me a few weeks ago, and I thought the whole thing was incredibly amusing. Then, I read their rave review in Rolling Stone. I couldn't believe that people actually take this guy seriously. As a lyrical exercise, as an artistic endeavor, I can understand how people can respect the value of this album, but I hardly think this is the best new album of the year. I assumed ""The Streets"" was more of a satire on the present music scene, not a serious white-rap album. I guess I might be the only one."
5,original.. that's for sure,"let's get one thing clear.. this is not rap. i don't really know how to classify it, but it's not rap. mike skinner rhymes over unique beats and to be honest, it sounds good. his rhymes are abstract and takes you all over the place. he talks about birds, geezers, clubs, and drugs among many things, but does so in a way i've never heard before. this album sounds amazing considering he recorded it in his bedroom. if you're looking for something new and an english accent doesn't bother you, check out the streets! just as good as this album is The Street's follow-up, A Grand Don't Come For Free.tracks worth checking out:Turn The Page (best opening song on any album i've ever heard)Too Much BrandyDon't Mug YourselfIt's Too LateIrony Of It All (weed vs. alchohol)Stay Positive (a description of himself during a heroine addiction)"
4,I don't even listen to rap and I still give it 4 stars,"My buddy had played me a couple of tracks from this CD a year or two ago, and it had stayed with me ever since. So I finally sought out this album.There must be something about the American rap ""style"" that is an instant turn-off; maybe it's all the bling-in-your-face attitude. Ugh. But the poetic eloquence here--the meaning behind these words--seems somehow to hit home.""Turn the page"" is freakin brilliant, no matter what you call it; rap, poetry, music, whatever.I'm not saying every track is a masterpiece, but when something is obviously special it deserves special attenton."
4,A Quirky Group of Blokes,"I first read about these fellas from across the pond in NME. I saw ""Don't Mug Yourself"" on MTV2 and I thought I'd give it a shot. Overwhelmingly the album is better than you'll think. White rapper who talks about social issues? No, Mike Skinner is not the British Eminem. Instead, The Streets have a unique sound in the hip hop world with better than average lyrics. I recommend ""it's too late"" ""stay positive"" ""the irony of it all"" and ""don't mug yourself"" for those getting-ready-to-go-get-bombed evenings."
5,Best There Is,"To me streets cannot be beaten. I do have a wide variety of music. But streets will always come out top.I just feel they have invented a genre of their own. I just can't describe it because it isn't quite rap but not quite club but a blend of both, and with Mike Skinner as there front man. They're just a very unique band.If you are reading this review and haven't got this album I would recommend it."
5,Blistering debut,"Mike Skinner arrives in a gritty blaze of glory to establish himself as one of England's finest young songwriters. Skinner, 22, raps about the street life of dreary working-class England with a refreshing sincerity and an uncommon wit, blowing away the bloated commercialism of the UK garage scene with a blistering debut of hip-hop/garage genius. 'The Irony Of It All' is a hilarious, Eminem-influenced insight into the debate over the legalisation of cannabis, while 'Stay Positive' offers a heartfelt snapshot of a descent into heroin addiction, laced over a combination of beats and strings reminiscent of RZA's best work on Wu-Tang Forever. For garage fans, meanwhile, 'Has It Come To This' provides the radio-friendly unit-shifter. I'm open to considering that Mike Skinner just might be Britain's best lyricist since Richey Edwards, and this album, his debut no less, is nothing short of essential."
2,"Not hip-hop, not spoken word, just disappointing","I bought this expecting some British hip-hop with garage beats. The beats are ok, but the lyrics are boring. This is only spoken word in the literal sense; Saul Williams or Ken Nordine could annihilate Mike Skinner with a single sentence. Skinner also lacks any sort of charisma or mic personality. Was it Iriscience who said ""MC's without a voice should write a book?""All in all, this was a disappointing purchase. If you're a fan of 2-step / garage / whatever, and are looking for some vocals, it might suite you. If you want British hip-hop, stick with Roots Manuva, Mark B & Blade, or Rodney P."
2,Don't fall for it,"If you're looking for interesting British hip hop, this is not the best place to start. Some of the beats here are interesting and two tracks, ""Let's Push Things Forward"" and ""Has It Come To This?"" surprisingly really complement Mike Skinner's zero-flow aesthetic. But it's weird that critics seem to have latched onto this sub-par emcee with the awkward name (what, we're just supposed to breeze over the fact that your name is ""The Streets""?), when there's so much better hip hop coming out of the UK. Try anything on Ninjatune subsidiary Big Dada, especially Roots Manuva's recent output. If you're just looking for a funny accent, try Tricky's ""Juxtapose,"" which features several tracks showcasing the hyper-fast (and most unintelligible) verbal antics of Maddog, a perfect counterpoint to Tricky's raspy, slow-as-cough-syrup murmurings."
1,just plain bad,"This album is amazingly bad. Wow. This album is so bad, that I decided to write my first ever Amazon review. This album made me give up my traditional role of reader. The rhymes aren't clever or interesting. Uh. And the music, wow, that is bad too. It's like English bad techno by the book. It is essentially a gimic album, with the gimic being that he is English, and says stuff like 'Birds.' English people can rap, just not this guy. Once again, so bad."
3,Entertainment at its finest,"If I had to pick 1 word to describe this CD, it would be:Laughable.There is nothing better then hearing sloshed-up british men ""rapping"" (or talking) over beats that are made off some keyboard that a retro band wouldv'e used in the mid 80's. Seriously - it sounds like a producer warped back into the past, graped a few thrown away Phil Colin beat's, that were made off an old Casio Keyboard, and brought back to the present and is now using them for rap....... and strangely, I find it oddly appealing, and entertaining. Perhaps because I haven't heard something this rediculous since Wierd Al Yancovich, that I think everyone should give this CD atleast 1 listen. If you get anoyed half way through, dont feel ashasmed to burn it in the name of hip-hop."
1,as good as eminem...........?,"........NO. I am now dumber for having heard this album. I think it destroyed more brain cells than all the drugs I've taken in my life combined. If ""the Streets"" ever went into the streets with this garbage he wouldn't make it out. He doesn't even rhyme on beat. As Wu-Tang said, ""it takes years for this"". If y'all like this, I got lots of pre-demo tracks for my album that might get me a record deal if this is all it takes these days."
1,rubbish,"i cannot express how much this artist annoys me. it's not rap, and that fact is in and of itself neither a good nor a bad thing-there's plenty of good hip-hop and plenty of bad hip-hop. i don't even care if this album fits into a genre-it just sucks. the beats are uniformly uninspired, sloppy, and irritating. his ""delivery"" is jarring and unpleasant.i strongly recommend not buying this record."
1,"Not rap music, and not good.","This album is garbage--which shouldn't matter because there's lots of other garbage to complain about. It's only when garbage gets ""critical acclaim"" that I'm upset. First of all, rap music is largely about rhythm and flow and this so-called emcee has neither. Second, it's not that witty--it sounds like rap music my friends would make as a joke.The biggest load of ... though is that this somehow represents the ""alienated voice of the brittish youth."" No, it represents the bratty, untalented voice of one brittish youth, and those who swallow his ... with this justification are being pretentious, trite, and cliched, not to mention they have no knowledge or respect for rap as a genre."
2,"Beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life down here!","Not to be overtly critical, and I know writing isn't easy, but did this author ever actually read the Holmes cannon? As I have noted in other reviews, you can disguise the man, the voice, take an alias, change to some exotic locale, but you can never lose focus that this is Sherlock Holmes you are writing about, and that means observation and deduction. This book paints a pretty background, but the main character is very out of place in it. The Holmes of this book could have never visited forbidden Tibet, because his bumbling would have given him away. And that's not the Holmes I have grown to appreciate. If you want to read about Holmes in Tibet, I suggest The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes or its alternate hardcover Sherlock Holmes: The Missing Years. Better written, better book. Quoth the Raven..."
1,No Range,"I bought two of these from [...]. Operating range is about six feet. At that, it's grainy and very hard to make out anything. Past 8 feet loses signal entirely. Totally worthless. I ended up taping the camera to the receiver. Even then, it's pretty useless. Don't waste your money. By the way, they were $[...] on [...]."
4,A Realistic Review,"In reading this book, I remembered a lot of things that I knew as a child. For somewhat spiritual reasons, I changed my thinking while blossoming into an adult. The writer does take on a christian viewpoint, which can be supremely helpful for those who believe in that. However, because it is based on common sense and truth, the information provided can be used by anyone. This book outlines a realistic approach to distinguishing the warning signs of the types of people we'd all like to avoid."
4,Should be required reading,"Want to find out why some relationships never feel good? This book tells what makes a quality relationship, and why people need safe people. Not only does the book help you see how other people are flawed, it also helps you see how you can be a better friend/spouse/partner. Very clear and easy to read."
1,This is a religious text.,"I found it impossible to focus on the advice offered in the book, because it is buried beneath countless references to God, Jesus and the Bible. Nowhere in the Amazon description or Editorial Review did it mention it was religiously based. It's distracting to the point of being obnoxious, and I would love to get my money back. What a waste."
5,Pastor,"This is a excellent publication for insight into self and others, you will have a more understanding ear."
2,Not Very Helpful,"This book wasn't very helpful for me. The focus seemed to be on getting involved in groups and talking to people about your problems. And while you're meeting with the groups, you're supposed to be real by letting everyone know what about them bothers you. That means you're being a safe person. A lot of their examples just seemed like ""whiney"" people who need a lot of coddling."
3,"Boundaries, Townsend, Cloud","I really like the information that these authors have to share BUT each book contains Bible quotesand refers to God constantly! I am not Catholic or Christian and I find the Bible info andGod references offensive and distract me from learning the material. I can appreciate faith,but if I wanted to know the Bible I would read IT. I want boundary info NOT BIBLE or GOD!"
5,Great book for anyone.,"I found this to be an extremely insightful book. It helps you to recoginize unsafe character traits in others so that you can avoid hurtful relationship. It will also reveal your own unsafe traits so that you can work on changing yourself. A must read if you find yourself going from bad relationship to bad relationship, or you can't seem to find friends that you can trust or confide in."
3,"valuable insights, but presented arrogantly","The authors present their observations about behaviors of people, which seem to be pretty insightful. However, they tend to classify people in to groups to be looked down upon, people that have the behaviors that they spell out in their book. For Christian authors they seem to think that they're above a lot of people, instead of in the same boat as the rest of us. They could use a little humility.They call certain people's behavior that they've personally counseled ""crazy!"" and say that they ""feel sorry for"" people they know personally that are not as socially adjusted as they perceive themselves to be. If you can get past the egos, the book does have some valuable information, mixed in with a lot of common sense."
2,Could not finish the book,"This book was a reiteration of commonly known facts of relationships. I skimmed the chapters because reading each one was incredibly boring.Not worth the money, wish I had checked it out from the library instead of buying."
4,"...and how to be a ""Safe Person"" to others...","I agree with another reviewer who stated that there is a great deal of responsibility placed on the ""victim"" on dealing with unsafe people and trying to be ""long-suffering"". I do believe that there is a time when a person must realize that someone is not ""safe"" for them and it's time to walk away...and hope that the other person will eventually change.The primary purpose for my higher rating, however, is that the book actually helped me to realize where I was ""unsafe"" for others, and I was able to understand how to become a safe person for others and how to let people know my expectations of them in reagrds to their ""being a safe person to me"".I think ""unsafe"" people will find this book just as useful as those who are seeking safe relationships. Of course, that is provided that the unsafe people have an open mind and are willing to change...which, sadly, they often are not. :-/"
3,"Gread common sense advice, far too much dependency on religion",This book could be outstanding but one has to wade through far too much religious context to get to the fundamentals associated with how to choose a heathy relationship.
1,bad material,"the material is rough and itchy. they are very tight on my hands. they also smelled bad, and the smell did not completely go away after washing. not at all like the nice stretchy gloves i got at Target which i was expecting these to be similar to."
4,Men's Magic Gloves-Black Large W27S34B,"Dear Glove Lovers;These are great gloves for the dollar value. They are; however, really not ""man"" hand size, at least not my large hands, but are for medium/smallish hands. They do stretch, but to their life detriment! The quality is great and I gave these to my Mom, who loves them! If your Mom needs a pair, get them now!lja/JMJ"
4,Pretty good So Far,"I just got these today, and it seems pretty good. The material isn't that rough (like wool), and it keeps my hands warm enough. But then of course, I bought these, just so I didn't have to spend money on the electric bill, turning on the heater. Not sure how well they'll fair on the outside. I'll try them out tonight."
3,Not my favorite Kresley Cole novel,"I adore Kresley Cole and her Immortals After Dark series, so I thought I would give one of her other series a try. I found the first half of the book tiresome. The female and male protagonists were not likeable. Their beyond stubborn natures were frustrating after 100+ pages. It seemed the characters completely morphed into new people for the second half of the book. Although the novel was not my favorite I am still huge fan of Ms. Cole and look forward to her next project."
4,"SEXY, SCOTTISH LOVE STORY - WORTH THE READ!!","I purchased the entire MacCarrick Brothers Trilogy at once and enjoyed all three of them. I love all things Scottish so I knew the brothers' brogue and warrior, ""caveman"" ways would be a fun read. This and the other two in the series are about men who like to take charge. VERY SEXY & STEAMY!! Of course each brother believes that he has a curse on him so they have lived as mercenaries and without wives or children. They fight falling in love with the women they ultimately fall in love with. I won't reveal the entire story line, but I totally recommend ""If You Dare"", and the other two books in the trilogy."
4,Sexy Scottish Brogue?,"""If you dare"" is such an interesting book...somewhat different from my usual style but I trusted the author and decided to try it out...and wasn't disappointed!The Scot, McCarrick initially appears to be a borish, somewhat uninspired mercenary with a one track mind (money). But with time, it seems there's more to him than meets the eye. He is a tortured soul, cursed not to find love in his lifetime. He is therefore wary when he starts having feelings for Annalia. Again, one of those male machismo books....McCarrick is not too different from other heroes in romance novels.Kudos to Kresley for this rather entertaining book. She managed to do the unthinkable: make scottish brogue sexy!"
4,GOOD READ,This is my first Kresley Cole book and won't be my last. I liked the tension between the main characters and I even like the small side story of her brother and his own little romance. Had REALLY HOT love scenes. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series.
3,Tried too hard,"*spoilers*Okay, the writing was decent, and it actually had a plot outside the bedroom. And I was really liking the tension for a while. Buuuuuuuut, I feel like the author tried too hard. I mean, a hero under a curse, a heroine with Mother issues, a Bad Guy who wants to marry the heroine because of her lineage, a brother in trouble, and various minor characters with a myriad of other issues and agendas (seriously, why was Olivia and her story necessary?). But in spite of all that, my main issue is the relationship between Anna and Court.Anna, ""Oh, I want him but don't want to be like my mother so instead I'll be insanely unreasonably mean, almost get us both killed, then change my mind and repeatedly try to seduce him until he gives in, then wonder why he won't marry me!""Bottom line: Again, the writing was fine. The love scenes are fine. I just dislike books where too much focus is on why the couple can't be together, and not the relationship itself."
5,Loved it!!,"The first Kresley Cole I ever read was Kiss Of The Demon King. Loved it so much I read all her paranormals. Once finished I went digging for more and found this little gem. Kresley's writing is exciting with a wonderful blend of solid story telling, juicy romance and action to make this book excellent. I also like how her story lines are interwoven into other books. I'm always looking forward to new reads from her."
5,Excellent romance!,"I enjoy reading about the hot blooded scottish and this is very well written. Good plot, good mix of action, romance and lust!"
4,3 1/2 stars for insufferable heroine,"I absolutely LOVE Kresley Cole's writing style, but this one drifted a bit from her norm. I have rated her other two novels with 5 stars across the board, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. I had a hard time liking Annalia even towards the end. Court, however, was everything you would want in a romance hero. I don't know how Court could have fallen in love with such a shrew, but he did and madly at that.What saved this book from being 2 or 3 stars was the magnetic sexual tension and the actual sex scenes. KC is unrivalled, imo for writing steamy, expicit, yet tasteful love scenes. It borders on erotic but not as ""clinical"" as a Thea Devine or Robin Schone novel. There's discriptive sex and then there's *descriptive* sex.If this is your first Kresley Cole book and you didn't enjoy it, I highly suggest her other two: ""Captain of All Pleasures"" and ""The Price of Pleasure"" for a very satisfying read."
5,Steamy Romance,"If you like historical romance you will like this novel. Court's desire for Annalia is almost immediate, although she thinks Court is a brute. But once the steamy sexual desire for each other starts the story really ramps up. The story is good, interesting and accurate historically. I liked it, and I read tons of historical and paranormal romance. I've read all of Kresley's books; this is one of my favorites, it's not boring. I like the personalities of the characters. In my opinion I would recommend it."
2,No thanks,This hero had only one thing on his mind. The heroine was quite strong but the overpowering and lustful sex ruined a potentially good story.
1,cannot believe this rubbish is getting good reviews,I usually like Kresley Cole's writing but this is really bad! The heroine is completely unlikeable and there's zero chemistry with the leading man. The story is stupid & the ending predictable. This is a huge disappointment for a good writer. Don't waste your money.
5,Hot and sexy,"Kresley Cole is a favorite author of mine, her books are hard to put down once I've started. The book arrived quickly and in great condition."
2,"All Sexual Tension, No Story","Plenty of sexual longing and consummation if that's what you want, but not have enough story or character development to keep it interesting."
1,WoW,The product came in no good. Broken no good cane use the product that i bought brand NEW!!!!! But came in broken and no good cant play with it. I spent 80 plus dollars for a product for my family to use but it came in no good and cant play with it wow !!!! thank you alot for nothing!
2,did not change my life,"Full disclosure: I had never heard of Paul Goodman before I watched this documentary. I was attracted to the photogenic portrait on the front cover and the catchy title.Based on the title I was expecting to learn about the man's philosophy and his revolutionary ideas. I wanted to be convinced that I should read some of his books. I was disappointed... Instead we hear about his over-sized sweaters, baggy pants, and short-lived romances. Why do I care what clothes he wore or who he had sex with? Why do 20 different ""family friends"" need to tell us about his personal life?The entire DVD is just anecdotes from friends/family spliced with a single interview on ""Firing Line"".Apparently he was a poet, anarchist, psychologist, pacifist, and openly gay. Beyond those single word descriptions I can't say I learned anything about the man."
3,"Good Product, if Found..","I've been searching for months to find more cartridges for my NEC SuperScript 100C. Thankfully, they have arrived near the holidays."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful","Another great VHS of Shari Lewis, love this tape also. Another must have for your family."
4,Awsome Band,"This is the best band to come out of Lubbock. I have seen them 3 times live and have their cd, Telepathetic. The lyrics are moving and the music is somewhat reminicent of ""Live"". I'd definitely recommend it."
5,This band is amazing!,This CD makes you feel ever emotion on the spectrum. It is definitely a must buy!
2,AUTUMN LEAVES,"Although the music on the CD was soothing, it was not what I thought it would be based on the cover and the description. The music is very oriental in nature and didn't seem to have much to do with Autumn Leaves and sounds and feelings of the Fall. I was disappointed because of my expectations."
3,A fantasy story for a young child with fear of leaving home.,"This illustrated book uses the metaphor of a prince on a quest in a large forest. The young prince achieves a sense of mastery and discovers that the forest is not really as threatening as he had expected.This would be a good bedtime story for a preschool child who is having some concerns about goint to daycare, or starting any new activity. It does not directly address the reader about separation anxiety. For some children, the use of this type of indirect metaphorical approach works well. It is nice if the child can draw conclusions himself. However many children may also need the parents to talk about separation issues directly."
5,He's got it right,"Yancy really does a nice job with this book. It helped me understand Jesus in a way I could. I read the book The Politics of Jesus in a college class, and The Jesus I Never Knew is an easier read and in some way similar!"
5,This book explains how to love as Christ wants us to love!,"Find out the Scripture where the only physical description of Jesus resides! Explore the Jewishness of Jesus. Explore the ""androgenous"" Jesus. Learn Jesus' views on ""Free Will"". This is an excellent book if you want to know Christ Jesus more. After reading this book, you will be closer to Christ. This book deserves more than 5 stars."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This book has answered questions for me that no one, not even many ministers, have been able to answer for me. In my time of doubt, ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" has lifted me up. Mr. Yancy, thank you."
5,Who is Jesus?,"On the cover of my book is a banner that says, ""Voted Best Book of the Year!"" Now that ten years have passed since the original publication, perhaps it is time to proclaim, ""Best Book of the Decade!""This is the first book by Philip Yancey that I have read, but it won't be the last. I've read the New Testament many times, yet I had to keep asking myself, ""How could I have missed this?"" Using the four Gospels as his primary source, Yancey introduces us to Jesus as the original writers saw him.I am sorry to admit that the Jesus I knew was far too small. I am grateful to Yancey for sharing Christ in an honest and real way that has opened my eyes and caused me to see that he is far greater than I ever hoped or dared to believe."
5,this is one of the greatest books i have ever read..,this book is like a very great study your own self book. what i mean is if you thought you knew things like the beatitudes this book made me really look again and with a open mind and heart go back and look and really study the LORD's sermom again like never ever before.I just can't put this book down I just read it again and again.I know Mr.Yancey did a lot of study and time to write this book and I for one am very gratefull he did put this book togather.It's a master piece.and shoud be read by every one.I for one thought I would never say this about any book.but this one is a great one. Thank You for your time .AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.....
5,A Superb Book !!,"I do not often read Christian books (other than the Bible), and I do not consider myself to be a conservative Christian. This is the first book that I have read by Yancey, and I am overwhelmed. He is a gifted writer, and his insights are remarkable. Chapter 6 on the Beatitudes is worth reading over and over; I would not hesitate to recommend the reading of this chapter to anyone, Christian or non-Christian. And I am going to recommend this book to everyone in my church (though I suspect that most have already read it)."
3,"Too busy, read What's So Amazing about Grace","I recognize that many of the reviews for Amazing about Grace state that it is too repetitive with The Jesus I Never Knew.Personally, although Mr. Yancey's style makes both reads enjoyable, this book covered a lot of ground and none of them thoroughly enough to be satisfactory. The other reviews are right, your hunger for God increases after reading this book. My theory is that this is because you are intrigued by all the paths it takes not because you were fed on any path. Choose what Mr. Yancey calls the one unique quality of Christianity, ""Grace"". What's So Amazing about Grace, covers much of the same ground but feeds you a full helping of views on Grace. Again, both books are good, but Grace is superior."
3,The best way to know Jesus.,The best way to know Jesus is in the Bible. It is already writen in the Old and New Testament. Research the Messianic prophecies. Also read Jesus's words in the gospels and revelation. The best way to know Jesus is to do the research yourself and not depend on what others may say or think.
2,Author needs to keep looking. He's not there yet.,"Here we go again. Another ""bright, intellectual"" who has forgotten the most important words of Jesus. ""God is a spirit and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."" If Mr. Yancey really wants to ""Know Jesus"" he must seek him with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. If he is dilligent, the ""true nature"" of Jesus will be revealed to him. The greatest and only book ever written to help us know and understand Jesus is the Holy Bible. It does not need this addendum by Mr. Yancey."
1,An historical account,"I would not neccessarily call this book ""Christian"". It is more of an historical account, Bible as literature type of book. It does make you think about different aspects of Jesus life, but most of that is speculation or perception. Yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end."
2,NOt so enlightening,"It appears that the author never gave a thought to the idea that the Jesus of modern day Christians was, in fact, a Jewish person, and not ""the first Christian."" That being said, the author's critical analysis leaves a lot to be desired. First of all the author is a Biblical Literalist and assumes every word to be a historical fact. That is unfortunate because he lacks the vision to see how the early church editorialized the life of this first century Jewish person into the ""mystical, magical, offspring of God"" character that we learn about in flannel-graph presentations in Sunday School. The person seriously looking into the life of the Jewish Person of Christ would be better served by reading The Rt. Rev. John S. Spong's book This Hebrew Lord.With the ""millennium"" on our doorstep it is likely that more books of this type will be published. For some it will be a revelation for others, like me, a not so terrific attempt to popularize what is already well known to many people."
1,Yancey Does Not Know the Jesus of the Bible,"Jesus Christ is Yahweh. Yancey doesn't understand that. God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. God NEVER changes. God is Holy Trinity. God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity. God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity. God now is Holy Trinity. When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity. God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World. Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament. Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally."
5,The Everyman's introduction to the real Jesus,"I found this book so very down to earth, geared toward a general audience in an honest, loving manner. It's not Buechner, no one is, and it's not Eldredge (""Beautiful Outlaw"") which is a study in poetic prose, but it reaches the heart and brings the humanity of our Savior to the reader in a palpable and meaningful way. I highly recommend it."
4,The YOuth Minister,"The book reminds me of the movie Pay it forward.Great look at the kingdom of God.Not for new Christians, but helps all Christians to take a step by step look at Jesus.check out my blog on this book[...]"
5,Best in its genre,"If you've been turned off by Christians but are attracted to the person of Jesus Christ, this is the ONE book to read"
5,Yancey's Jesus,"Philip Yancey makes even those who have spent years walking aside their Savior to question whether the Savior with whom they have been walking is the Jesus of Nazareth found in the Bible. Anyone who reads this book will realize and recognize that Christians have been taught to follow a Jesus who is different from the Jesus in the New Testament. Yancey also responds to some of the age old questions and arguments against a Resurrected, Living Lord. The Jesus that Yancey did not know is the Jesus that many do not know. If anyone wants to meet Jesus without the biases of critics and zealots, read _The Jesus I Never Knew_."
3,Commentary of Jesus,"I was slightly disappointed reading this book. Expecting to find out WHO Jesus was, I found a commentary of WHAT Jesus did. If you are after a COMMENTARY of Jesus' life, then this is the book, but don't expect more like I did"
2,"Cassette is abridged, not as insightful as the book.","I heard the book read over the radio and it said much more than the audio cassette. I felt that the title of the cassette should be ""The Jesus We've All Heard About."" I am going to order the book"
5,Wonderful! EXCELLENT!,One of the best books I've read in a long time! Puts Jesus in a whole new light...not a whimpy weak vulnerable man but our SAVIOR! our HERO! our SUPERMAN! I loved it and passed it on!
3,Easy read,"Nothing new to anyone who already spends time in God's word, expected more from Yancey. A bit long and slow."
5,Jesus as seen firsthand,"Here's a look at ""Jesus' life 'from below,' as a spectator, one of the many who followed him around,"" says Yancey.It's a journey well taken.I now notice all the preconceived notions and unwarranted assumptions we have about Jesus--especially having finished this book around Christmastime, with the ""little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes."" (Yet surely he had his share of swaddling cloth rash!)What if we didn't have the benefit of knowing Jesus through history's lens? How would we see him then? Who was the Jesus they knew?Yancey dives deeply, yet writes lightly. I found myself writing ""hmm,"" ""good question,"" and ""interesting perspective"" in the margins. Yancey has a rare way of making the profound digestible and understandable.I would say that this is a must-read. But (as Yancey would agree) the best way to see the true Jesus is through the Bible--in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Still, this makes a great companion.Well-worth reading."
5,Wow! Incredible book!,This guy can write! I highly recommend this book to believers and non-believers alike. Cuts right to core of who Jesus is and Yancey is refreshingly honest about himself and Christianity. Changed the way I see Jesus and myself.
5,helped me to remember what it really means to follow Christ,"after reading this book I started to feel more compassion towards the drunkards, drug addicts, the homeless, people who are seen as ""social disease""or ""social outcasts"" after all Jesus did not came to find the ""self righteous""but He came to find the lost and heal their wounds. Working in the ER i'm always exposed to these lost souls and one cannot help but feel burned out and frustrated especially when you have that worldly mentality that this is survival of the fittest, if you can't cope then too bad, stop wasting our hard-earned taxes but now i start to see them as how Jesus sees them. No, i'm not condoning any type of addiction, co-dependency or laziness but now i am less judgemental and realize that God loves all His children and wants to share His love and forgiveness and i am no better than any of them"
4,The Jesus I never knew,"Classic Yancy. He starts building a foundation and by the end he has you wishing there was more book. Analogies are outstanding and the insight into possible reasons for Jesus' actions are intriguing. This is the third book I have read by Phillip Yancy, and I really enjoy his expanded view he gives on a subject. I read this book after his title ""What so amazing about Grace"". I think Yancy has a deep understanding about the things of God. I would recommend this book to anyone. I also think it would be a great group study source."
3,The Quest for the Pseudo-Historical Jesus,"This book is basically what the quest for the historical Jesus looks like when done by a non-scholar within the bounds of evangelical Christianity. I think Yancey is genuinely interested in discovering what Jesus was really like, but there are some lines he won't cross to find out.Yancey does manage to clear away a lot of the pious rubble that typically hides Jesus, but in the end he still comes away with a very Christian Jesus (i.e. not Jewish). Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking Yancey to go the route of the Jesus Seminar, but if you want to really explore who Jesus was, consider N.T. Wright instead of Yancey as a guide.Beyond that it seems like Yancey runs out of things to say about two thirds of the way through the book and rather than quit he keeps rehashing the same song and dance. ""I would have expected the Son of God to assert his power, but Jesus came in weakness."" This is certainly true, and very important. But you can only say it so many ways."
5,Reminisce and learn from Jesus...,"I have to admit that i have not read with so much attention the gospels on Jesus' life since I was a little child. But to understand Yancey's point of view is to re-imagine how was Jesus' stay on Earth and at the same time think of him in a human manner. By doind that, you can identify a whole lot more with him, and even try to be like him (as crazy as it may sound). Definitely worthy to have...."
5,a classic shoegazing experience,"This is one helluva psychedelic trip. All Loop records are great but this is my favorite. Head On, Burning World, Deep Hit; I get chills just from the song titles. Loop deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as The Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Suicide (they do an excellant cover of Rocket USA here), The Velvet Underground (ie. Waiting for My Man), The Jesus and Mary Chain and Spacemen 3. Would somebody (Mute perhaps?) re-release these (Loop) records please! They deserve to be in print. And Loop deserve a place in the underground hall of fame."
1,UTTER GARBAGE,"Truly the most boring and brainless film in a long time. Terrible script. When they ran out of ideas ,they just put in another torture and killing to pad out the film. Predictable and don't believe the dvd sleeve which states that it is loaded with nudity. There is none except for an occassional backside view. Funny how no one at the University notices that so many students go missing."
3,So bad it was good...,"When you watch a movie titled ""Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island,"" you don't expect an Oscar winning film. You're hoping for fun, silly trash. Well, that's what I feel like my friends and I got when we watched this movie at a GLBT film festival many years back. We had a good time. Sometimes we still talk about how the old woman in the movie would not call the police to report the killer because they might cut the funding at the mental hospital. This movie is funny. It's definitely not as good as Hellbent, but it is fun."
1,Huge waste of money and time! Horrible.,"I bought this movie because I thought it would be a lot of fun and the premise to the movie and cover art work was promising. Well, boy was I fooled. The movie fails to be a comedy horror and fails to be a scary horror movie- it just fails all the way around. The acting is really bad and the movie doesn't really go anywhere. The direction is not good either. It's very slow moving and near the end you will find yourself fast forwarding to get through the rest of it. I really should have rented this one before buying it because this was a gigantic waste of money. 1/5"
4,"Incredible movie, every frame is interesting on many levels","This is a great and amazing story. Just the fact that Proenneke accompolished his goal of forging a life in the wilderness is amazing and fascinating. But watching him do it is really a treat. The cinematography is spectacular, and even more so when you think that he shot this by himself on cameras he back-packed in, in color, in 1968!! And to tell the truth, what we see him do would be hard to believe- if we weren't watching him do it.Whether it's Alaska's vistas, Proenneke's series of astonishing accomplishments, the wildlife of Twin Lakes, or the fact that this was filmed in 68 and looks so good, Every frame is worth watching a few times. There's so much packed into this movie, that it's kind of amazing in itself."
5,Incredible Story!,"Alone in the Wilderness was a PBS special that won the hearts of our family. The story is an unbelievable one that had our jaws dropping most of the time. What this man accomplished by himself, building a log cabin by hand with no help and so precisely, was truly astonishing. This story is funny, heartwarming and a must have for anyone who loves the outdoors!"
3,Book,I wasn't too impressed. I felt there was too much scripture mixed in with the message which didn't necessarily help to make the point.
3,"Interesting, but does not suggest change","This is an interesting theory that people who are lacking emotionally fail in one of four areas: bonding, boundaries, ability to accept and exert authority, and ability to discern right from wrong. What's missing from the book are ways to remedy the lack in each of these ""growth areas."" In addition, what the book doesn't seem to acknowledge is that bonding and boundaries (and perhaps the other two areas, as well) are tightly coupled, so that if a person were difficient in one, he would probably be in the others, as well. I like his analysis, but would have preferred suggestions for how to take care of those areas that are lacking."
4,Pleased,"I was very excited to receive the book! And it arrived in good time. I was a little disappointed because when I received it, it was an older edition (the cover was an older edition). Otherwise, it was good!"
3,Good book,"Love Henry Cloud. Very challenging to interact with and solid thinker. This book is a surface scratch of his theology. Good book, but a little light."
3,Incredible and terrible,"There are few books out there that play on the borders of both worthlessness and pricelessness. This is one of them.Cloud brings out life-changing principles in his analysis of boundaries, bonding, good and evil, and adulthood. It has the potential of completely revamping your view of healthy interaction with others (and God).At the same time, it is very poorly written. I found it to be unstructured, long-winded, and completely unengaging in many places. Moreover, there is frequent misuse of scripture and a number of statements that could be taken to horribly unhealthy extremes.Read the book. Be changed, but be wary."
4,Changes that heal,"Although, it has been fine. I wasn't aware that it was a 'pocket size,'paperback when I bought. Though that hasn't affected me much."
3,Good book,"I didn't expect this book to be so religious, yet it is an interesting read. I haven't read the entire book so I cannot give a complete review. I do think it can be helpful for individuals who have experienced spiritual abuse."
3,Read it twice then you'll GET it !,If you have a short attn span like me it might be a little borring or tough to take in.After discussing it with a group at Church it starts to sink in and reading over important parts again really helped.
4,A Wonderful Integrative Theological and Pscyhological Book,"As I have read this book (Indonesian translation), I found that Henry Cloud is really able to integrate Christian theology and psychology in giving practical yet profound answers in regard to a deep human problem. The book has been one of great resources in my preaching and counseling ministry."
5,Great book,"This book is easy to understand and offers concrete examples at the beginning of each chapter. I could identify with several of the examples and it made me really think about how I wanted to live my life. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to reconcile their past hurts and relationships so that they can have a future filled with solid, healthy relationships."
4,Life Changing,"This book while truly help you undertand and heal from your past. I also bought the workbook, as you gain so much more by going through the workbook with the book. I definitely recommend this book."
4,Interesting concepts,This book gives me a new slant at thinking about critical issues in life. I am reading it a little at a time so that I can absorb the content.
5,"Changes That Heal, paperback","The four main points of this book can help any person understand more who they are and how they relate to others. Bonding, how to say ""no"", learning that people are neither all good nor all bad are points that Dr. Henry Cloud explains in a biblical and tangible way. The book is well-written, broken up in understandable sections and gives you something to think about at every turn. The author pulls from many people's life experiences and there are many examples of everyday people that you can relate to. You will find examples that help you understand the points he is trying to point out. This book is a must read.There is a work book which goes along with the book, but Changes That Heal stands alone or can be enhanced by the workbook."
4,Changes That Heal,"An excellent book that I really wanted; as it is an older, yellowed paperback, but otherwise good condition, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I started reading it immediately, and know that I will read it & reference it again. It arrived faster than I expected."
3,"Interesting, but NOT the Bible as a novel.","The Book of God is, as many others have stated, an interesting read and good for the sake of bringing some to read biblical acocunts in a nonthreatening manner. However, I was disappointed in the book due to its claim of being ""The Bible as a Novel."" This, it is not. Many important biblical stories are left out. Others are embellished upon to an odd degree. (Case in point: Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist.) Still others are briefly mentioned and are told almost right from the bible, with no embellishments or modern language to ease the reading. Why the author felt free to add to some stories and not others is puzzling to me, as well as his leaving out some of the more well known biblical references.I'd recommend this book as one to read if you would like more understanding of biblical stories and references. Just be aware going in to it that it is not all biblical fact - read the bible along with it!!"
5,Love this for personal insight into biblical characters!,I had this book years ago and believe me it is still relevent! Timeless! A nice read with insight and perspective
2,The Book of God,The Book arrived in good condition and my dislike had nothing to do with Amazon. I just did not particularly like the content of the book but needed it for a class. I personally cannot recommend it to others but they might see it differently than I did. For a used book it was in good shape. No problems with that.
3,Good Overview,This was a good read but it is a novel not a substitute for the Bible. What more can I say?
5,Great book,I have this book in hard cover and now after my brain surgery I am having trouble seeing so I am glad to have found it on the Kindle Fire. It is a large book so it took a whild to down load. Had to have a full battery.
5,So Easy to Read,"I am really learning alot about the Bible from this book. It is so much easier to read and really gives you an inside look at the people. I suggest it to anyone who wants to read the Bible, but like me, can't get past the begats and confusion that begins in Genesis. It is very interesting."
4,It's worth reading.,"I don't know about you, but I would get confused everytime I tried to read the bible since it was not in chronilogical order. I would flip around so I could read it, but then I would come across something else I did not know about to help in understanding a situation or even a person. This book helped. It also has a bible study guide with it. I am now ordering another copy because this was a friends and I have put some wear on it. I am also recommending this to another friend so we can bible study it together. This book is time consuming but definately worth reading and investing the time in learning the bible better."
4,Loved it!,"I absolutely loved this book! It was easy to read and I really appreciated the approach of looking at the bible as a novel, adding in details to characters and plot. You get sucked into the characters and story, I couldn't put it down. This book has been lent out to several family members and everyone loves it."
5,The Most Important Book of Our Generation,"The Book of God is a book that everyone who has an interest in Scripture should read. Wangerin brings the Bible narrative to life with astonishing clarity and intensity. The characters of the Bible become people we know and love. Without comprimising the integrity of the Bible, Wangerin has produced a version of the Scripture that everyone from the layman to the theologian can relate to. In an age when people have begun to wonder about the relevance of Scripture and Christianity, Wangerin reminds us that Christianity's Holy Book is not merely an account of things past but a living part of our lives. A must read."
4,"great book, wish condition had been better","Presenting a meaningful, flowing version of the stories of the bible, this book provides color and reality to characters and events.The condition of the used edition purchased was less than advertised."
5,Wonderful Entry to the Biblical Story,"My wife and I love this book. It is well written and helps portray biblical events in a wonderfully modern novel style. His descriptions are beautiful and vivid, and the book is accessible to everyone with a fifth grade reading level.Great for people who are intimidated by the Bible but want to know its key stories."
5,This book has it all!,"This book has it all - even a foreword by Stephen Sondheim. Songs like 'Can That Boy Foxtrot!,' 'Uptown, Downtown,' and 'The Road You Didn't Take,' all in standard piano/vocal/guitar notation."
2,The MITO wins over all others,"July 2006. After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down. The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close. My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation. In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep. Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry."
1,very cheap but didn't work very well,"i purchased this for my husband as he usually hooks his ipod up through a tape connector in his car. i have seen others work nicely but this one required some finangling to get it to play through the right station and once you got it there, it only lasted a minute or two. if purchasing again, i would shell out the money and buy the real deal."
2,Small package,"Used this in four different vehicles and quality of the sound varies. The larger the car, the more static occurs. Sound quality is middle of the road. If you demand high quality sound, get a direct line system. If you want to listen to podcasts, this will work work well in small cars.As you travel, station interference requires resetting the frequency. It means you have to shut off, unplug the transmitter, shut the ipod off (again), find an open station, and replug the transmitter.Pros: Size, absence of wires snaking across the car, 2 memory presets, price.Cons: Sound quality, draws power down from ipod."
2,not powerfuol enough,"This is the weakest fm adapter I used. (of 3 or 4 similar products) It's really sleek and easy to use but there is just not enough power to get a clear signal. Also, there's no volume control from the ipod end when the transmitter is plugged in."
3,weak!,"I live near NYC, so open stations are difficult to find. However, even when found this transmitter was weak and needed to be in close proxcimity to the reciever and not moved, otherwise static. When a good station was tuned in the sound quality was marginal."
2,Works right by the radio receiver,"This works well at home, near the radio in which it will be used. On the road, in my city of 200,000, it loses the signal a lot and has a lot of static. It must be held near the radio somehow to work in the car.For home use, this is worthwhile."
4,Purchase only based on where you live,"I read a ton of reviews before buying the Kensington Pico FM Transmitter. Bottom line is that its performance depends on where you use it. I live just outside of NYC and it is really hard to find a station with no interference. However, the transmitter works good when I go on trips to places where you can't get too many stations on the radio."
1,"Looks cool, Doesnt work.","Awesome design, but i just cant get rid of the white noise in my car. And whats the use of an FM transmiter if you cant hear your music clearly?!"
3,"Decent, but not great","It eats the battery (I should have gone with a powered transmitter, and likely will buy one in the future), but it works. As a result, it does not transmit the signal strongly to the selected channel (which means you have to keep it almost on top of the antenna source), and if it does, it is not as pure as others I have seen and tried. But for the price, it is a good item."
4,About as good as you'll get (self powered) for the newer ipods,"If you need a unit-powered FM device, you're stuck with this one. Luckily you'll be stuck with a pretty decent unit.Not as loud or as powerful as the Griffin iTrip, but unlike the iTrip this thing will actually turn on every single time you play a song. I don't know about your requirements, but that is a pretty big one for me.It's small as all heck. I can even fit it in my ipod's case with it's headphones. Pretty cool deal, I like that aspect of it.It's naturally not as good as Kensington's powered FM Transmitter, but it gets the job done when it needs to. I took away a star because it's not as powerful as it could be, but again, when it comes to ipod-powered FM transmitters you'll do no better than this little guy right here."
3,OK product - OK Price,"I've been using the Kensington Pico FM transmitter for a couple of months, It works great at close distances but fails to deliver the quality of sound I expected. Another minus is that you are not able to use the FM transmitter and charge the Ipod at the same time."
1,no luck with this one,"I could get it to work, but the sound quality was very poor. This is the second type of FM transmitter I have tried - the search is on again I guess. I suppose with these things it is trial and error until you find one that works. I liked the fact that you could use this one with any radio, not just in the car, but I may have to resort to the ""car only"" type. If all I can hear is static, forget it."
2,Topper does not really top the list,This topper is not super effective for people with back problems if you don't have a flat bed with a firm mattress on it. I think I would still invest in a memory foam mattress instead of just the topper in future. The price is good though.
1,Just Terrible,"It packs to tightly, so you simply can't get it either (a) expand to the width and length of a king size bed, or (b) expand so it gives you the 1.5 inch it claims."
1,foam matrress purchased,"I was totally dissatisfied with this product and have returned it for a refund. It never regained it's shape and was flat in some places, bigger in others and a disaster."
5,101 Bight Bulletin Board Ideas,"This is a great resource book for any classroom teacher! I found it very helpful. I have used many of their ideas. Very easy to understand the concept of each bulletin board described. I recommend this book to anyone who needs creative,theme-related bulletin board ideas."
1,Misleading,"This product was entirely religiously themed, and that was not what I intended to order. I would not have ordered this product, if I had known that it was themed to religion. It is completely useless to use in my classroom and a complete waste of money."
4,Just in the Nick of Time,I place a new preschool children's BB every month celebrating birthdays. This was detailed and gave me some new theme and element ideas.
4,Shotshell humidor,"Overall a good product. I bought 3 of these as gifts and all but one came damaged from manufacturer. Nothing too serious but never theless. the other 2 products are really nice and it was hit with the people they were given to. holds about 8-9 torpedo or like cigars. it is a bit heavy due to it having the brass cap, but its still a cool humidor for the price $30."
4,"Thickening, thickening.","I've been a Covenant follower since the beginning, and one of the things that always drew me from album to album was the progression of the sound. While I'd tend to agree that this album lacks some of the standards of old, I can't claim it's not up to standard. Turn off all other sources of white noise in your listening area - some of the sound changeups are superbly subtle, even in the high BPM cuts like Call the Ships to Port. Of the lot, the song I become most absorbed in has got to be Bullet. Voice and sound form music here so supremely balanced, I'm momentarily startled when the song is over.I'll keep going back to older albums, especially focusing on songs like 2D, Helicopter, and Norman Bates (I can't breathe!), where the focus is perhaps tighter - but the sound, I'd swear instrument feeds are being used to modify vocals and vice versa. Lost, I'm lost - and at the end of Bullet I'm suddenly alone in the dark, looking for the light switch."
3,EBM PULSATORS FROZEN>>>>,"This cd is a good cd, but not excellent. I am a fan of Covenant, but this cd isn't one of their better ones, how ever it does contain a some important gems. Covenant is like Blondie in the respect that they do try new things, but this time around they don't seem as into it as usual. You can tell the songs they put their all into, and you can tell the songs they really weren't interested in themselves.The cover is haunting and one of the best EBM covers ever for a cd. A man frozen in a chair! This cd contians 4 really great important songs along with so-so songs. ""Monochrome"" starts out monotone and pulsing and grows to thunderous passion by the end of the song. ""Call The Ships To Port"" is perhaps my favorite of all Covenant songs. The synths wail in the background, the lyrics are haunting, and the bass throbs. ""Bullet"" is just pure EBM passion.""We Stand Alone"" is just a haunting danceable song. Would I buy this cd? Yes, even though it is uneven."
3,Indications of the future?,"If ""Call The Ships to Port"" is an indicator of where Covenant are going in the future with regards to their music, then that is a good thing. Their earlier albums, Seqencer and Cryotank, are not really EBM at all, but more of 'Industrial Lite' at a high speed. Northern Light is a smoother offering, yet still managing to deliver heavy beats. The previously near-absent melodies in Covenants earlier work are here in abundance, resulting in a result not unlike Funker Vogt, in how they manage to use strong melodies in hard music.My only real complaint is that the CD only has a few tracks like this. Many of the other tracks are either ballads (and the only one I liked was ""Bullet"") or not particularly complex melodically.Covenant obviously are very talented yet their best work is scattered throughout its career, padded with filler."
2,Spend your money on their previous albums instead.,"When I listened to this CD I almost felt embarassed for Covenant. Unlike their previous hard sounding albums, this one was way too slow and the lyrics were cheesy. There was NOT ONE song on this album that would justify purchasing it. Get their previous albums instead - these guys really were good once."
2,This CD [is bad].,"Covenant is a good band. A good *techno* band, that is. This CD moves away from what makes them a good band, by focusing on their HORRIBLE singing. Lyrical content is at a high, making it EVEN WORSE. Definately pass this one up, and go buy their EBM masterpiece, United States of Mind."
4,Hurray for Monochrome,"Northern Light (note: no ""S"") is far better than United States of Mind. USM had a whole bunch of okay songs, but none that were great. Northern Light, however, holds Covenant's three best songs to date: Monochrome, Call the Ships to Port, and We Stand Alone. Monochrome is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately it's the first track, so it sets the bar a little high for the rest of the album. Every song is good, although most are a little slower than one might prefer. I do wish there were a couple more high-energy tracks like the first two, but overall, it's a great aural experience. Even if the rest of the album sucked, which it doesn't, it's worth the price for Monochrome alone. Granted, I happen to love the newer direction of APB, VNV, et al, and am not a huge fan of the older growly industrial stomp. Some of these tracks even have an Underworld flair. I am very relieved after being pretty darn unaffected by United States of Mind."
5,the best,"This is the best album of Covenant, even people might say it was a commercial attempt because they were on a major label , this album is a classic , no doubt"
4,I dig it,"I forgot how i heard about this group but when I first gave this a try I instantly liked it because it does have a depeche mode sound that I love, check it out G."
4,Northern Light,"A solid, quality follow-up album from the guys from Sweden but alittle lacking in comparison to United States of Mind which in my estimation is chock fulled w/great songs. Still I would recommend buying Northern Light if you are in fact a fan of the EBM, Industrial movement. ""Call the ships to port"" is probably the best tune on the disc and I suggest cranking it once you buy it."
2,I'm watching the DVD and wanted to buy this for my mom,"Unfortunately, my mother does not have the expertise on computers to understand the fix for the problem. I am going to have to buy her the DVD and specify to her to not purchase the CD. I can't believe that this is a known problem that you can get a settlement check for if you file it by the end of next month, yet these CDs are still being sold with this broken content!"
2,Great CD - Gift but Copy protection yields poor playback,"I rated this CD 2 stars due to defects caused by the copy-protection not because of the content. I gave this CD as a gift. The music was appreciated, but the recording contained defects. I need to get this CD exchanged. In spite of the defects, the CD is very good. I recommend a noncopy-protected version. Sony needs to know that it is the price of CDs that is encouraging piracy not the alternative recording media."
4,Japanese Tecno at it's best,"Globe has been one of Japan's most popular bands since the late 90's. The album Lights includes the number one tecno hit ""Try this Shoot.""Song list:Many Classic MomentsMerry Go RoundWhat's the Justice?Genesis of NextCome Into ExistenceMegamiTry this ShootStop! In the Name of LoveLights Brought the FutureFade in2"
5,Good DVD,"I gave this as a gift to my parents and they loved it. No complaints. They enjoy reminiscing and really loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans so they get a real kick out of getting to see these shows again in their entirety, just the way they were back so many years ago. There are several shows included so they don't have to watch it all at once but can watch several espisodes, or just one. It made a great gift for them."
5,"Please, please come out with another album!","I have been awaiting either another album from The Hal Lovejoy Circus, or to be able to see them live. This album really does it for me. From ""Hot Pants"" to ""Size 7 Sneakers"", their love of Kansas City really shows through. Recommended for anyone who likes novelty and/or poppy rock songs (or hot pants!)"
2,Cliche Piled Upon Cliche,"I was looking forward to this read but if it had not been for the fact that I took it on an international flight, it is unlikely that I would have got more than 50 or so pages into it before giving up. All the characters are terribly stereo-typed, the racist military pilot, the inscrutable Chinese ""taikonaut"" and the honour-obsessed Japanese. None of these characters ring true and the others are equally over the top cliches. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong to the nth degree until it all becomes absurd and stupid. Then there are the ridiculous coincidences that beggar belief and completely ruin any hope of a useful conclusion. I loved The Changling Plague and Technogenesis but this is very disappointing."
3,"Great premise, but...","...unfortunately the writing falls a bit short.The characters were rather cartoonish, and the dialogue was juvenile.Spend a few hours with this book and enjoy it for what it is worth, just don't expect too much."
3,disappointed,"If you are a super-scholar who likes to do word puzzles, you mike like trying to piece together some of the many fragments of the pseudo-psalms found in this book. I was very excited to buy it because I thought it would give me greater exposure to ancient Hebrew and Aramaic. But there is not much content. There are a few psalms (e.g. 154 & 155), part of an addition to Sirach and not much more.I had some money to spend, but I wish I had not spent it on this.Nevertheless, for the right person, I am sure it would be worth it. After all, it is certainly not the publishers fault that there are not many pseudepigraphic and non-Masoretic Psalms to publish. It would have been nice, though, if they published the actual psalms and texts of the Bible from Qumran so that one could compare them with the Masoretic Text- or at least if they published the Rule of the Community, etc. all in one volume."
4,Reasonable collection of odds and ends,"There are a few very solid, tight, classic Nomeansno assaults on this album, like ""Red on Red"" and ""Blinding Light"" (dealing with religious fanaticism and warfare); but they're equally balanced with oddities and outtakes that are sometimes rather surprising, like the blackly playful piano jaunty, ""More ICBMS,"" the bluesy acoustic ""I'm doing well,"" a version of ""Real Love"" by Scott Henderson and Swell Prod., and, most memorably, a take on the Kinks' ""Victoria"" by the Hanson Bros, with lyrics rewritten as a mocking jab at the Wright brothers hometown -- probably one of the funnier moments on any Nomeansno disc. Some of the earlier pieces aren't quite as engaging, but all in all this is a decent collection of songs otherwise unavailable by Nomeansno and won't disappoint any fan. ""Widget"" is fun, too. The world needs more songs about widgets."
5,Own all Mermaid films for one low price,"My favorite Little Mermaid movie was only the original 1989 release, but if the little ones in your household cannot get enough of her then buying this set saves money than getting all 3 movies seperately.It is also a great buy for the hardcore Disney fans young and old alike.It includes a trio of sealed (have not opened mine) mini lithographs depicting a scene/theme from each movie: The Little Mermaid, The Little Mermaid Ariel's Beginning and The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea."
5,My daughter Loves it.,We have watched all 3 of the movies in the last 4 days and not only once several times. She is in love with the little Mermaid and all of the excitement that is included in the movies.
4,still great,"i hesitated on buying this or seeing the last one, sure it couldn't be as good as the others. But I was glad to be wrong, the final/first story IS was well done as the other two. I'm well over 21 and still enjoy this set very much, kids love it too!"
2,Characters flatter than day-old beer,"This was a truly lousy book. I was attracted to it by the fact that Barnes was a Pulitzer finalist for her memoir, which I've not read, but the Pulitzer board wouldn't use this novel to line their birdcages. I grant that Barnes is a very good descriptive writer -- very attentive to physical detail -- but the plot was a cross between a bodice ripper and a spaghetti western, with stock characters and totally implausible plot devices. Wolfchild would never have been arrested for murder without a shred of physical or witness testimony against him; one dinner at a local Italian restaurant with Caruso playing in the background would never have been sufficient to turn Buddy on to a life of culture; and the idea that Irene would fall for Buddy is totally preposterous. No point in going on. Don't waste your time."
5,Finding Kim Barnes,"This is a beautiful book: the writing is stunning, always smart and always insightful. And it is a great story, the story of a young man whose love affair with an older woman provides him with a way to live the rest of his life. It's a book about choices and possibilities. It's a book about doing the right thing and believing that it matters. It's a book that shows us, and Buddy Hope, its main character, that there is a way to be a happy, ethical human being in this complicated and often unfair world of ours. FINDING CARUSO will often leave you breathless. You might cry as you read, but you will also surely laugh. And you will not likely read a better novel any time soon."
4,Wonderful for Relaxation - helps with my work!,"I am an end-of-life Midwife and use this music along with Dan Gibson's other music to assist my patients in passing away peacefully. Music is a very strong part of what I do, and it helps keep my patients calm and peaceful. I enjoy listening to it too - I get very relaxed listening to it as well."
4,Solitude's Windsong,"This is a wonderful combination of natural soundscapes with a gentle windchime in the background. It's great for massage, stress reduction, infared booth."
1,Warning The CD's don't play in Media Player softwear BEWARE,"I wasted my money buying 2 Solitude CD's and they won't play in my PC's with any type of Media Player softwear. My technician said it is because they must put some protection on it to only play in players. Which is why they play in my car but not on in my pc. Don't bother contacting the company, they really are horrible at customer service and a total waste of time. I recommend you download their music."
3,Just okay,"It's true that the music, or rather sounds are very relaxing and soothing, but somehow it just does't appeal to me. I can easily fall asleep when listening it."
1,Windsong,"Disappointing. I thought there would be some music - like harp, flute, etc. It was mostly birds and windchimes. It would have been cheaper for me to open my back door and listened the the birds and my porch windchimes."
5,fascinating study of English colonial women travelers,"This is a brilliant, extremely well-written account of English women colonial travellers to India in the nineteenth century. Far form being emancipators of the colonized, Ghose provocatively argues, these women, a la Anna and the King of Siam, were engaged in a ""civilizing"" project of the ""natives"" which was complicit with the orientalist and imperialist interests of the British Empire. Ghose's acute, astute account of the ""female gaze"" as it played out at a particular historical moment has broad implicatins for feminist criticism in general and for film studies as well."
5,This book is excellent,"We purchased this book on cassette for my mother in law, whom has had to deal with a great deal of suffering over the past 20 years. She loved the book so much that she requested several more copies. We glady sent them to her! With so much suffering in her life, it is hard for her to focus on her faith - this book help to answer her questions. Get this for anyone who is suffering, or knows someone who is suffering - they will be blessed."
4,Covers all the bases,"Wonderful study and discussion of God's place in human suffering. I appreciated the way she addressed questions and false perceptions most of us have regarding this issue.I will keep this book and refer to it in the future. I'm happy to have so many verses related to this topic in one place.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that her writing style in the beginning of the book made me uncomfortable. Some of her familiarity toward God and attempts at humor or a lighter tone made me wince. I'd liken it to the style Max Lucado uses, to which I often react the same way. She uses it far less than he, and I know neither author INTENDS any disrespect toward God."
5,This book saved my life.,"Less than a month ago, I had a miscarriage. After the Dr's appointment when we found out the baby had died, The father drove me home, kissed me goodbye and told me he would be back after work to be with me. It is the last time I ever saw or heard from him. Within a week of that horrible day, my very best friend in the world abandoned me without explanation, ignoring my calls and emails to this day. At my very lowest, contemplating suicide, I went home to visit my parents, and picked up this book next to my mother's chair. I hate to read, but God had other plans for me that day. I could not put this book down, and thank goodness I couldn't. This book made evrything so clear to me. My whole sky opened back up. Life seemed worth living again, so that I could serve God. This book truly saved my life, and I would recommend, no, insist that anyone struggling through a hopeless situation read this. Joni is a true messenger of God and His word."
3,A difficult book to handle,"It's not that Tada and Estes don't offer a lot of important truths, or that readers can't find encouragement in this book. What they say needs to be said, especially in light of the ""health and wealth"" gospel that has been so popular in recent decades. They do show why suffering is valuable, even necessary. Still, I found the book frustratingly unbalanced and unfulfilling. Suffering is one side of the coin, but there is another side too. God does sometimes provide deliverance, even miracles, and the authors have very little to say about this. I would have liked the book much better if they had tried to bring both sides into proper focus, instead of focusing almost exclusively on the negative side."
1,I can't give less than one star?,". . . The movie that went down (down being the operative word) in our family history as the most pathetic movie of all time. I saw this when it first came out. We were living in the Australian desert in the village of Woomera, where only one movie plays at a time. We wanted to go to a movie, and there were no choices.. . . This movie has pathetic acting, almost no plot, no direction, comical special effects, and a leading man with no facial expression.. . . And to top it off? It only has two crowns!"
4,Ramar of the Jungle Still Enjoyable,"As a child I would run home from school each day to see the latest adventures of Jon Hall in Ramar of the Jungle. Viewing this again after numerous decades proved equally entertaining. The plots may not have been intricate, but there was always a good lesson in the story line. The clarity of the old footage is remarkable. The neatest part was sharing these with my nephew who is now a fan too."
3,Ramar of the Jungle: Volume 2,"I enjoyed the Ramar series as a young child decades ago. The quality of the picture in this volume could be better, but the enjoyment of remembering is worth 5 stars. If you didn't grow up with Ramar it is more a study of cultural views at the time. It is very obvious that no one cared about authenticating geographical and scientific facts, but as a study of evolving attitudes in American society it is quite interesting. The plot in each episode is almost laughable when viewed in the context of today's sophistication. A matter of taste and interest, but I deemed the entire Ramar collection worth the cost."
3,What kind of clutter?,"This book was not what I thought it would be. I was looking for some concrete inspiration to clear clutter. Although some parts of the book addressed this, much of it was devoted to space age oooooOOOOOooooOOOO stuff. Chiming bells? Sacred candles? I'm familiar with the principles of feng shui, but I believe that Karen Kingston got way off track when she devotes chapters to colonic cleansings. Give me a break. If you are mostly interested in clearing clutter and getting organized, I'd recommend one of Don Aslett's many books. This is not a bad book; it's just pretty light and fluffy."
5,read this now-clear your clutter,"This book is easy to read, the problem with it is you can't put it down AND yet you want to start decluttering. I now have space on my bookshelves. Even gave a few to the library. I am starting to have nice clean space-- it's wonderful."
3,"This book offers ""feng shui lite""","Clear Your Clutter With Feng ShuiKingston's book was the first I had read on feng shui. The first chapter outlines the basics. The rest of the book vastly oversimplifies an aesthetic philosophy with roots in ancient China. Still, thanks to Kingston I am ready to learn more about this practice."
4,motivating,I found this book easy and practical but most of all motivational. I haven't finished the book yet because it motivated me to get started on decluttering my office space.
5,Your spiritual guide to clearing space,"Clear your clutter with Feng Shui"" by de-cluttering specialist Karen Kingston is a must-have book if you are in the process of clearing your space. The book is short and concise, however, very detailed and well written. KK explains what clutter is, why we have it and why is not good for us. She identifies clutter in various areas of the house/office and suggests innovative ways of ditching it for good! In addition, for those who know about Feng Shui, she recommends decluttering based on the Bagua map. Very good book indeed and happy clearing!By Thei Zervaki..."
5,This book changed my life,"I was merely interested in Feng Shui when I ordered this book. It turned out to be the miracle I had not been expecting. After the first few chapters, I started cleaning. Why did it speak to me? I'm a 21 year old packrat... I've saved everything. Every school assignment, every scrap of paper I've ever written on, every broken toy. There was a pathway from my door to my bed. I've given away 4 boxes of clothes I never wear, thrown away 4 garbage bags of junk, and I've just barely started to scratch the surface. I thought I would never have the energy to clean, but this book changed my life."
5,Ready for a life changing event?,"Oh my gosh! I am transferring to another state in a couple of months and my biggest roadblock to dealing with the move was my STUFF. This book came along at just the right time.She leaves no stone unturned including your own thought processes.It gave me the courage to eliminate things that have unpleasant memories, things that I think someday I just might use, things that were expensive that I really no longer like, and as I have weeded through by either giving away or selling these THINGS, I feel more at peace, more free, and surprise dividend, I am loosing weight. I am happier and and am being more mindful of what I eat. I will be giving this book to all my friends who suffer from STUFF-itus."
5,A MUST have for the clutterbugs,"My clutter has been controlling me for years. After reading this book I have given things away without regret, thrown things out without looking back, and have a large garage sale planned for the summer. Basic feng shui is explained, but not in an overpowering way. I cannot say enough good things about this book. Within a week of finishing it I threw out a bunch of junk, gave away a stack of books, a coffee table and a basket with a smile on my face. My husband was shocked! He said it is the best money we have ever spent. I know the line ""if I can do it, anyone can"" is thrown around alot, but believe me - if this book can help and inspire ME to clear my clutter, then you absolutely can do it too."
2,A quick read,"I was disappointed because I was looking for a little more detail about the philosophy behind Feng Shui. Also, this book is poorly written and I think some of the beliefs espoused in it are just downright offensive (all overweight people are messy? -- now is that nice?). Anyway, it did inspire me to Feng Shui my house ... but no more so than any book on organization would have. Now I am going to look for another more detailed book on the subject."
4,Really Good and fast read,I thought that this book explained the basics of feng shui very well. I tried it and things turned around. It is one of the best books out there on this subject.
4,Clear Your clutter with Feng Shui,"It really has helped in analyzing what clutter really means. She makes you even consider cleaning out your email, books that have been read, etc...its a good quick read book with good examples."
2,Speaking of clutter clearing...,"The editor should have cleared a little clutter when publishing this book. I had to read through 7 chapters of the author puffing herself up with examples of her ""successes"" and telling us a bunch of stuff we already know (clutter is oppressive, reasons why we collect clutter, etc. DUH! I know that stuff and/or I don't care. I bought the book to find out what to _do_ about it!). Anyway, chapters 8 and 9 almost give some information on clutter in feng shui, chapters 16 and 17 actually suggest how to approach the decluttering task, and the rest is fluff. Beware - there is very little actual feng shui in this book, and only slightly more useful information on how to clear your clutter. There are even bonus chapters completely unrelated to either feng shui or clutter; instead they're on clearing out your colon and the like. In all, I found roughly 37 pages of the 166 actually useful. Talk about clutter!"
1,A whole lot of not much,"The author of this little tome suggests she and the publisher made it small to help the reader refrain from adding to an already cluttered environment. I suggest it is small because the writer had to stretch and dig to find enough material to fill even these few pages. This material is all basic common sense with a thin section on Feng Shui to put it in a context and give it reason to be. Karen Rauch Carter's ""Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life"" is a thousand times more useful, fun, interesting and worth the money."
4,"very helpful, even if you believe feng shui is a crock","yes, skip the body chapter, and i don't believe in feng shui, but this book is a phenomenal pep talk! My messiness was a running joke for years, but after reading this book, I have managed to clean up my house and keep it clean (for over a year), much to the shock of everyone who knows me! Definately gave me the encouragement i needed!"
3,"very light reading, but still helpful","This book is a very quick read. I found it helpful in identifying why it's so difficult for me to throw out old correspondence, photos, momentos, and the like. I'm not a fan of Feng Shui (This was my first exposure to it), but that aspect didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the book.I would rate it higher but I feel like I only got about 15 pages of useful information out of it."
1,New Age Psycho-babble and not Feng Shui,"The author does provide several good clues for clearling clutter but the message is obscured with her incesstant self-promotion. She provides scant clues to Feng Shui, so little in fact that she could have dropped Feng Shui from the title made no changes to the text. Her book reads more like an advertistment for her dubious services than a help book for those needing to find the benefits of losing their clutter.If you are into rebirthing, crystal power and the other trappings of new age nonsense, this is the book for you. If you are after a good book on clearing clutter save your money and look elsewhere."
4,Educational and Inspiring,"This was a great introduction to making one's home tidy and efficient, and possibly also spiritually 'correct'. Not only was it educational and FUN, but it inspired me to collect and dump a ton of useless stuff I was hoarding, freeing up new space for the things I love. Wonderful!"
5,Everyone needs this,"This is such a great book. I can be a pack rat but am tired of all the ""stuff"" I have accumulated. This book has been wonderful for me. I have suggested it to tons of people. Hope it will help you as well, sure can't hurt!"
5,my most valuable book,"If you feel down because you live with junk but don't have the energy, passion or know-how to let it go, this is the book for you. I'm not even sure I subscribe to Feng Shui or space clearing (which this book discusses), but this is a must-have book for the person who needs a push to declutter their home. Ms. Kingston has a wonderfully refreshing style of writing, and this well-organized book offers clear and concise advice regarding various types of clutter (from how to declutter a kitchen to letting go of unnecessary letters and photos). She also touches upon how to stay on top of future clutter and how to organize, and how it is just as important to clean your mind and body. I can't count the number of times I have opened this book just to soak up a few pages of inspiration. I have seen another ""declutter expert"" on Oprah, and I have scanned other declutter books, but I sincerely feel nothing comes close to this book."
2,It was great until she got to the bottom of things,"She does a good job of defining the differences among clutter, junk, useful stuff, and so on. It is very practical about how to get rid of clutter and ways to think about it.Then she ruins it in the last chapter by going off on a tangent about how your average person has a colon full of things from years past, has a ridiculous drawing of a wiggly colon and insists that the reader rush off to an herbalist for a colon cleanse to get rid of all these accretions from days of yore.I have an acquaintance who is an herbalist, who said it was total nonsense and said that a sigmoidoscopy is going to reveal a smooth, pink interior to one's plumbing and not accretions and agreed it was all very strange.I would suggest Ms. Kingston keep to what she is good at and keep her crackpot theories to herself. She'd have a much better book, for starters."
1,smell my aura,"uh, when I got to the part about her being able to smell clutter in people's auras and then the part about how everything that happens in a house imprints itself into the walls so that if someone who lived in the house before you got fat there you might also get fat there too unless you do the sacred cleansing ritual, and the stories about getting money and more money suddenly coming at you just by cleaning out clutter and then the VERY detailed colon cleansing section at the end, um, I felt the book was not for me."
5,An enlightening clean up,"At this point, I still don't know much about Feng Shui. The book caught my eye at the library for some unknown reason and I started reading it only because it was the thinnest book on my night stand. A day after turning the first page, I was driving my pickup truck back and forth to the recycling center.I doubt everyone will find the same tonic when reading the book, but it worked for me. I think it provided a non-dogmatic twist on 'cleanliness (clutterless-ness) is next to Godliness' and 'the truth (no clutter) will set you free'. Additionally, I suspect the exercise of thinking about family, friends, fame, prosperity, creativity, health, knowledge and livelihood as distinct issues can't hurt."
3,Clean & Clear...Practice makes perfect,"Good Psychology! This book is highly motivating & gives you many reasons to remove the clutter (& stagnation) from your life; especially by helping you understand why you allowed the clutter into your life & why it may be hard to left go of. Is it a fix all? No. Will you become an instant wiz in clean? No. Will it motivate you to clear your clutter? YES! I read it right before I cleaned a room I was having trouble with and found the motivation I needed. Unfortunately, the room is quite a mess again! : ) I will go back to this book to gain the motivation to try again. : ) I lent this book to my mom - who has a definate problem with clutter & it motivated her too! As with any postive changes, if at first you don't succeed...(read!) With the help of this book, I will keep trying. Good luck to you!"
2,Gift,Bought this for my sister. She isn't really sure how she can put it to use. Has a problem with clutter.
5,Life Changing,"This book helped convince my wife to de-clutter. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my chest. This book helps you to understand how clutter is connected to your health, well being and pocket book."
5,wow!,"I have ordered it in Amazon and I have to say thank you to the other reviewers. It is indeed a very useful book, and it pushed me to do what I had in mind: unclutter my apartment!The author is honest and direct. Really resourceful in motivating you. I suggested this book to all the members of my family. I hope this book can be as useful to them as it was to me.I am still in the process, but the the hardest part is done. I'm so happy :-)By the way, the part on body cleansing is very interesting - not for everyone - but it is good food for thought."
5,Life changing,"I read this book years ago, and it completely changed my life. I lived a clutter-filled life, and this book liberated me. Turned me from a pack rat into someone who enjoys clearing the clutter. I still quote it today, several years after reading it, which is why I chose to write a review. My mantra from this book - ""If you don't use it, and you don't love it, throw it away."" Those words completely changed my life and I will never look back."
5,Clear you clutter with this book!,"This book has really opened my eyes to the meaning of clutter. I'm definitely a clutter bug in areas of my life, but I didn't realize that it can actually effect other areas of your life--in relationships, financial,etc. It has great examples from real people who have seen changes happening in areas in their life, by just clearing one spot within their home! It's an easy read too and not too dense."
3,Okay but have seen better,This book focuses on removing clutter. It was not as interesting as some of the other Feng Shui books I have purchased.
4,Clear Your Clutter with Feng Shui,This book got me cleaning. It was interesting to see the explanations of why some people hoard things and helped me actually let go of things in my home that no longer serve a purpose.
4,"It is pretty hippy, but it helps!","Don't listen to the hype. This book is way new age, but what Kingston has to say does in fact work!"
4,Want to get motivated? Read this Book!,"After I finished reading this book, I wanted to try everything in it! However, the feng shui way is not for me. But the basic tips on clearing clutter from your life I found truly helpful. The author sounds like an interesting and organized person and the personal illustrations she used added to the content and made it fun and inspiring to read. This book would be a good one to read at least once per year."
5,It Sure Helps Me!,"It's been said before and I'll say it again - this book is very helpful for people who want to clear the clutter out of their lives but have trouble getting rid of anything. I bought it several years ago and found myself underlining almost every other sentence. Earlier this year I signed up for ""FlyLady"" (an online support group for people with messy homes) which has been very helpful, but I found that if I supplement my ""FlyLady"" work with daily readings from this book, the combination of the two is very powerful. I continue to re-read it whenever I feel myself getting bogged down in my efforts to divest myself of my worldly possessions."
3,Something to think about,I found some good ideas here and a challenge to clear up some of the clutter in my life. An easy to follow and fairly useful application of Feng Shui principles.
3,So Helpful,"This book had a lot of wonderful tips for reducing the amount of clutter and misused space in my home. However, after following the tips I found that after I was complete I did not have a proper, positive place to put this book."
3,"At best, use only as a supplement","I have to admit, I bought this book with high hopes for stopping the pack-rat instinct I inherited from my parents. After reading it, however, I was sadly disappointed. There are a good number of useful bits of information, but without an underlying knowledge of Feng Shui, the book falls flat as far as achieving its goals. My suggestion, if you don't already know a good amount about Feng Shui, then just make a few trips to Borders and read the whole book there without paying for it. If you do have a decent knowledge of the subject, then there really is no need to read this in the first place, now is there?"
5,life changing,"I loved this book. It has changed the way I see my home, the way I view my ""stuff"", the way I purchase things---it's been such a empowering change!I've had my mom, sisters, and friends start reading this book, and they're all HUGE fans too.Definitely a must read. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
5,Changed my life,"I agree with some of the reviewers that this is not necessarily a book about Feng Shui, as I thought it would be. But it was just what I needed. This is a book about clearing your clutter, through Feng Shui principles. It helps you to think about your situation differently.I joined www.flylady.net, which started me on my clutter clearing journey. This site has helped with so much more than clearing clutter. I found this book through a recommendation from flylady.net. This book made me WANT to clear my clutter and live a better life. It gave me a bigger push than my favorite website did.This book has helped me in so many ways. I feel I can conquer materialism and live a freer life."
1,I could have bought another book,"Do me a favor, buy another book! Take out all the feng shui psychobabble and what you have is just a book about clutter. Well, it served as a reference when I wanted to clear my clutter but if you are serious about doing a feng shui on your home, go for the traditional feng shui - the one that the ancient Chinese used. First time I heard about feng shui was last month. I did some research and I've decided I'll go with the tried and true traditional feng shui. These quick fix books are not worth it!"
1,Pseudo-Feng Shui Nonsense!,"Bottom line: clearing clutter has very little to do with feng shui. The only link between clutter and the ancient art and science is that it inhibits the flow of qi, the physical and meta-phyical nourishing force at the heart of everything and everyone. Qi is only one principle of feng shui. There's also the study of the 8 trigrams, the 5 phases, landforms and your environment. However, feng shui is really about the study of time and space. About determining how you are compatible with your home by analyzing the year you were born into (time) to the time your home was built and its magnetic direction (space). Feng shui is not a quick fix or an easy study. Can you learn and practice acupuncture in a weekend? Surely not. By not including all of feng shui's components Ms. Kingston denies the reader an accurate understanding of what feng shui really it."
1,Attractive Cover Page but not very well contents !,"The book has very nice Cover Page ! unfortunately that about it..and nothing else ! the contents is not very good, there almost no illustration, no picture, no example...just word after word like a Romantic novel while the reader is searching for the Feng Shui solution.I don't like it !"
3,Dented Packaging,"I ordered this EDT as a gift for my brother in-law. However, when the package arrived (earlier than I expected), I noticed the packaging was dented and the scratch-and-sniff sticker was almost ripped off. I wouldn't have minded this at all if it was for myself, but since I was planning on giving it as a gift, I wasn't too happy about the scuffs, etc. Other than that, this gift was exactly what I was expecting; I think he will love it."
3,JUST OK,THIS ITEM WORKS AND SMELL JUST FINE. NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT BUT ITS OK.SIM TO THE SAMPLES THAT I GOT AT AN OUTING.
1,VERY FRAGILE,I turned my head for a minute and the polyester filling was everywhere.This product is not for dogs that possess teeth.It ripped apart at the seams right away. What a waste
1,Chinese Junk - Particle Board Crap!!!,Save your time and money on this piece of Made in China Junk - Says crafted wood in the description but it's particle board laminated crap!!! One of the pre-drilled screw holes was not centered in the shelf and the screw (being too close to the edge) blew a piece out of the top of the shelf - It's not real wood - Buyer Beware -
1,Wretchedly Poor DVD Transfer,"This Alpha Video DVD release of an impressively moody and generally underrated Italian horror yarn is a wretched, unwatchable mess. The image is blurred and smeary, and appears to have been taken from a murky fourth-generation bootleg videotape transfer. The horribly garbled sound renders nearly all of the dialogue unintelligible, and absolutely ruins Aldo Piga's score. This is one of the absolute worst legitimate DVD releases I've ever seen, easily on par with Madacy's hideous TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE/NIGHTMARE CASTLE combo. Barbara Steele and Euro-Horror fans are strongly advised to steer clear of this one, despite the tantalizingly cheap list price."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I want to reinforce the prev. reviewer who said steer clear of the Alpha Video DVD. I can tolerate a slightly subpar transfer, but this is intolerable.You can barely tell which actress is Barbara Steele. Avoid."
3,great fun for Barbara Steele fans!,"5 tombe per un medium directed by Massimo Pupillo, is a lackluster spaghetti horror (as in spaghetti western?)! Also known as Cemetery of the Living Dead, this Italian chiller thriller benefits largely from the presence of the stunning queen of horror flicks Barbara Steele. Generally a bunch of nonsense about a terrible plague, in which the victims are then summoned from the dead by an idiot for some vague reason. The transfer is good, but then film was dodge and dubbed to begin with so beware. Still for Steele fans a nice treat at this price."
5,BARBARA STEELE AT HER BEST,"THIS IS A 5 STAR MOVIE,,,REGARDLESS OF WHAT THESE OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE SAID,,,THEY GIVE YOU THE RATING ON THE QUALITY OF THE DVD,INSTEAD OF THE MOVIE ITSELF,,PEOPLE THIS IS AN OLD MOVIE AFTER ALL!!IF YOU LIKED NIGHTMARE CASTLE,BELIEVE ME YOU WILL LIKE TERROR CREATURES FROM THE GRAVE."
4,Lovely! Great merengue,"The Merenhits series released yearly by J & N Records is always a well organized selection of songs that have become hits during the year. This edition- Merenhits 2000 is a great production from start to finish with a variety of different styles of merengue which definitely makes the cd a good buy for even the most selective merengue followers. The cd is very upbeat and definitely can liven up any party in a dull moment. Also, it includes two bachatas, one by Frank Reyes and the other by Los Toros Band which is nice treat. If you are looking for a merengue compilation that is danceable or just nice to listen to Merenhits 2000 should definitely be on your list. Enjoy!"
5,Simplifies Computing,"When learning about computers, especially for those of us using them on the homefront, who wants a huge tome of information we'll never use?Not me. Keep it simple.""The little PC Book Windows XP Edition"" by Larry Magid keeps it simple.This is for the everyday user, the one who has no desire (or need) to become Microsoft Certified, who just wants to use his or her computer, and not get lost in the technology of it all. XP is different than its Windows ancestors, yet clearly is part of the family. Magid helps you know when the differences matter.Magid keeps the language simpler than a radio compter talk show, and readers will rejoice at the book's accessibility.Pictures are worth a thousand words of techie talk, and Magid is sure to realize this, providing necessary charts, screenshots, etc. He answers the questions you want answers to in a manner you'll understand.I fully recommend ""The little PC Book Windows XP Edition"" by Larry Magid.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
4,a very good debut(to my knowledge),"i recently picked up warrior king's virtuous woman and think that it was a good find. his vocal quality is among the best that i have heard. the songs are powerful and inspiring. they touch upon the core of reality, which is our humanity. i really want to give this album a five but think that if i do, it would be hard to judge any of his upcoming albums because i would always use it(virtuous woman) as sole criterion when judging the others. as i mentioned, all the songs are good but i am a big fan of the following: power to chant, never go where pagans go, africa shall be free, education is key,virtuous woman, oh mama, and what's going on. the lattr is a remake of the marvin gaye classic. warrior king also big up black women, a population in our society and the world that do not always get the recoginition that they deserve, on the album. go out and get it. it is truly refreshing."
2,Not more....just worse,"For anyone who hasn't seen the first Lost Reality I'll clue you in...Lost Reality is a collection of short skits designed to look like rejected reality TV shows. They all come off as being realistic and almost believable. I would compare them to Jackass or Punked. They all have the same jaw-dropping, ""I can't believe they did this"", humor; very edgy and crude.Now the second title in the series just tries too hard to recreate the humor of the first one. Between skits the writers add commentary and pointless banter from themselves. I found nothing in the commentary funny and it was pretty stupid. Some skits are funny and downright hilarious (i.e. I can't believe they did that!) and others just come off as boring. I'd say they were 50/50. The commentary just ruined the DVD.Overall, I would probably save my money and rent this once and let it be."
2,Another tennage film,Don`t know if it was the subject or just the actors..Certainly is in the B class for film..Not so major was the acting or the story line.Plently of youngters to keep you glued.
3,The Purpose Driven Church is more helpful,This book was interesting to read if you are curious about the history of Willow Creek. But alot of this church's story isn't applicable to the average church. If you want practical help and inspiring encouragement get The Purpose Driven Church by Rick Warren. I found it very transferable and useful in developing a philosophy of ministry. Willow Creek is certainly impressive but Warren's book has the practical wisdom.
2,Whats The Authority Here?,"I must say Bill here is a whole lot more polished than Rick. There are some Wonderfully insightful tools in this book. Unfortunately, the Authority here is not Scripture. Ministry Experience is the Authority. Calling this ""new wave"" the work of the Holy Spirit is Diceptive. You Cannot seperate the Holy Spirit from the Scriptures. They do not work seperately or contradict each other. But, you don't have to take my word for it. Just be a Berean."
5,This is Church,"I have been a student of the church for the past eight years, and a few years ago I started reading Acts looking for principles to guide the church into the 21st Century. Then I read 'Rediscovering Church,' and I was amazed by the parallels. Much attention has been given to the ""Seeker Philosophy"" of Willow Creek, yet this book points to the heart of their growth!"
5,"The story of WIllow Creek- warts & all-Lynne can write, too!","This is the exhilirating, confusing, honest, hindsight-influenced story of one of the largest churches in America. It is also not a ""how to"" book, but a ""how we did it- don't copy us"" book. The Hybels, like Rick Warren, open up and show their warts (maybe a little more so than Warren), but also share the excitement, tragedy and wonder of God's work in suburban Chicago. A must for anyone wanting to grow a church- new, old or ancient!"
1,"Paid for new, came used",i threw it out. It came used. I didn't have the time to return it. And I was annoyed that it came used because I paid for new. This was my only bad experience with amazon.
2,Cd,"I bough this by mistake,but i did not return and never use it either,so no common.Thanks a lot for asking?"
5,Awesome backpack!,"My son loves this backpack! Great colors. The Boston Red Sox logo is authentic and well crafted. High quality, but not too heavy for a 10 year old. Alot of pocket space for all his school supplies. Very much worth the money! Thanks!"
1,Glenn has lost his way,"If you enjoy Glenn's flirtations with soul singing over extremely thin chord changes and out of key guitar soloing (thank you, Steve Salas), then maybe this album is for you. It sure wasn't for me. I preferred his singing in Deep Purple and on his two prior solo albums, ""From Now On"" and ""Addiction."" More to the point, though, is the songwriting. I just don't ""feel"" Glenn achieved very much in these songs; in fact, I don't think he achieved anything other than to convince me he has to work with higher caliber guitar players to write or co-write the songs (paging Marc Bonilla, Ritchie Blackmore, Pat Thrall, etc) for him to make a musical statement that I can enjoy."
4,"Glenn Hughes, along with Paul Rodgers, Ian Gillan, best ever","Glenn's singing is awesome on this, the guitar playing is inventive as all three guitarists (Jocke Marsh, George Nastos, and Steve Salas) featured show nice touch. One of my friends (a guitar player) says that this CD is one of the best of the decade...I don't know if I would go that far, but songs like ""The Curse"" make it stand above the vast majority of what is released nowadays...also some very good mid-paced songs that allow Glenn to show his vocal chops...I would rate Glenn tied with Paul Rodgers as the best Rock/R&B vocalists alive. Ian Gillan would be the only one who can touch them in range (Ian has fried his vocal chords but in the early 70's was the best Rock vocalist ever! ) and/or emotion with a honorable mention to David Coverdale, Ronnie James Dio, Klaus Meine, and Rob Halford. Buy this CD! You will not be disappointed."
3,ENTERTAINING B!!!!!,"The Alpha disc is far from perfect(splices, etc.), but I haven't found any better. Great cast of actors."
4,midnight manhunt,"this movie has leo gorcey in it from the dead end kids, copy is ok, movie is ok too.. classic leo who is trying to fix a electric chair in a wax musseum of criminals,,when a dead body turns up, then disapears the chase is on to find out who the killer is,,if you collect dead end kid movies you should like this one"
1,Actual Customer,"Shipping was great - even to Australia. Arrived in time and in perfect condition.I bought the CD for only one song, ""Processional in D"" as my wife and I wanted it for our wedding, and we used it. As for the rest of the CD it sounds like it should have been released in the 60's rather than in 1999.The music I found tacky, outdated and the non-lyrical versions I equated to bad elevator music. Not my type of music. I suggest listen to some samples online before you seriously think about taking the above review for gospel."
4,Good scary Howling Movies,"I enjoyed watching the Howling movies, scary and good. Nothing like a good Wolf movie. It came nicely packaged too."
1,Horrible seller,Product was used in a tattered previously opened package. It was also chipped and does not appear to function properly. It arrived in 4 days with a 2day shipping payment. Would give 0 star if I could.
2,Gus (Not Gus),"What a great album title, too bad the album doesn't live up to the promise. Not to be confused with the Gus that released the fine pop album `Word Of Mouth Parade', this is a Canadian punk band, and not a very good one. Fans of the other Gus should avoid this album, punk fans may enjoy the amateurish attitude that colors this disc, but I found the whole thing off putting. Not horrendous, but not good either, best tracks are track 20 (an untitled instrumental) and `f---in Nazi'. After buying this, I hesitated before buying the other Gus albums, both of which are excellent, don't make the same mistake."
3,Terrific fun but stiff writing and dialogue,"Her Majesty's pride and joy, Bond -James Bond - grapples with the usual international intrigue and espionage on the eve of Hong Kong's return to Chinese control.Bond is dispatched to investigate the murders of top managers in a powerful Hong Kong-based British corporation and, as usual, manages to accumulate a bevy of beautiful women along the way.""Zero Minus Ten"" seems to take pride in its stiff dialogue, as shown in the following shipboard adventure-rescue sequence between Bond and his love interest, Sunni:""James, Oh God, James!"" she cried.""It's all right! Hold on,"" he said, untying her. Once she was free he gave her a quick hug and kiss. She didn't want to let him go, but he broke free.""Sunni, the bomb!"" he said, then turned his attention to the large metal bowling pin fastened to the deck of the sampan.""Stay with the bomb, James. I'll take care of this creep,"" Sunni shouted. It may never win a Pulitzer, but James Bond is still as irresistible as ever."
5,I really like this book!,This book was good from cover to cover. I was not disappointed at all. The Chinese meaning of words were well described throughout and I never became lost. As I read the book I kept seeing mental pictures of 007 (played by Sean Connery). This one would make a good movie. Read this! You will not be sorry.
4,very solid bond book,excellent details and great action rate this book in a must read category. i recommend it definitely for bond buffs and even for the people looking for a great book to read!!
1,The worst Bond book ever,"This is without a doubt the worst Bond book ever! I have read all of Ian Fleming's and John Gardner's and for the most part was impressed with the writing style and the commitment to the character Fleming created. Raymond Benson, however, is a terrible writer and writes Bond horribly. From the lame and unwitty remarks 007 exchanges with 05 at the beginning, to the unintelligent excuse for a briefing with M, to Bond calling Q ""Major"", Benson has ruined the character and the genre. And the worst was when Bond discusses CLASSIFIED material about his mission in a restaurant! Of course he's overheard! What a lame plot development. I don't ever recall Bond as this stupid and un-Bondlike in all the novels and all the movies. Whoever picked this guy as the new ""Bond author"" should be fired. I don't think I'll ever pick up another Bond book until someone else starts writing them. Find someone with some sense of Bond and the style related to him!"
4,I love Benson's Bond!,"I love the way Benson writes Bond. I would just like to go on record as saying that ""Doubleshot"" wasn't very good, but I love ""Zero Minus Ten"". The opening of this novel is thrilling and it continues throughout the book. The only bad thing about this book is that it can be dated, which may mean that it will never become a movie. When you near the end and realise that it isn't over and they fly to Australia, that's when it hits you, I couldn't put it down after that."
4,Good Bond,"This is a good Bond Adventure. This being his first Bond book, I thought that there were some -small- things that needed tweeking. Very Small things. I suggest -highly- suggest his second Bond book ""The Facts of Death"". That's an -excellent- read. The small thing were fixed, and I loved that book. This book isn't bad, don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed it."
5,Ian Fleming Lives!,"A terrific book. A must read for all James Bondfans. Raymond Benson has captured the flavour andstyle of the original Ian Fleming novels. A goodand topical plot. The minor vilains were somewhatmore interesting than the major ""bad guy.""This would make a terrific film."
2,Past its Prime,"There are certain faint stylistic echoes, in the mise-en-scene of various chapters, of the Fleming manner in its crisper mode, but otherwise absolutely nothing, not even token appearances by M and Miss Moneypenny, a shower with a girl named Stephanie or a more than nodding acquaintance with the rules of mahjong, can convince us that this epigonic lay-figure, mixed up with Triad rituals, aborigine walkabouts, a cargo of heroin in Portsmouth harbour and a Chinese general called Wong, is the genuine Taittinger-swigging 007. Leave the old boy alone, or, still better, turn him into what he really is, the hero of a lavish costume movie. Merchant-Ivory doing James Bond? May I live to see it!"
1,...a license to kill.....,"What can be said about Zero Minus Ten? Benson's prose style is weak, the plot is transparent and lacking in suspense, and betrays a misunderstanding of Bond, his motivations, and interests. Bond worrying himself over the fate of the Hong Kong people, abstractly, like a political scientist? Bond reveling in a dangerous gunfight? Bond startled by what he sees and hears while spying on a secret ceremony? Not bloody likely. Raymond Benson may be a fan of Ian Fleming's Bond, but Zero Minus Ten doesn't even approach the sophistication of the films much less the elegant savagery of the original novels. It seems fitting that as the films have become more universal, relying on impersonal action and giving only the slightest nod to traditional Bondian themes, Benson should be composing drivel like Zero Minus Ten."
1,"If I wanted to read a movie script, I would go to Hollywood!","I am sorry, but I do not like Bensen's books at all. It is like reading the movie script. Bensen writes his book just like the movies and it was Boring! He tried to sound like Flemming but came off as a second rate hack! He spent too much time describing the surroundings and not enough on the action and real plot. Most say that Bensen is great and following in Flemmings footsteps but for me I feel bad for the REAL James Bond fans who want more than just a movie script in hardcover form. Benson, stick to writing bedside companions and leave the real writing to the pro's."
1,One of the worst Bond titles ever!,"This book marks the decent of the literary Bond into the fool hardy sex machine that the screen incarnations of Bond love to portray. You'll find that the original plot line has merit but the ensuing adventure falls into a pattern of ludicrous action scenes followed by gratuitous sex. Are we to believe the sophisticated Bond that Ian Flemming created is lurking in Hong Kong cathouses getting lap dances? Must we endure phrases like ,""Any normal man would die doing this but James Bond is a master of..."", (fill in whatever Benson has Bond doing at the time)every time Bond does something? Flemming provided us with a much more ""human"" character than this. Any true fan will save themselves the heartache of reading this and stick to what Flemming, Amis, and Gardner left us with."
2,"Excuse me, Mr.Bond? Please come back.","Sorry Mr.Benson I have all of the Flemming ""Bonds"" 5 in hardbound. I have all of the Gardner ""Bonds"" in Hardbound AND paperback. I cannot get into your ""Bond"" I find ""Bond"", in general, a very complex and provocative person. Your ""Bond"" seems to be a bit...dull. After reading ""Zero"" I'm not shaken, I'm not stirred... Just Bored...James Bored."
2,The Zero in the Title Refers to Raymond Benson,"Raymond Benson is the worst when it comes to picking up where Ian Fleming and John Gardner left off. As a die hard Bond fan, it simply stuns me that he got the nod to become the official ""Bond"" scribe.First of all, his writing style is for 5-year-olds. Second, he smacks readers over the head with too much sex. Fleming did not go into lurid details, neither did Gardner. As a result Benson throws the class and style of the previous books out the window.In a horrible short 007 story Benson wrote for Playboy, he brings back Irma Bunt of Spectre. Terrible. The character was not his to mess with. It's almost as rediculous as brining Goldfinger back from the dead 40 years on.I urge fans to give Benson a wide berth and to stick with the Fleming and Gardner books. The poor quality of his books just show that he is a fanboy with poor literary talent.Bond would never settle for second best, why should you?"
2,Strange???,It really puzzles me about how James Bond can understand the Chinese charaters on the Mahjong tiles.
3,Enjoyable Afternoon Read,"This is an O.K. Bond screenplay, but a bit disappointing book. It seems to me the author was writing the book with a movie in mind, what happened to the aging secret agent going through mid-life crisis? What happened to the kinky, chauvinistic, alcoholic, cold blooded killer we all know and love?Don't get me wrong, I liked the story, even if it is predictable, and I enjoyed reading the book, I guess it's not the Bond I'm used to.My fault .... but if you are looking for a nice, light, Sunday afternoon read, this is it."
5,Bill Engvall's Best!,Bill Engvall's Best! Aged and Confused? yes he is but that's not the point. This is Bill's greatest must see stuff. He explains why He is confused because. Because he has aged? You sometimes forget how you feel how your aging as you hear Bill tell how well He's aging himself.Top comedy from one of the Blue Collar Guys. This is a must get that will have you laughing at Bill as well as yourself. This has to be Bill Engvall's best stuff!
3,It was ok,There were some funny parts in this but it was a bit more lacking that some of his other work.
3,Love Love Love Bill Engvall,"I'm a BIG fan of Bill Engvall, but was a little disappointed with this DVD. Some of the material seemed to be old stuff that I had heard before. I didn't pay much for it so that made it ok. Plus my daughter is a BIG fan also and I gave it to her."
3,Not the Best,"Product is in good shape, but didnt like the show itself. Definitely not his best work I found this tape boring"
3,Not his best,"I am a HUGE Bill Engvall fan, but this was not his best DVD. It's funny, but not quite the same level as ""Here's Your Sign"" or ""15 degrees off cool""."
4,Funny take on getting older,"We are big fans of Bill Engvall and he did not disappoint us with this show. We also happened to see it performed live before the DVD came out and I would rate this just as high as seeing it in person. The only reason I didn't rate it with five stars is that I think it should be longer. If you have ever enjoyed Bill Engvall, Blue Collar Comedy shows, etc. then you will enjoy this one. Since we are about the same age, his observations are particularly humorous to me because he talks about real-life situations and they really are funny when we look back on them."
3,Geared for the masses...,"Good book, but its only purpose is to appeal to ""the masses."" Most volleyball books are designed to help everyone; whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced player. Let's face it, if you're trying to make a lot of money off a book...that's the best way to go. However, if you're already a good player, you're not going to benefit much from this book. You're much better off buying Mark Tanner's Smarter Volleyball. It actually talks about the ""mental game,"" rather than the traditional pass, set, hit scenario that you see in most of these books. I've been Karch's biggest fan for most of my life, but to be honest...this book is a waste of time if you're actually wanting to get to a higher level of play. If you're just starting out, buy the book...but if you're looking for more indepth strategies, go with Mark Tanner's book or one of the ""lesser known"" authors...they're probably not in it for the ""big"" money."
4,Exactly as described,I ordered this book for my husband who speaks Cantonese but doesn't know how to write the characters. This was the only book out there and it's in good shape.
4,not bad at all,"Bubbbas ""Dark Days, Bright Nights"" was mediocre. There were mostly half-assed songs on there with a few exceptions. The first 2 singles for his second album ""Deliverence"" are better than most of his other songs that we've heard. The song ""Deliverence"" is a more serious song with an acoustic guitar. I didn't think he was capable of this kind of music but i guess he is cuz this is a really good song. The second song ""Jimmy Mathis"" is decent. is a little short with 2 verses but it has a nice quick southern beat that makes up for it.So far so good. Lets hope the whole album is this good."
1,not worth the time it took to unwrap the package,"same, old boring plot that the first version back in the 80's had -- they add new 3d-ish graphics and a wee bit more detail to the game and re-release it. there are plenty of free games that do a whole lot better than this puppy.."
4,Another up-and-coming Texas music hero!,"Owen Temple is quickly following in the tracks of Robert Earl Keen, Jerry Jeff Walker, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Guy Clark and other great singer/songwriters. General Store is not perfect but definitely above average. With a few improvements, Owen will perfect his skills and abilities and go down in history as a great one."
4,Gifted writer,"Joyce Carol Oates is a gifted writer, and although I enjoyed this book because of its attention to detail, that detail was also one of the aspects I didn't like. I was impressed with Ms. Oates study and expertise of boxing, but I also found it detracting to the story, at times. Still, this is a good book and worth the read."
3,Moderate,"I didn't intend to finish reading this book, but once I started I couldn't stop. I didn't like it all that much, but it wasn't a waste of time. It was well written and vivid, while disturbing at times. Honestly, the relationship between Enid and Felix intrested me, and Warren's tale was worthwile as well, but I didn't really like it as a whole. Some parts were quite predictable or seemed rough around the edges. If you're a fan, I'm sure you'll like it, but others may be wary."
5,You WILL Rember This,"I read this book a number of years ago and I can still remember, vividly, what the story is about--the characters--the setting. I took to watching boxing for a while after I read it, not the big title matches but the small town boys going at it dreaming of fame. Thanks to Ms. Oates' love for boxing I found a new way to see this ""sport"". But that is not what I remember most. I remember a character who is nothing short of a despicable, who does evil, unspeakable things and who I was made to care about. I don't think he will ever leave me...I couldn't forget him if I tried. Reading Oates can make you a more compassionate person--if you want her to our not. What a gift. Read the book, you won't be sorry you did--and, it is my guess that you too will remember this one."
4,Oates rocks!!,Oates is such an interesting writer! Every one of her books seems to have a different writing style. This one is long and intricate and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Didn't want it to end.
3,"Lovely Patterns, but Patterns are Not Too User-Friendly","I got this book to help me with designs for an afghan block swap project that I am doing. The patterns in here are lovely, but I have a few reservations about recommending this book:First of all, the patterns given are for making 6"" square blocks only. No gauge is given for any of the patterns. Second, the designs are written for using DK weight yarn. (And the author didn't state that all the yarns used were DK weight until the back of the book!)These facts make it quite difficult for me to increase the block designs to what I am interested in making, which is a 12"" square block using worsted weight yarn.So far, though, once I figured out the correct gauge for my project, the designs do seem to be free of errors.If you are interested in making an afghan using DK weight yarn, this book would be much more useful to you. But on the flip side, an afghan made with DK-weight yarn is not going to be as substantially warm as one made with worsted yarn."
3,"Some inspiration, many errors","There are some excellent ideas in this book, however, there are numerous errors--especially in the lacy patterns. Only two corrections are listed on publishers site. Could have been a lot better."
5,Excellent Book!,"I love this book! I'm using it to make a blanket for my mother right now; so far, I've knit about 10 different blocks. The instructions are well-written with no mistakes, and each block is shown clearly, some with color variations. There are some suggestions for blocks to combine into blankets or pillows, but I prefer to make up my own design. One caveat: the current picture of the book on Amazon does not show the real cover of the book, the blocks shown in this picture aren't in the book, but the blocks shown on the actual book cover are inside the book. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with it. Highly recommended!"
3,Only about 124 different patterns really,"""... your choice of 200 knitted block patterns!""Because I do not see that changing the color of your yarn changes the pattern if you have the same exact stitches, I only count 124 block patterns in this book. The 124 patterns are nice, but saying there are 200 is misleading."
5,Afghans Made Easy,"With this nifty little book, you'll be creating colorful, interesting afghans in no time. The instructions are clearly written, and they cover everything from basic to advanced knitting techniques. You can follow suggested combinations of squares or let your imagination go and create your own designs."
3,Interesting,"have used it a few times, some blocks may be hard to adapt to large blocks, but most can be. Good reference book, but frankly there are other books on the market are free on line that are as good."
2,Suprisingly different from Crochet with Blocks,"Really, not as stimulating as Crochet with Blocks by the same author. To me, it seemed like less variety in the knitting blocks."
2,not what I expected,"There is too much repetition and too little imagination. I purchased the book especially for a pattern I saw on the cover. Beware, what is on the cover on this page is not what's on (or in) the book. I doubt I'll be knitting anything from this book."
5,It's poly tape,Tape arrived in good time and was used quite fast considering the weather we were expecting here around Houston. Used it to replace the tape on the sprinkler riser and the water softener and use was simple and it seems to be of good quality. I'll update this after a good hot summer works its wonders and let you know how durable it actually is.
2,Alert button not for many elderly,"The MAJOR problem (other than the first unit being defective) I have with this product is that the alert button is challenging. You have to hold it down for 4 seconds to activate, but it cancels if you hold it for more than 8 seconds.For my elderly Dad, he either kept pushing the button, or held it down forever. Neither would have set off the emergency sequence. I'm not sure what he would do in a real (panic) emergency, but I don't want to find out. There is an LED that flashes when it is set off, but he would never get to that point if he just keep pushing the button over and over.This is a really dumb design. I'd rather put up with some false alarms than have a button you could cancel. I'd constantly be wondering if he had fallen and couldn't remember how long to hold down the button.There are some pendants that have 2 buttons - just as confusing. So, still looking..."
1,Does not work as advertised,The primary emergency calling feature dials the numbers as programmed but the emergency message which is heard loudly in the room with the phone cannot be heard on the other end of the line when the emergency call is answered. In a converation with the seller they promised to contact the manufacturer for a resolution but over 3 weeks passed with no response. The vendor eventually agreed to a 100% refund on the phone.
2,MR. BIG BOX NOT SO BIG,"i was disappointed with the packaging of the Mr. Big Box. the six discs (all studio albums) came in three clear double jewel cases with just the front cover inserts (in a separate pack). the booklet is all in Japanese (NO OFFENSE JAPAN!). the t-shirt says ""mr. big"" on the neck collar in very small lettering with all of their Japanese history tour dates on the back...not to mention the quality of the shirt isn't heavy duty either.the only plus is the bonus track on each CD, which is why i bought it. i think that this boxed set could've been packaged better than it was. if you're a diehard Mr. Big fan like i am, it's endless hours of enjoying their great music! if not, you're not missing much!"
4,peter pan and tinker bell,every thing it was advertised to be thanks a lot will be prone to purchase from you all again
4,Excellent supplement to teaching Industrial Revolution,"I used this video in my 9th grade World History class and although the animated sections are somewhat juvenile, the information is historically sound and illuminating. It appears to be the only viable educational video on the Industrial Revolution out there. I highly recommend it."
3,A bit disappointed,I was hoping I could use this book for reference but the photos inside have failed to capture the color and beauty that is the wardrobe of Chinese opera.
5,Absolutely wonderful,"Beautifully produced and a real pleasure to use. Treat yourself to this one - you deserve it!The meditations can be used seated in a chair, on the floor cross-legged, lying down or even in the standing meditation postures used by Chinese martial arts such as Yiquan.I'm hooked!"
5,If only all Christian Living books where this good,"This is one of the few 'Christian Living' books I've been impressed with. The author is very open and honest, writing with emotion on every page. This book is what evangelicals need to read."
5,no special as a belt,"it is cheap and it is good. it is a simple belt without special characters..So it is good, and I liked it."
1,Seemed to be good quaility,"The leather was nice, the buckle looked good, the belt had a good feel...and the tongue on the buckle broke the third time I wore it. Probably a flaw in the metal but it doesn't speak well for the quality of the casting. Amazon quickly processed a refund less a $3 restocking charge (?). Why restock a defective item?"
3,"Nice quality, surprise stitching","There is beige-ish stitching near the buckle that can't be seen from the front of the belt, or in the picture; but it is visible on the side of the belt, so when you look down at it you can see the bright threads. That wasn't expected and it is distracting, but to everyone other than the wearer the belt looks really nice!It is sturdy, of good quality. Just don't like that stand-out stitching."
4,Just what I expected,What can you say about a belt other then whether its fits or not it does I guess it's not as thick as I expected but who cares really it will hold my pants up and my holster fits it perfectly
4,Good belt,this is a great quality belt. sure to last many years and breaks in well. only thing in it left marks on my jeans...fine since im wearing the belt over it anyway. might want to look up how to reduce staining
4,What is says it is,"Great belt, great price, just what it says it is. Looks great on my jeans. I was looking for the 1 1/2"" width and this belt was the most reasonably priced. Got my goods very quickly."
2,Pass,"This sounds like practice room Nomeansno before they discovered punk rock. Lots of low energy jazzy noodling. I love everything they did after this, but this sounds like a different band."
2,Beware the ingredients...,"This product contains soy, a real surprise to me, and unfortunately I'm stuck with a huge bottle of this with no recourse to return it.If you avoid soy like so many do, you'll want to find a grass-fed, pastured farm and get some actual liver instead. Once cooked in a little clarified butter, it's not bad, and can be quite juicy (unlike the dry stuff I remember from childhood). If you don't care for the taste, you can always pop it in a food processor and sneak it into green smoothies and the other meat on taco or spaghetti night. :)Max Gerson once used raw liver to treat cancer patients with outstanding success, but you'd never want CAFO livers, so again, find a quality farm who feeds animals the way they were meant to be fed (GRASS), and buy there. Yes, it costs a bit extra, but I'd rather reward the farmers for doing things the right way than pay the hospital later."
3,Does it work? Who knows. But at that price you can't really go wrong.,"First let me just say that one container of 500 will last you until the 2nd coming. I've had this for a very long time, and I still haven't finished the first container.Effectiveness? I have no idea. I don't really see any change when I add it or remove it from my diet.Worth it? At that price, even if it makes the slightest improvement to my diet, then its worth it.Warning- These things are HUGE tablets. Swallowing one is not an easy task, much less so when doing 3-6 consecutively."
1,If you can swallow these...,I would have loved to try the product but they are the size of golf balls. Purchase only if you can swallow entire meatballs without chewing.
2,Disappointed,I was excited to receive this product as I was using it to help in my pregnancy since I do not like the taste of liver. I do not know if I missed the fine writing while looking this product up on amazon or not but when I got the product at home I noticed that it said in the state of California this product is known to cause birth defects....what???!!! I was not willing to risk taking this product and so it has gone to waste.
3,Waiting for results,I have not been on this supplement very long about 3 weeks. I have made some gains in strength but I can not be sure if I can attribute them to the supplement or my training regimen. I think I would have to give it more time.
2,Short-Circuited Ions,"This is a one-tape charade into the some ""mental"" exercises. The exercises are extremely boring and consists on inverting words, counting different numbers, and...definitely not fitted to be driving a car with! I almost crashed when attempting to reverse a long word in my head as requested (they don't give you any technique for that either)."
5,great,this cd is great but in all fairness it does not quite live up to the first cd starving st. nick. the remake of detective friend though i think is better here than on st. nick. the cd s however do not show the true power of a slow roosevelt live show
4,Real Arcade: Shape Shifter,This game is addictive. Good for hours of fun. Good for exercising hand-eye coordination. Music is fun too.
4,Mad Dog 128mb video card,"It works fine, no problems installation was a challenge. It took three tries before it correctly installed. After that It works like gang busters. I'm satisfied."
4,For fans of the TV Show...,"This is a good simple story about obedience and responsibility and a departure form the the TV show. My daughter is a big fan and at 2 years old the story was a little ""over her head"". I would recommend for slightly older children who are familiar with this characters."
1,"Written by a business man, not a musici","It is bad, does not transition well. I could say that it is bad because after a couple years of practice I hhave reflected on it and I now see that it is bad"
5,Great Devotional For Young Athletes,"This booklet is a great motivational book for athletes. It both focuses on making you have better Godly character, as well as improving your physical talent. There is a total of 25 daily devotions. Each day contains a opening bible verse, a message, and then a closing question which the author calls the ""Extra Point"". This booklet is very fun to read and has great messages conveyed throughout that really make you think about important things. I recommend this booklet to any young athlete."
3,It's OK but not that great,"We are big Spot fans, and I was excited when I was notified that this book was coming out. We received it as a gift. My kids weren't interested since it didn't have flaps and nothing happens in the story. Just a nice little tribute to Spot's mom... nothing special. I probably wouldn't have bought this one."
2,"Okay, but NO flaps!!","I'm a little annoyed, because unless I'm blind, the description of the book does not mention that there are no flaps, as in the other Spot books. I ordered this one as well as the similar ""daddy"" book and neither of them have the flaps, which is why I ordered them in the first place."
4,Eric Hill has it good,"My daughter loves Spot. God knows why, as the drawing and the storylines tend to be pretty mediocre. But she does really really love all of Eric Hill's books, including this one. She is 3 y.o. and has had it for over a year, and still requests it during reading time. The simple wording and pictures allow her to ""read"" it to herself when I'm not available to do so. It's like those Maisey books. We adults just don't get it, but will your kid love it? Almost certainly."
4,Cute,Short and sweet. My 10 month old loves looking at this book (and swatting at it). Spot was a big favorite of mine when I was a kid and I am happy with this book.
4,Seeking out a vision for your church community,"As pastor of a small Protestant church community in a European country which is truly becoming 'secular city' it is important to find material in order to try to formulate a vision - a new way of doing church in our postmodern times. I found Rick Warren's book truly valuable - the Church Council are using it now to evaluate the way forward - because a Church without a vision or mission is hopelessly lost! I would highly recommend the book to other pastors.Susan WatersOpstandingskerkAalst, Belgium"
5,NOTHING BETTER NOR MORE BIBLICAL!,"I wish I'd had this book when I began my ministry. It is the best biblical tool I've ever read for reaching, growing, training, and sending out people to fulfill God's purpose in the world. I thank God for the truth of His Word that is so clearly communicated here."
2,Church Growth Saddleback Style,"I enjoyed reading Rick Warren's book, but a closer reading suggests that it suffers from the same problem that plagues much church-growth literature: a faulty assumption. ""A healthy church will grow,"" is the fundamental assumption underlying Warren's book. But what theological warrant do we have for this assumption? In John 6, Jesus speaks to a large crowd about their need to ""eat his flesh and drink his blood."" This truth-telling (i.e. seeker-oriented?) approach to ministry actually led many of Jesus' followers to abandon him (John 6:66). The pressing question for the church-growth movement in America is whether it believes that the church's misson to be a truth-telling people will of necessity lead to an increase in numerical growth. I, for one, am skeptical. Further, there is a continuing need for reflection on the theology of worship and theology of preaching underlying Warren's book. Such a task is beyond the scope of this present review."
1,I thought we weren't supposed to conform to the world???,"I wish I could give this book a minus star because its set a terrible example and is causing many sheep to starve. Rick Warren encourages pastors to run their church like a corporation using statistics and surveys to determine what message to preach and what music to play, etc.. This is so sad and is an example of the state of the church(in the USA) right now. The whole seeker friendly movement is causing much damage to the Body of Christ.PASTORS, if you want your church to grow then start praying, fasting and seeking God's face again!! Don't run to Egypt!Stop robbing the people, Pastors. If you want to be a CEO resign from your church and go secular. Otherwise come back to preaching the Cross!Preach Christ and Him crucified!!"
1,The Purpose is to make people feel good and join.,"The Purpose Driven, or seeker friendly movement makes the gospel secondary to a friendly, enjoyable church experience. the tragedy is that people will think they are saved when they are not. This is fool's gold. It's the latest church deception which thousands of pastors are buying into."
2,"Cancer grows fast, too.","The principles of consumer marketing can fill a building once a week for almost any purpose: fish fries, rock concerts, mud wrestling, you name it. The purpose of *evangelism* is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ: that the Way of the Cross is in fact the Truth and the Life. It is not surprising that no cross ""obstructs the view"" at Saddleback ""Church."" Sacrifice, voluntary suffering, and solidarity with the poor in the struggle for justice don't make it in the door at this megachurch.I give this book two stars because there are some useful pointers in how to lift up a vision that will motivate a congregation to take risks in faith for the sake of those who have not heard the gospel. For the *content* of that gospel, run, do not walk, towards writers who understand that it is the Lamb who was slain that we follow."
1,"It is nothing like the ""Purpose Driven"" which is awesome; this book is kinda vague..sorry","I guess I love the tapes so much that I thought this book was going to be like THE PURPOSE DRIVE; our reasons for being here. I just love those tapes..I really cannot figure out what the author wants me to know in this book. It is different from his other writings; in that, his message is not clear.""Yes,"" I understand the purpose of the church, but what does the author want me to know about its purpose.If the purpose is ""fellowship"" what type? He mentions discipleship, make it plainer please. His message wants me to think about a ""healthy"" church; in what way??? I mean how can people build a church without their donations, and attendance, etc. That's all they know. And Rick Warren does not tell me how to replace this with something specific."
5,Warren helps pastors & churches,"Purpose-Driven church, as thousands now know, is a needed call toChristian in America to be about the Father's business. Practical steps, history of his work, a willingness to say (over and over) not to copy him, but to learn what you can, and a Spirit-led record make this a must read for pastors. Churches around the world have used this as a starting point for a revival of worka nd purpose led by God. Get it!"
2,"I'm Sure It's Meant To Help, But","I see alot of churches popping up based off this book and I have even attended. But I've noticed that many are trying to be ""pop"" churches, some to the effect of making the church seem cheap. And they are all looking more to this book than the actual Bible, which should be the real insperation for church building."
1,The Bible Driven Church,"Dr. John MacArthur's new book, The Bible Driven Church, reminds us that it's not new programs or styles that makes for a successful church, but adherence to the preaching and teaching of the pure word of God. Gimmicks do not belong in the operation of the church."
2,If you want to read a history of Saddleback....,"There may be some valid, useful points in this book, however, to find them you have to wade through the history of Saddleback. While Saddleback may be a very good example of a growing church, and a very good example of successful redemption of non-believers, there are very few, if any, examples given of things that didn't work and why they didn't work. Reading this book it makes it look like Saddleback has never had any failures, that the way that Saddleback has been organized and is operated is the best way to operate a church today. There are few examples of options of doing things other than the way Saddleback has developed. If you would like to have yet another Saddleback clone, read this book and follow the programming suggestions. If you would like to grow your own church, take the information given in the book, adapt it to your purposes and create your own programming."
3,Interesting,This book is a good read to those in search of new evangelistic ideas. I must say that Rick Warren is one of the first group of pastors to bring church's into a new age
1,More Garbage by Rick Warren,"Seriously folks, somebody just HAS to stop this money hungry wolf before he spiritually rapes his flock! This stuff is just LOUSY!"
5,Post-Katrina,"This is an excellent book for any church--whatever size and whatever stage in development. The local church is a living organism and as such it's health is manifest in growth. A church that is not growing is either sick or dying. Church health (and balance) is emphazised in this text and not numbers. I belong to a once large church in eastern New Orleans that was devastated by Katrina. Rick Warren's book gives many truths and pointers on how our church can rebuild and be better than ever. The illustration in the first chapter about the movements of God being manifest in waves and us being the ""surfers"" is timely. Katrina was/is a blessing in being a rather large WAVE in this part of the country that many are recognizing and riding with joy and new purpose."
2,Not very good..,"I could only read an hour of this. I really liked, 'Purpose Driven Life' but this is hardly as good."
1,I hate big churches,"Why is everyone rushing to start big churches with thousands of members? How can you possibly have fellowship with thousands of people? I can only know a handful of people. I hate big churches with big crowds and loud, unmemorable music. There is no room for silence or getting to know anyone."
3,"""The Principle Built Church"" would be a better title","Rick Warren provides good information, but the purpose of the church is clearly to reconcile humans to God, i.e., to get people into a personal relationship with God. What Rick has identified is not purposes for the church but rather principles on which to build this ministry of reconcilation. The five ""purposes"" Rick espouses are actually building blocks for us to 1) grow closer to God 2) learn to know Him better 3) draw people to God and 4) demonstrate our love for God by loving one another. If a reader makes this transition in their minds, this is an excellent book. If not, this book can be deceiving. I give it a conditional three stars."
5,The most biblical lesson about how yo love your people,"Sorry. My English is poor...(I'm suffering now) But I can say that this book give me a biblical imotion, And my life-purpose be changed from the survival to the realization distinct vision on God's surf. In spite of my terrible English, I'm happy because I can say somthing about this lovely book. Thans to Jesus our saviour & Rick. La, la, la~"
4,Good but not unique,"I have just finished a course discussing the development of small/medium sized churches, so my estimation of the material will be slanted. Warren does not present any material that is new or unique in realm of church development literature. Many of his ideas can be found in other books or even through meditation of your churches current situation. He will express that no plan can work as a cookie cutter approach. Warren does a marvelous job of presenting a good overview of successful ideas for church growth as well as emphasizes the importance of a purpose statement. Warren seems to be a little over focused on numerical growth and people pleasing for my tastes. Overall, I would recommend this book as an overview of church growth. There are more in-depth books, but this would be a great start."
1,McDonald's theology!!!,"So now we're reduced to mega-church marketing strategies, and spiffy songs with not much meaning, and ""big is better"" ideas. What have we come to? Oh, sure, Mr. Warren is in big demand, and maybe he has a great vision, but does his methodology work in other countries, or just in this vast consumer ocean called the United States?Maybe we ought to really look at what he is asking for, and really ask the question about whether his methods are really biblical or business oriented. Madison Avenue doesn't run the church nor does ""feel good"" theology stand the test of time. There is a Scripture verse which states to beware when men think highly of you. Maybe Rick should heed this."
1,What is church GROWTH?,"Is it a numbers game to get the biggest ""crowd"" possible? I've experienced a number of Purpose-Driven churches, and though Warren's claim is that there is no need to water-down the gospel, it seems that this in fact is what I've seen happen. Though not explicitly encouraged, there is a distinct undertone running through this book recommending that churches must be made palatable and inoffensive to the unbeliever. Also, for those who've grown to love the direct and intimate exchange between yours and the Father's heart during the music/singing/praising portion of the worship service, you'll find the principles and methods for worship unacceptable -- it seems to teach that it's all right to let your congregation drink from a thimble in spite of the tidal wave God is ready to pour out on us. Let's be driven by Spirit and Truth."
4,Beautifully illustrated!,"I can finally remember all the words to this lullaby! This book, with its beautiful illustrations, is a bedtime favorite for my girls, ages 2 and 4. They love to look at and talk about the pictures, and sing along or tell the story with their own words. The end is the favorite part of these big sisters - - the baby is finally quieted when his big sister catches and holds him. I would recommend this book to anyone! It also makes a great gift for new parents!"
5,Lullaby Book,This is a favorite lullaby and this book has great pictures to go with the song. It made me smile.
5,Beautiful illustrations,"I purchased this book for my kids simply because I loved the illustrations by Marla Frazee. Her illustrations are detailed, vivid, and full of meaningful expression. I love this artist's work."
5,Enchanting and Whimsical,This is a marvelous bedtime book! The minimalistic verse (that we all know!) matches the lovely and detailed drawings. Perfect for reading aloud and for poring over slowly as well.
4,Well made kama with nylon lanyards,Very quick shipping and good packaging. The only thing that did not coincide with the advertised listing was that the lanyards were NOT leather. They are more like nylon string/shoe lace type of lanyard which should be corrected ASAP in the listing to prevent misrepresentation of the items. Also note the length of the kama is 10 inches so it may be more appropriate for a younger martial arts practitioner.
1,I concur -,"I must agree with the first two reviewers that this book is extremely disappointing. The majority of the book is a simple catalog of interfaces and methods. There is absolutely no meaningful analysis or instruction. I too had trouble getting the code to work. And a question to the floor - why in the world would one want an agent in a ""simple OLE DB consumer""?"
5,Absolutely stunning!,"I loved this book! I have read other books by Amulya and have liked them but this one is truly superior. The story is beautiful, the characters interesting and the writing remarkable. I recommend this book to everyone interested in India and who want to read a novel written not specifically for a ""foreign"" audience, but one that just tells a story without pretense."
1,Very badly written book,"First things firts.....I am clueless as to why the reviews online for this book have stars enough to fill the sky. Unless written by friends (that too, the really good and loyal ones) the book would not deserve even a 2 star. Infact I looked for 1/2 a star and couldnt find one.The narration is plainly put, silly and yada yada. Rambling without a direction and generous usage of Indian words like Chambu is totally uncalled for considering the that the target is a world audience. Amulya should read and re re re read Arundati Roy's God of Small Things to see how the soft balance between something Indian yet talking crystal clear to the Western soul is acheived. I read blurbs of the other books written by Amulya and the narrative is as Blah as it is in this one. I am not trying to be vicious here, but plain frank since the other reviews are so unreasonably off the target.A very boringly, tedious, soporiphic rambling of a book. I would not recommend this to any one."
5,works great,"works great worth the extra money to not have a cord. I have had no problems with theis product.why 20 words not sure, it works, it is compact and I forget it is even there."
3,Decent book,"Well, I saw the movie first, and I LOVED it. So I went to buy the book to see if it was just as good. Unfortunetly, I was highly disapointed. Though the story-line is good, I think Wendy Loggia could've made it a bit more creative. There were few parts in the book that the movie didn't have, but most of the lines out of the book were exactly the same as in the movie. So If i were you, I'd just rent the movie ~*Michele*~"
2,Go see the movie...,"I think you should go see the movie instead of reading this book. It does not describe setting, feelings, or emotions. You cannot see the movie in your head if you read this. The dialogue is all from the movie. The book would have done better the characters were better described. The story is supposedly the true story of Cinderella, which makes some sense. Instead of reading this, you should read Ella Enchanted."
4,a heroic cinderella story,"I really loved the movie Ever After. So i really wanted to read the book. I normally find that books are better than the movie. And It was a good book, it shows girls and women that we can stand up for ourselves and not have to wait till the end for a proper rescue. Danielle is a true heroine. But the book didn't always follow the scenes of the movie. But other wise it was great."
3,"O.K., but...","Well, the only reason that I actually bought this book was because I absolutely loved the movie. It, obviously, wasn't as good as the movie -- it didn't even come close. All I really have to say is, if you rank Ever After as the BEST movie you've ever seen, this book will be O.K. However, if you don't think Ever After (the movie) rules, I sincerely don't recommend the book."
3,Ever After,"It was a pretty good book, and made images form the movie come back to me. As I read in another review, it needed more creative dialogue and I'd give Ella Enchanted a try, if you liked this book."
3,Very Good,"I enjoyed this book very much. Even though it got a tiny bit boring sometimes, it was still a great read."
1,Buy the video...skip the book!,"After being completely enthralled by the movie, I felt compelled to buy the book and see if the magic would continue. Jeez...I could hardly recognize the drippy, sweet, and lightweight depictions of Danielle and Henry in the book as the same luminous, strong, intelligent characters that I fell in love with in the movie. For example, when Danielle beans the prince with an apple and she sees his face for the first time, her reaction is ""how beautiful"" he was--gimme a break! OK, so we get a few more details of why, how, and where things happened to fill in the blanks of the movie but honestly, it's hard to believe how the author could turn the wonderful storyline and characterizations so magically rendered by the movie into such one dimensional drivel. By the way, I love romantic novels and have bought my share but cannot recommend this one at all."
5,Best book on Kabbalah,"This is the best book in English explaining the bsics of Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism. It is not an easy read, but then, Kabbalah is certainly not an easy subject. Rabbi Kaplan has an incredible talent for explaining the most difficult and esoteric concepts in language that is comprehensible to beginners and advanced alike. This is required reading for anyone interested in knowing the authentic Jewish understanding of Kabbalah.If you're looking for a concise handbook geared towards those unfamiliar with the beliefs, practices, and guidelines of Orthodox Judaism, you should tryThe Outsider's Guide To Orthodox JudaismIt's a great gift for your ""outsider"" friend, boss, or coworker.For a book on insights and thoughts on the Torah tryDeep Waters: Insights Into The Five Books Of Moses And The Jewish Holidays"
2,Modern day B movie.,A modern day B movie filled with modern politics and characters. Probably deserves a B+ for the well created mood though for some reason it feels weak throughout. Weakness is probably due to the modern story line that spends too much time patronizing modern political views of characters making an otherwise great idea continually weak as characters take off in different directions to be politically correct. It won't matter your political view - the drive of the movie suffers from the skitso-frenetic modern political characterizations that hurt the story build as they jump off in odd directions.
5,The Pawnbroker,"Film: ""The Pawnbroker starring Rod SteigerI saw this film in the theater when it first came out in 1965, it is one of the most moving films I think I have ever seen, and Rod Steiger was fantastic in it (of course he was always a favorite of mine). I have been of late trying to locate the film as well as the book (which I never read). After reading and seeing two films based on experiences of the Holocust, Shindler's List and The Boy in Stripped Pajamas got me on my search again. As I said ""THE PAWNBROKER"" is a very heart wrenching story of the cruel nature of the ""Nazi's"".I applaud and give my deepest respect to those individuals who survived such cruelty. It also shows one to take a minute before we judge a persons manner or actions before we know what makes them the way they are.DP"
3,x-large isn't really large enough,"the costume was decent quality, but my great dane was WAY TOO BIG. i was able to make it work by cutting it up though. it ended up being pretty funny!"
5,"Bling, Bling!","It's a technics. It's gold. Not solid gold, but electroplated gold. You're paying an extra $300 just because it's gold. What more do you need to know? Did I mention that it's gold? You DO like gold, right?Oh yeah, it's ""Limited Edition"" too. So limited in fact, they've only been selling them for about four or five years now. Act fast, supplies are limited, this offer will not last long, all sales final."
3,"Great looking for price, not much punch","I bought this on sale from Amazon and it is gorgeous and has a lot of features. Playability is good but not great.Sound is definitely weak and lacks brilliance but plugged in sounds good. Tuner is very nice feature. Did I say Gorgeous? Its worth the money, but I expected a little more volume from a fairly full sized guitar. Overall a good value."
4,Underrated,"This game, I chose to wait and play until now because of the bad reviews that this game had gotten. I figured, there are other games that could be better for me to play, so I'll wait. Now that I finally played this game, I really think that this game is getting much less credit than it deserves. Sure, the game is glitchy, yes the controls are imperfect, but I still find enough enjoyment to keep playing this game. And if there are two things that I can say are perfect in this game, it's the music and the graphics. If you're a Sonic fan, I say it's at least worth giving a shot. Don't let everything the reviews say make you think that a game is bad, I learned the hard way that the only person who can say whether you like or hate a game, is you."
5,Over Hated,"Yes, I say this game is over hated. Many people are not judging this game, by loading times, and camera angles, and eventually creating a one star rating. GIVE THE GAME PLAY A CHANCE! I admit, this game has many loading times, and they are LONG. However, that doesn't mean this game is bad. give it a try, and buy it. (good game, over all)"
1,LAWLZ,"This. is. the. worst. game. ever. handsdownif you like this.. youre under 10 years old, or you have a mental handicap.this game promotes beastiality with the relationship of sonic and a human. as well as lacks any fun or gameplay.+ the camera is horrible.why sega, why?"
1,Oh god why.,"Easily one of the worst games of all time, not to mention the worst 3d sonic game. If you care anything for your relative and/or friend, do NOT buy this game for them. If you want to quickly lose said friend though, this will do that. Instead why not pick upSonic Generations? it's pretty freaking amazing, and doesn't make me cry blood."
2,not that satisfied,"i loved playing sonic the hedgehog when i was a kid, so when i saw this game i was really excited. my husband and i tried to play it and couldnt get anywhere at all. so now it sits on my stand collecting dust."
3,too many problems,this would have been a great game but there were too many problems.1. The music was not done by Jun Senoue and Crush 40.2. Sonic homing attack was too slow.3. Tails attacks were stupid throwing rings at an enemy.4. Space was wasted with town levels and extra missions.5. Not enough levels.6. Camera angles on bosses were bad.7. The bosses are boring.8. The levels divided in sections and taking too long to load.Sega needs to make a game like sonic heroes that is fast and goes from level to level with no towns. They need to eliminate the extra missions and just make a game with about 20 levels where all you do is go from the beginning to the end like on genesis and face a boss every couple of levels.
1,Bad.,"Everyone else has said it and I'll say it too. Horrible camera angles and extremely awkward controls. Load times are bad too. You'll find yourself waiting 30 seconds or more just to load a cheesy 3 second video clip followed by 30 seconds or more just to load the next stage. There are too many points in the game where you aren't really playing at all but simply pressing the jump button at crucial times and the springs and dash panels do all the rest. The game is a ""learn as you go"" style of play wherein the learning is not intuitive and you must figure it out by losing a life or two. This game is a disgrace to the Sonic franchise."
1,A waste of a trip to the video store,"Don't bother even renting this game. It is by far the worst 360 game I've played. The most annoying feature is lack of configurable controls. The X-axis camera is inverted from what you'd typically find in a FPS game, and you can't change it. The camera gets blocked at the presence of any walls, as it doesn't move toward the character when encountering obstacles.Definately do not buy this for kids. The game will only frustrate them. It has too many glitches, too many opportunities to accidently lose lives, and too many usability problems, taking away any chance of this game being remotely fun.Thoroughly disappointed"
1,save your money,"there are very few video games which lack at least one good thing to mention. This is one of them. This game is a total waste of time and money. The graphics are cheesy, the characters movements are choppy and erratic and at times they get stuck in a corner, the load time between scenes is extremely long. What irritates me most is that when starting a town mission, there is often a load screen, then a 5 second cutscene, and then another long load screen. Very very disappointing."
2,The Best Worst Sonic Title Ever Created,"One does not simply play Sonic '06.If you're buying this game, it's probably for a good laugh at how bad a video game can possibly be.I mean, let's get serious, just hop on Youtube right now and look at footage for this game.I bought it for a good, painful laugh. I hope you are not expecting more."
1,Really Horrible,"This was my first Sonic game on the 360 and it is really bad. The graphics are not much. But that's not the worst part. The game really proceeds slowly. I think there are many unnecessary loads. For example, when doing a little mini-game to get something you have to wait for 20 seconds until it loads, then some guy explains what you must do and I usually press A to skip, at once another 20 second load starts. The mini-game takes about a minute and another 20 second load. If you fail, the whole load thing starts again. The controls are messed up too as well a camera angles. Save the money and buy something else. I got so bored with this game that I just quit after couple of levels."
2,Dissapointing..,"I was very excited to get this game when it first came out. I must say that the excitement wore off pretty quickly as I played through the game. It's definitely got it's high points, but the camera angles, the scattered storylines, awkward controls, and extremely long load times kill the potential.Sonic really hasn't been the same since the Sonic Adventure games on Dreamcast, and also since the days of the Genesis..I'm hoping that the upcoming Sonic & The Secret Rings will help Sega redeem themselves.This game's definitely fun to play, but there's too many flaws."
1,Not the good old Sonic!,"I was a huge Sonic fan back when I had a Genesis. I havent played much Sonic in between, but I have a Xbox 360 and thought this game would be fun and nostalgic. The graphics are great and the cut scenes are entertaining, but overall this game is a huge dissapointment. I found myself frustrated and angry to say the least at the lack of save options, glitchy gameplay and unbearable load times. Repeating entire stretches of levels over and over becuase I cant save after one level- I have to wait until I complete 3! Well that just sucks the fun out of it. I think I need anger management classes after playing this. I've found plenty of challenging and entertaining videogames for my 360, and this is NOT one of them!"
5,awsome game,this game has the best graphics if your a sonic fan this is the game to geti got this game for christmus i have played it over a hunderd times it cheep to i like it batter then sonic generations
1,"if it aint broke, dont fix it","they keep trying to make sonic an rpg this is not what sonic is about!this is game is about as fun as watching pait dry.and a story line like some kind of final fantasy rip off but only corny as hell.. dont bother this game really really really is bad.if u want a sonic game rent sonic, sonic 2"
5,Best money ever spent!,"All six of my kids, from kindergarten to 12th grade get hours of fun from this game. It is among the most played in the house. Well worth the money; we recommend it. Most fun of all Sonic games."
1,Worst Game I've ever played,I got this game when it first came out because I'm a fan of SA2B for gamecube.-Gameplay is terrible-Load times will convince you something must be broke-The town hub is stupid and unnecessary.Please buy sonic generations instead. Great game.
1,Even Sonic Fans Won't Like This,"There's too many glitches and errors in this game, the story plot is horrible as well as the missions presented in this game. Sega rushed this game out a little too quick and that was their down fall. This game makes Secret Rings look as good as Sonic 3.Gameplay - 2/5Music - 4/5Story - 2/5The only good thing about this game is the soundtrack excluding the character's theme songs. There's better Sonic games out there, look elsewhere."
4,Decent port to Xbox,"I don't know how much you should expect out of a <$20 Xbox game that's basically a port from the Sega version. I didn't have very high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the game. The graphics on the Xbox version are better than I expected. The game is what it is...a rerun from years ago. I love these Sonic games though. Actually, I love these older Sonic games more than the newer ones that are coming out.So if you're looking for an OK game as a stocking stuffer and don't want to plunk down more than $20, this is certainly a good pick. It's suitable for any age and even keeps the adults entertained.EDIT:Just a quick update since I reviewed this item last December...I gave this item four stars last December, but that's when the price was under $20. Now that it's closer to $30, I'm not so sure it's a 4 star value anymore. If I had it to do over again, I'd probably give it 3 stars now. Who knows if the price will change again though."
2,Not the sonic I remember,"I'm biased, but I enjoyed the 2D sonic from the old days. The least they could have done was put the classics on this disc, but they didn't (I know it doesn't take much memory. They could have done it). Buy used, at a huge discount, if you are getting."
2,"Not much fun, unfortunately.","I'm sure there are people who had fun playing this installment of Sonic, the first for X-Box 360, sans the Arcade versions. I'm happy for them. I tried, I really tried. To be frank, I hated it. I didn't get too far into the game, and it wasn't due to a lack of skill. It was simply because I found myself regretting any time I wasted playing, and I was honestly bored, though that is putting it mildly. I will say it looked very pretty on my HDTV, but so did the movie Doomsday, and that isn't saying much. Cheers."
1,Worst Sonic game EVER,"Originally when Shadow came, my hatred of the franchise was of the replacement actors who badly dubbed Sonic X, there was nothing else I hated then that in Shadow, Riders and Rush which got me into getting Japanese versions only, however after playing THIS horrid thing, not even the origninal cast could make this game better.This game has NOTHING good about it. the controls are so messed up that it's more easy to die unexpectedly then it is just to get hit. the camera is at it's worst in this game making it impossible to finish a level properly. HUGE amount of glitches that ruin the enjoyment. Poor level design that make this completely frusterating, and Sonic seems to move slower then he did in past games.I would trust game reviewers when they say a game is bad, especially now, I have NEVER hated ANY Sonic game from the start until I play this."
2,A major speed bump,"For anyone planning on buying this game, forewarning: Make sure you are a major fan. Even then, a rental is advised. It is a shame that the series has plummeted to this level when it has so much more to offer. Everything from a shoddy camera, boring sidequests, cheap deaths, and repetitive characters make this one of the most disapointing titles in the series. Sure, the game isn't unplayable and even has a handful of decent moments, but even they aren't enough to save this from being a sub-par title. Make sure you are well prepared. For the fans: maybe. Everyone else: stay away."
1,Not fun - too much time to load,"I remember the fun sonic games of my childhood and decided to buy this one. It's not fun. You hardly do anything, it's all assisted. I suppose a very young child might enjoy it, but I doubt it because it takes SO long to load in between the ""fun."" Skip this one. If you want to play a Sonic game, go for the old school sega. It's way more fun."
1,Break out your old sega version,If you have this in your hands in a store drop it. Definately not worth the money. Maybe if it was 20 dollars but not 60. The original sega versions are done alot better and way more fun.
1,what's next this was whack,"This ruined sonic completely the storyline is whack the 2player mode sucks and kinda hard the way the you run and there's a space or a part you get stuck in, the old sonic games were more better with better storyline and design this game was a little off balance, so this game was'nt good at all."
1,Another mediocre offering from Sega.,"I purchased this game just to give it a fair go.Unfortunately, the issues that plague this game are, as expected, enough to drag down my opinion of the game.The largest annoyances for me are the voice acting (I have to listen to this?!) and the camera (I am perfectly capable of wielding the camera on my own).The voice acting for this game is nerve-grating at best. One thing I noticed is that I couldn't find an option to switch to the Japanese voice acting, which would have made it a little more bearable at least for a couple of minutes.The camera is agitating -- it likes to snap around and change on its own after you finally get it into a comfortable position to run along and do things. Even better are scenes that LOCK the camera after moving it to the worst angle possible.I finished a couple of stages, and just found the game too aggravating to continue.Pass on this one. Not even for a rental."
1,"Garbage, period.","I had high hopes for this game. I guess I should have read some reviews before buying it. Simply put, the quality of this game is the worst I've seen for the XBox 360. The graphics look pretty good when its not glitching. Load times are long for such short levels. The camera angles are my biggest complaint. Seriously, I couldnt see where I was going more than 60% of the time. I suppose I'll read reviews before buying another Sega game for the 360. -Scott"
1,"Good music,Nothing much else","Its a shame. This game had much potential,but due to laziness on Sega's part (IMO,this is where the crap games began) It feels like a patch,& not a true game. & the story line...very..lame. If you MUST pick something Sega or Sonic Related,I recommend either Skies of Arcadia on Dreamcast & Sonic Adventure 2 on Dreamcast (Gamecube versions of these 2 are ok,but their original forms are much better)"
1,epic fail!,".... i cant even begin to tell you the horror of this game!, the levels, the glitchyness, the way your character seemingless throws himself into the ditches or how about the lack of speed which is rediculous seeing as this is a sonic the hedgehog game!!!!. Ive been a true blue fan for over a decade now, but even i was forced to realize sega's inexcusable effort towards this game!, its unplayable to be honest with you, please dont buy this, i got this game for ten bucks, and wish i never bought it at all!!, i weep for sonic."
2,sonic the hedgehog (videogame),Its a great game but for some reason if you loose all of your lives you have to start the game completely over. I hate that! You can't start where you left off. There's no saving point!
1,Glitch mania,"This game couldve been good, had the potential, but they screwed it up, thats what happens when you rush a game before Christmas, theres SO MANY GLITCHES it makes the game unplayable."
3,Fun because you hate it.,"Let me start off by saying this game is terrible. The game is tedious and will frustrate you to no end. But that being said, you can still enjoy this game.My friends and I decided to sit down and play through the game knowing that it would be terrible and we found ourselves enjoying it because we didn't take it seriously. However, if you want a good sonic game, skip this obviously."
3,Not bad considering,"Sonic started out as what's now called classic sonic . I know everyone loved those games but I found them impossibly hard. The sonic adventure series was great but there was a lot of unnecessary levels in the first one . Shadow the hedgehog was awful but the new voices were amazing . Well it seems sega forgot how to make a good game , this was a good try . Sonic comes back with an amazing story and amazing graphics , but that's all , and the levels were HARD ! They make you wanna throw your controller . But the music was also epic . Yes this does have the same voices as sonic x . At the end I say it's barely worth it ( to buy ) . You can also say you completed one of the legendary sonic games . Also am I the only one who thinks this game should be called sonic adventure 3 ?"
3,Quick Fix: 14 year old guy with no acount,"Yeah I Don't have this game or even a 360 (so don't pay any mind to the 3 stars I gave it) but some one said that this game has beter Grafixs then Gears of War, MAN YOU WRONG, Gears of War has THE BEST LOOKING GRAFIXS OF ANEY GAME AS OF NOW.Shadow the Hedgehog is the only good Sonic like game cus You Got FRICK'NM 16's HOOWAHWii OWNS ALL"
3,Quick Review,"Malik Yoba plays Keith, a struggling journalist that comes up with a story idea. He uses the personal ads to get 30 dates in 30 days. He discovers all sorts of women until he discovers a girl (Stacey Dash) that sees right through him. What turns out to be a story idea becomes a quest to understand woman and their issues of dating.If you have seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or Never Been Kissed, this movie si sort of a hybrid of those movies. You pretty much see every type of woman out there and then some. A nice movie without the excessive sexual content."
1,CRUD DIPPED IN VANILLA VOMIT!!!!!,"Lame acting,lamer script and a been there,done thatatmosphere make this movie a must-not see!!!I will say this,Miss Cotto,the actress that playedVeronica is an amazing beauty.WOW,she is so hot!!!!!I should give this movie 7 stars just for all the skinshe showed.WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,a realistic regency that was low on romance..,"as the other reviews state, this regency tale is quite different than most regency romances. There is little, if any romantic scenes, NO love scenes, and no passion at all. This book is a book about a marriage of convienence, a ill bred albeit wealthy woman and a titled but poor man. IMO, his family behaves terribly to Susannah after she saves their lousy hides, they have no problem of pointing out that she is base born while happily spending her money. The husband acts not much better.While this behavior is certainly more accurate than most passionate regencies I'm used to-I guess I'd rather enjoy the fiction than be perturbed by reality. If you are looking for passionate, romantic, chivalry, then skip this book-2 stars."
3,Still in love,"Just a must for the title track and the follow up single ""through the tears"" she has always been a gifted singer. I had to have this to my collection."
5,"A great book from a knowledgeable, wise, and compassionate author","The Art of Getting Well, by David Spero, is a very informative, enjoyable, and inspiring book for those of us with chronic illnesses. David has included many helpful examples, from his own and other's lives, of what works and what doesn't. He describes standard and alternative treatment options for the reader to consider. He also gives many valuable ideas to help the chronically ill have better lives whether or not their condition improves. I highly recommend this book."
4,Pretty good,"I like this watch!I mainly using the stop watch when I exercising, it is really useful.Although the back light was kind of lousy, it didn't bother me that much."
3,"Not bad, but not the best either","This extremely light weight Casio sport watch seems very sturdy. The look, the design are all excellent. However, the built-in functions of waves, position of moon etc. are not reliable at all. Even the compass is not reliable. But for $19.99, I would not expect all these to save me from the Amazon jungle! Also, the 4 buttons are a little over extended outside. While putting my backpack on, I have accidentally changed the display without noticing.As I said, not bad for regular sports (even Tennis), but do not rely even 1% on it's navigational skills!"
4,Good not great,Works ok once you get the lunitidal thing worked out!Buttons are too large and have a tendency to change display without your knowledge...
4,"Good watch, better price","I like watches and when ever I take a trip I usually buy an inexpensive digital watch for the trip. The Casio was a good purchase. It has a large digital display and sufficient extra features. It also has moon and tidal phases which I will probably not use, but price was too good to pass up.Always a nice selection on Amazon."
2,Large and looking cheap,"The watch is large and looking cheap. It can be as large as Casio G-shock. The manual's disclaimer says the watch's features (i.e. azimuth angle) are not designed for real life situations (no use, for fun only). The face seems very easy to be scratched. I paid $20.19, not worth it, in my opinion."
1,A Straight Up Piece of Junk!!!,"I should have read the description more carefully, I guess! This watch is a straight up piece of crap. I has all these functions that are so useless, unless you are really interested in the Sun, moon and tides. I basically bought this watch, because I thought it looked decent and was looking for the basic normal functions. I wore this watch a couple of times and I'd look at the watch to check for time and it is showing me some mess about degrees of the sun, tides or moon! I am then having to press buttons to get back to the basic time of the day function. I would definitely not recommend this watch to someone that is looking for a nice watch to keep and display normal time and date functions!! Mine now sits on a shelf or in a drawer useles!!!"
3,Andy & Timex Review,"I really love the Timex Sports watches. I like the looks of this watch but found it a little confusing to set up and operate. It is not really user friendly. In defense of Timex, I replaced the W753-AV with a higher end Timex and love it. As For Amazon, no site better."
3,Don't get it for the tide function,"Unless you have eyes like a hawk, the tide graph is really difficult to see. The black bars that indicate tide phase are obscured by all the crud they put over the top of the display, so it's a bit like looking down into a hole trying to see little tiny black bars in the dark.The buttons are really easy to depress, so the display is always wandering around the different functions.On the other hand, I've surfed with this watch for a couple of years now, and it's still going strong."
4,Great value practical sports watch,"Great value practical sports watch. I use it for surfing, swimming and running. It's quite light and looks okay. The tide thing is accurate enough for surfers"
3,Nice cheap watch,"I own a lot of watches (something like 50 and I wear 20 of them actively.) I bought this watch as a vacation watch (I break it or lose it, it's okay.) I liked the phases of the moon and tide feature. However, in reality those features don't work so well. The Phases of the Moon works okay except the display is hard to read. The tide requires longitude, latitude and tidiludinal (or some such) setting that requires a $2.99 purchase at some surfer site for each beach you might want to visit. So, that feature is useless. The watch itself is less comfortable than other Casio and Timex plastic watches and it has a ""bad plastic"" smell to it that hasn't gone away. The back light is weak. The multi timezone feature is useless. For $17, it's not a bad deal, but if you've got a larger budget (say, $30 or $40) spring for a better watch, even if it's got fewer features."
4,Good watch,"I needed a watch to perform basic functions like countdowns, timing of laps in swimming and running etc. I have found that it was easy to set but it took a little time to turn off the alarms and set the tide function. Once those were set I have been very happy with it. It's nice to have it water resistant."
5,Perfect for the beach!,"I just relocated to the beach and discovered I needed a tide clock. Bought this watch instead of a wall mounted tide clock and could not be happier because it is cheaper and I got moon phase and compass functions as a bonus. I can wear it too! I hardly ever use my ""dress"" watch anymore. The tide function takes some time and patience to set but well worth the learning curve."
5,Solid watch,"This is a great watch. It is light, comfortable, capable of doing everything you want and looks nice. I am glad I did not go for more expensive ones !"
5,Worth the money!!!!!,It is good looking and easy to use. I just bought second one for my friend. I trust the brand as well.
4,Good Watch,"This is my primary watch.Nice simple controls, stop watch etc.was confusing trying to figure out what to input for the lunar offset, NYC's lunar offset was not in the manual, Boston's was.It is pretty solid, been smacked around alot and under water frequently. AOK.Terrific for $19"
4,Good cheap watch,"Obviously there are better watches out there but this is a pretty lightweight watch with a ""normal"" wristband that fits and holds the watch in place. The functions are limited including a very ""old"" type of watch light, a little light that comes from one corner...not your fancy type bright blue or green. It has limited functions compared to some other watches, but it serves the purpose and Casio has been making watches forever.Good cheap product that will do what it says it will do."
2,Lacklustre and uncharacterful,"I am rather disappointed by this new recording of Strauss's Egyptian Helen as the recording is musically lacklustre with uncharacterful singing.I would very much like to applaud Deborah Voigt in the title part, for her singing is wonderful secure and accurate. Unfortunately, she fails to establish a character in her performance, and all one can hear is a good soprano gliding through Strauss's vocal lines instead of being treated to the presence of Helen. Tanner is similarly two-dimensional as Menalaus, and his voice becomes harsh in quite a few places. The best sung performance comes from Shafer's Aithra, while the performances in the other roles are merely of mediocre quality.Botstein's conducting fails to please, as it is too hard-driven and lacking in subtlety. While the sound is generally good, the orchestral textures aren't made very clear. As a result, the opera comes across as rather charmless."
3,Good but not exceptional,"This is a good but not exceptional recording of Strauss's colourful opera. Deborah Voigt has the range and technique for the very difficult title part of Helen, and her performance is accurate and musical. That said, the singing doesn't have that special sense of charisma that the role requies and, at times, she sounds a little tentative. Tanner gives a wooden performance as Menalaus, but the role itself is a rather thankless one. The conducting of Botstein is mediocre, as he sometimes fails to bring the music to life. The recorded sound is acceptable."
2,Not impressive at all,"This opera stands or falls with the soprano singing the title role, and I'm afraid Debbie Voigt isn't a good exponent of the part. Her voice sounds thin at the very top, and she sings without much feeling. One wonders how such a dull Helen can kick up all that fuss!"
2,didn't like it,It is a boring chain of facts which make the book hard to read even when the subject can be fascinating
4,Fabulous,"As an art history educator - this is mandatory. Buy it. My students were fascinated and because of that they learned, learned, learned!!!!"
3,Great topic. A bit tedious.,I read this book when it came out over a decade ago.The topic is pretty fascinating.But the story moves slowly in many parts.
4,The Rape of Europa by Lynn H. Nicholas,"The Rape of Europa is a culmination of years worth of research about the systematic theft of Europe's greatest art treasures during World War II. The author, Lynn H. Nicholas, successfully takes on the mammoth task of tracing the Nazi's activities of collecting works of art deemed appropriate, and destroying or selling for profit those deemed degenerate.Despite the daunting challenge, Nicholas does a wonderful job of weaving the stories of stolen art and their owners - from the forced sales and confiscations, their movement across borders, storage, recovery and restitution. Despite it's detail, Nicholas manages to capture the intrigue and adventure of the subject matter. To this day, many great works of art have never been recovered since their disappearance during the war. The Rape of Europa is an important book for it's history and for it's relevance in the art and political world today.For more reviews, visit my blog: [...]"
4,Very Comprehensive,"While the topic of this book is definitely intriguing, it contains a LOT of information. There are so many names, committees, museums and locations, I often felt bogged down by the details when I would have enjoyed a much broader perspective instead of all of the minutiae. Overall, it is a great resource cataloguing the movement of art during WWII, the various conservation efforts taken, the unscrupulous acquisitions by the Nazis, and the tedious tracking of missing works after the war. The photographs were a great enhancement. Though I found it tedious at times, it is in important aspect of history that is still relevant to this day."
3,See the movie if you can,"After seeing the documentary movie with the same title, I was anxious to buy the book. The movie is based on the book and generally I find books preferable to movies. In this case, however, I would recommend the movie unless you are an art history major or World War II history buff. The book is a scholarly work with dense writing and extensive footnotes. While I can appreciate such texts, it was not what I was expecting since the movie is so engaging that I sat through it utterly entranced and with an intense desire to learn more."
4,Stealing beauty,"For anyone who's not an art scholar like me, this book can be a difficult challenge. But if you persist, you will be impressed by Nicholas's investigative powers, stunned by the audacity of Nazis, and perversely fascinated by the protective lengths of museums, artists, and ordinary civilians took to save their treasures from falling into enemy hands.*** The appropriation of great works of art may not be a crime equal to the holocaust of human lives, but we can begin to grasp the progression of tyranny in stolen property and the systematic imposition on everyday lives. It is a story that doesn't have complete resolution. Even today, works of art remain missing or await return to their rightful owners. Many treasures were destroyed, however, and will never return. It is a haunting echo of other, more heinous war crimes."
1,The book never delivered !,"I placed an order for this book from this seller earlier in last December. I waited and waited, but never received it even after holiday season now. As of today (Jan. 18 well more than A MONTH), athe book never came. I contacted the seller a couple of times, but they kept saying to me that it arrives shortly. Thisw seller is unrealiable."
3,Good start peters out (no pun intended),"A gay sexoholic personal trainer and sometimes go-go dancer with second sight finds a dead body on his doorstep and a mysterious computer disc in his shoe. What follows is a rip-snorting tale whose plot, once revealed, is a tad overwrought. Good writing, likeable people, but the finale suggests that Herren saw one too many of those 1930s Saturday matinee serials. Some characters will reappear to better advantage in his Chanse MacLeod detective series."
2,Feeble First Effort,"This is not a raunchy novel, though it well could have been. And, for being written in the first-person, it is convincingly told. It's about gay life (or a gay person) in the gay mecca of New Orleans. He's a go-go dancer who becomes an unwilling sleuth and catalyst to uncover a plot to destroy Sin City. He has visions through which the Goddess tells him advance events (really!). And so, a story that starts with the dancer and a trick ends up involving the FBI, the Religious Reich, pot head parents, a friend's killing, and a house burning.The story is often redundant, with the litany ""tight ass, smooth legs, and muscularly toned chest"" added twice a page or so for good measure. Those expecting a steamy sex scene will be sorely disappointed. The plot is exceedingly thin, and the bulk of it is told in fewer than twenty pages. A good first effort, but not enough to recommend reading. Still a page turner all in all."
2,Oy,"Hottie go-go boy stumbles upon a mystery and along the way finds other hot guys -- a g-man, a burglar -- as the dead bodies pile up. The cover art says it all."
2,Flat and uninspired,"Though some of the visuals were fun, overall I found the writing so flat and the plotline so hackneyed that I didn't even finish the book. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I don't want to read good writing. I was very disappointed in this book."
4,Oh my Goddess!,"Bourbon Street Blues is adorably cheesy, lightweight fun. Although as a gay man I find the main character's delight in his horny superficiality extremely unappealing (Dude! I love sex, but have another friggin' interest! Get a puppy, knit, something!) -- BUT Herren's brisk style and sense of fun win out. I really liked this one."
3,Not his best,"I bought this cd along withI'm 10,000 Years Old: Elvis Country. I thought this album,Pot Luck, would actually be good, and 10,000 a boring album. Guess what? It was the opposite. I really didn't enjoy this album as I thought I would. Not bad, but it's really a filler album in Elvis' long and vast catalogue."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is just starting on a vegetarian way of life, and would not, in fact, recommend it to anyone unless you are an accomplished chef who can fix bad recipes. I have made a few recipes in each section - appetizers, soup, main course, etc. - and found the results to be complete disasters 80% of the time. Usually the food is underspiced, overcooked, or just a terrible mix of ingredients. The few recipes in this book that have worked, like the Couscous stuffed Squash, are marred by typos. A really awful cookbook considering its source and promise. While the introductions and other information are good, the recipes do not deliver."
2,skip this book,"I've just finished making the third recipe from this book, and once again it turned out yuck. Each has had the wrong amounts( the vegetable samosas had 3 times the ammount of filling for the wrappers), or neglects key instructions (such as don't let the pumpkin ravioli touch or they will stick together horribly). Once you spend alot of time, even if it magically turns out ok, the finished product is only so-so. Stick with the Moosewood books for beginner vegetarian cooking."
2,Not worth it...,"As a teenage vegan (and beginner at cooking), I can't say 'The Vegetarian Times: Complete Cookbook' offered much to me. The ingredients are extensive, hard to find, and many are animal-based. You can put in vegan-substitutes for a lot of these, but let's face it... that usually doesn't turn out right. The preparation time was pretty long too.As far as nutrition is concerned, this book offers a calorie/fat/protein chart at the end of each recipie. Most are relatively low in calories, fat, sugar, and salt. I also thought the book was compiled well, everything is easy to find. Also, this has lots and lots of recipies...If you're vegan, just learning to cook, or at all skeptical, this book really isn't for you. 'The Complete Cookbook' puts quantity over quality and takes up an inch and a half of valuble shelf-space..."
2,it stinks,"This is a good book to give ideas on what to make, but the recipies are are not accurate. The cooking methods are strange, a waste of time and do not bring out the best of flavor in the foods."
1,Whatever happened to something that tastes good?,"The writer of this book is actually a former editor of the magazizine. it seems she looked over old, untried recipies of the magazine, added some tips (that weren't very complete) about being a veg, and just stuck them all together and called it a good cookbook.I am a college student who just turned veg. when I finally actually get time on vacation to cook something from this, my first cookbook, it really tastes horrible. And if you're just starting out, this is not the book for you, it will make you have an aversion to vegetarian foods. Plus you'll be mad that you wasted money on the ingredients."
2,not for the casual vegetarian,"This book was compiled by people who assume that if you're a vegetarian, you must be so obsessed with your diet that you're willing to spend unlimited amounts of money and time searching for ingredients and cooking in the kitchen. I was surprised that, despite all the exotic spices, this is some of the blandest food I have ever tasted. I haven't tried all the recipes yet (I haven't had time for most of them), but I'm losing faith in the odds of finding something I'll be willing to eat more than once.I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner or part-time vegetarian. It's not very easy to use, and not much worth the trouble. (And if you don't live near a health-food or ethnic food store, you will have trouble finding some of the required ingredients.)Also, the nutritional information in the beginning is not completely accurate. Vegetarianism is a healthy and ethical lifestyle, but you shouldn't have to rely on bad science to justify your dietary habits!"
2,Don't judge this book by it's cover,"Like the majority of vegetarian cookbooks out there, this one is full of ""gourmet"" recipes featuring expensive ingredients. Some of the recipes are noteworthy, like the lentil burgers, but for the most part, save your money, there are better cookbooks available."
2,You can live without it...,"My first vegetarian cookbook was no more than fifty pages long and one of those book subscriptions from Time-Life publications. That book taught me more about vegetarian cooking than the Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook. I rarely use VTCC. If I do, it's probably under the circumstances that I've lost my creativity and there isn't a piece of living room furniture that's wobbling, but even then I'll use VTCC just as a blueprint for leftovers crowding my fridge. Perhaps with the emphasis on nutrition and the efforts to depart from Non-American (actually, even American) vegetarian cooking styles, the book ends up pretty tedious and ""tasteless."" If you feel you must buy it, please borrow it from a fellow vegetarian first - they probably have it somewhere as a doorstop or something. If you're thinking of buying it as a present, take my word as a former gift recipient of the book: ""you shouldn't have, really."""
3,Goods and bads,"It's great that the book about cacao came out, as there very few of them. The pictures are great and some recipes are goodHowever, the way it's written,... I wonder what the authors were doing in Amsterdam... Raw scientific data is just taking out of context. It's all over the place, from oversimplified ideas to dry complicated scientific staff. Be consistent! Or was the editor also ""eating chocolate"" in Amsterdam :-))"
1,A Charlatan,"David Wolfe is a charlatan of the highest order, capitalizing on the new age health food craze and creating addictions out of people seeking another high.I don't recommend touching this book with a ten foot pole, unless you want to be sold on a life of addiction to raw chocolate.Not to mention his Raw Chocolate products(the only safe ones to consume, according to him) have HUGE margins built into them.A mere POUND of chocolate goes for over $25 on his site. For those who don't know, you could not find one other retailer who sells chocolate for that amount of money. It is comparable to selling a pound of cashews for $25. If you saw it in a store you would say that it is ridiculous, and it is."
1,More than I ever wanted to know...,"Naked Chocolate contains more information about cacao and the caco bean than anyone would ever want to know. If you're interested in the vast history of this bean, then this book is for you. Otherwise, read something more interesting."
2,naked chocolate,"It is just ok, but is rather simple and written very strange. Not sure I will keep it, not so good"
3,"Interesting, but flawed","Naked Chocolate presents a great deal of interesting information about the properties of cacao, its health benefits, psychoactive properties and its interactions with other natural substances. Some of its claims seem a little grandiose, but I can't say they're wrong.However, the authors overuse the exclamation point. Every other sentence ends with one, it seems! Neither the writers nor the editors seem to understand the value of using it sparaingly. Overused, it loses its impact! And if you read, as I do, paying attention to punctuation and using it to gauge the tone of sentence, reading this book is like having a conversation with an overcaffeinated aerobics instructor.That doesn't mean you shouldn't read it! Just be prepared."
5,I love these guys!,Used to see these guys all the time in Sacramento @ the Cafe Montreal. Soooooo much fun.
4,Worth the cost,Although the visibility is hurt a little bit by the sheets the protection is well worth the minor loss in image. I really like the feel that the sheets add. I find myself looking down less when I am taking quick notes because of the better texture. I would like to see the price go down a bit but...[it's] a lot better than replacing a screen
2,Expensive and annoying,"While they may protect the screen they are very difficult to apply without getting air bubbles. The texture is nice to write on but it also makes the Palm more difficult to read. I would expect a better product. Another writer had the best suggestion, if you like the texture then cut the clear cover to fit only over the writing area."
2,Not what it claims to be.,I agree with most of the other reviews that this product is more hype than it is effective. I have serious misgivings about its claims. The only one that I would not have a quarrel is that it protects your screen. As for the others they are not what they claim. One the claims are that it helps improve handwriting recognition. I did not notice any difference in accuracy. The other is that it helps prevent glare. This I found completely unfounded. The plastic sheet reduces the sharpness of the display and does nothing to improve glare. The other issue was that the sticky plastic sheets are very hard to place on the display and frequently takes many attempts in order to get it in the correct position. I would not recommend this product.
3,prepration of polishing / metal finishing composition,this book helpfull for diply enter in said trade
4,Wax eloquent,"Love this one. This movie by today's standards not only rocks but far exceeds many of today's horror flicks. The pyrotechnics are great. Vincent Price lends a stunning performance with an amusing moment. ""Smelling salts.ladie?"" The scene where he shows up in the morgue and his hooded henchman are awaiting the corpse. Super fun anytime of the year."
4,"MICHAEL CURTIZ, OPUS 91 / ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 17","HOUSE OF WAX ***Remake of the masterpiece Michael Curtiz shot in 1933. Now, 20 years later, it's 3-D, it's the worst Hollywood period in terms of artistic value and Vincent Price has replaced Lionel Atwill in the role of the mad professor. He's not bad at all here but Phyllis Kirk, as Sue Allen, is unfortunately no Fay Wray. Recommended to sci-fi and horror fans of that period.MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM *****How do I like this film! It was released in 1933 but it has a so quick pace that it seems to have been shot 20 years later. When you hear Fay Wray shouting to a policeman : ""Hey, how's your sex life"", you understand in a second that you're still in that blessed pre-code Hays period that produced so many great movies just before Hollywood lapsed into a 35 years coma. Masterpiece."
2,perfect movie,this movie maybe intorporopetie but its a fun movie i woild never get enouch of it its nothing but a perfect movie fun pictures but just because theres vilonce in this movie dosent mean that this movie sucks but im giving it 2 stars for rating very perfect movie if my friend watched it than he will watch it every day this can be on the horror channel because the actors in this movie does a graet job i have to watch it than ill be calling it one of my favrite movies i think i have to get it its like the movie freddyvs.jason i blooDy CANT WAIT TO own it on dvd
3,"Great old movie, disappointed in format","Vincent Price is always a win, even if the story is a bit hokey, but it's expected too. We were not disappointed in the movie, the transfer to DVD or the audio. All of these were very well done. However I was disappointed to see that the movie was in full screen mode. Now not being a film expert, that may have been the original format (4:3 ratio), but we also bought ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and it was in wide screen, so it was disappointing in contrast.It was pretty cool to see a very young Charles Bronson, as Igor. He was pretty buff back then!Worth the money, just be aware that this is not wide screen. It'd be nice if Amazon would note that in the description."
5,Ah Vincent Price!,"Was there anybody ever scarier? Vincent Price was such a presence in his movies.One of the first movies made in 3D, although you can't tell that from the vhs.Look for early career appearances of Carolyn Jones and Charles Bronson [Buchinsky]"
4,House of Wax,I found the 1933 early techincolor version to be of great interest. Corney in some places but Lionel Atill and Glenda Ferrel make this interesting viewing. The early color helps add atmospthere that today an editor might work to give it the surreal melodramatic look. Good fun.
4,Priceless Price!,"For Vincent Price fans, the House of Wax is a must. It is an excellent remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum.Price was often referred to as the Modern Master of Horror, and this film gives credibility to that, along with Pit and the Pendulum, Theater of Blood and the Abominable Dr. Phibes.The color was good for 1953, even with the 3-D additive.Price plays his role with passion and shows his versatility by going from the suave, laid back wax artist to the cold, calculating killer who is obsessed with recapturing his old glory, even though his hands have been rendered useless by the fire and he must embalm actual human beings in wax to make them look authentic.See Vincent Price in top form in the House of Wax."
5,Still a Scary Movie,I saw this movie at the theater and still enjoy as much today as I did back then.
4,"Great, but why no widescreen?","The transfer looks great, but I wish it was in widescreen. This is one of my favorite Price movies, so it's great to finally have it out on DVD. I heard early rumours that this would also be released in the original 3-D version. That would have been a nice option, but maybe it's something Warner Brothers has planned for later. I also like the addition of the 1933 movie ""Mystery Of The Wax Museum"". No Price fan should be without this DVD."
3,Pretty Interesting!,"This is a very strange sort of movie, but pretty good. Vincent Price is a wax sculptor with a screw loose. Watch out for Igor! (Price's deaf/mute henchman played by a young Charles Bronson, still Charles Buchinksy) Him help master dip victims in hot wax and also try to chop someone's head off in guillotine. (as you've probably gathered, he isn't a very nice character) The paddleball guy is cool too. Not a bad movie...but watch it in the daytime with a close friend."
5,Surprise!!,"I was very much surprised when I ordered this House of Wax video. It not only contained the movie I wanted with Vincent Price, but it also had the original movie with Fay Ray. Very much pleased with this video."
2,Not that big a deal,"I probably won't buy it again, because (as another reviewer pointed out) it's really nothing more than screen cleaner & wipes in cute individual packages. Sure, there's a convenience factor there, but how often do you need that kind of convenience when you're cleaning something? The wet wipe is large enough to clean about three full-sized monitors, so it really does seem like overkill for a PDA. I always clean my PDA and desktop monitor at the same time, so I don't feel like I'm wasting.I might use it if I were travelling a great deal with a laptop. Otherwise, for your desktop computer, save some money and grab a bottle of screen cleaner & an old dishtowel instead."
1,A waste of money,"This product appears to be nothing an overpriced, cutesy-named (""Brain Wash"") box of alcohol wipes. The ""wet"" wipes seem to be pretty much the same as those things you buy to clean your eyeglasses, and the ""dry"" wipes are, well, basically a napkin. As far as I could tell from using it, this product does nothing for the screen of your PDA that a small shot of Windex and a soft cloth couldn't."
1,A jumbled and mangled text,"Unlike the previous reviews, I found this book a great disappointment. The author's writing style is horrific, meandering about without focus all too frequently. Early in the book he makes reference to the military origins of the term ""fifth columns"", but is way off the mark in his reference; the ""fifth column"" was first used in the Spainish Civil War, when four Nationalist thrusts were aimed at Madrid, and the Nationalists sympathizers in the capital fought Republicans from within (hence the ""fifth"" column attacking)... This jumbled syntax is evident throughout the first half of the book, which is honestly as far as I could force myself to read."
5,Tastes Great,"We keep Clif Bars around the home all the time for a quick yet filling and more healthy snack. Sometimes hubby eats one for breakfast. The chocolate chip flavor is one of our favorites.PROS:- Decent amount of chocolate chips you can actually taste.- Nice level of sweetness.- Very filling and gives me energy.- Soft and chewy.- Provides a great serving of vitamins and minerals- Contains no artificial ingredients.- No high fructose corn syrup or invert sugar.- Contains soy protein.CONS:- Very dense, can be irritating to someone who has TMJ.- Wrapper is a bit annoying to open, never tears how you want it to.- Makes me thirsty, need a drink nearby while eating it.Overall, this is a great flavor. I like the nutritional value plus how it gives me energy. It's a must-have on a hike or really long car trip."
4,Polar S3 Foot Pod,excellent device...works accutately every time I use. The mount secures the device between the shoe laces and you don't even know you are wearing it. Great accessory to the Polar RS800 watch.
5,excelent,The product Polar S3 foot pod is excellent. Polar is a great brand and never disapoint the consumer. Very good
4,Best info on hikes in the San Gabriel Mountains,"The 1998 edition (which has updated the trails since the 1990 edition referred to in the review below) contains 100 trails in the San Gabriel Mtns., primarily in the Angeles National Forest. While it is apparent that Robinson has not visited some of the trails in some time, most of the trail descriptions are up to date. While not an excellent map, the map that comes with the book is adequate for most purposes. An excellent resource."
4,This is the Bible for hiking in the San Gabriel Mountains,"It lists all the major hikes, with complete descriptionsof how to get to the Trailhead and how to do the hike.It includes a nice map with altitude contours that showevery hike, as well as some general background on theSan Gabriels. (The USGS topo maps are still highly recommended.)The book has one glaring omission - there is no table ofhikes listed by mileage and altitude gain. Also, anupdated edition is overdue (the latest edition was publishedin 1990, resulting from hikes in 1989 and earlier).Seehttp://sd.znet.com/~schester/angeles_mtns/index.htmlfor an attempt to remedy those deficiencies.The book is still a must-have for anyone hiking in theSan Gabriels."
3,No GPS Coordinates,"The descriptions are nice, but unlike the San Bernardino mountain version of this book, there are no GPS coordinates of the trailhead. I hope the next version includes them."
5,Excellent guide,"I have an older version of this book and loved it. The guide provides historical background to the hikes which I like a lot. I can't speak for every hike but in reviewing the text, it appears revisions have been made to reflect changes in some of the trails.This book was purchased for a cousin who recently moved to Los Angeles. Even though there are other books that have more sophisticated maps and directions, the style of this text reflects my personal preference to enjoy the journey as much as the destination."
4,A charming read and useful guide.,"It is hard for me to describe this guide other than it reads as though my Grandfather were in the room telling me tales about each trail and which one I should take based on extensive knowledge. This book is not only useful, but fun to read and dispenses some great secrets about a great variety of trails. Personally I think the Author was a hiking machine, because on several of the trails his estimation for the length of time a hike would take would mean I would have to jog up and down mount Wilson. The facts and figures are accurate and the history of each trail makes you a little nostalgic for an era of Southern California's past long gone."
1,horrible service!!! I'll never order here again,"I ordered this product for delivery for christmas for my fiance in early to mid December. He received it in mid January. Their excuse was it might have been late because it was an APO address, when in reality I sent him another package that was even bigger later on in January and it arrived on the same day as the package from shopzeus. Absolutely ridiculous. To really hope that you will receive your christmas present around christmas is one thing, but to not even RECEIVE that package until a month later? HORRIBLE-this is the worst service ever-I will never order from this company ever again"
3,Thought provoking,I was intrigued by the author's approach to life and death. This was an interesting read but I seemed to want more at the end. Muske-Dukes gives you something to think about while enlisting your mind in her characters. A gentle read.
1,Less Than 1 Star,"This book gives new meaning to the word ""pretentious."" A contrived plot and clichéd characters make serious readers wonder: How did this book find a publisher?"
1,a failure,"PrameGel is a great product, I have used it for years. But, I never received it, the firm that was supposed to send it to me, never did, oh, yes, they sent a bottle of mouth wash I never ordered. This whole order was a disaster."
1,Boring!,"I saw this book at a book fair awhile ago and bought it- a big mistake. This book is -terrible-. There's no real point to it- it's just like any other vampire novel, with basically the same characters as the hundred others out there. (Not to mention the main character's a total Sue....)Terrible book. Don't waste your money."
2,A new vampire writer to review this work,"While I have hunted down this book with high expectations, thinking to myself ""OMG! a teen writer?"" However, from the first page I was skeptical. The present tense is terrible. The chapters are barely one page in NORMAL book fonting! Characters pop in, get named, and leave. There's very little devlopement, Risika seems too powerful for her time (and too outspoken! dear lord!) Aubrey is annoying, just as Armand was annoying. Ather is cool, though. Ather was the only one with any developement. I think Ms. Atwater-Rhodes needs to not worry about focusing on a million characters and focus on working with a few and a distinct mythology, storyline, etc. Bouncing back and forth between two tiem periods coudl have been done in a different way.I say we all wait before calling her the vampire queen, the next Anne Rice, and so forth! I have it in good knowledge that there's going to be someone new in the night and they'll be the next Bram Stoker!"
2,The Writer's Fresh; The Material Is anything But,"The author being 14 is just about as interesting the book goes. I must say it's quite an impressive debut for a book, especially for someone of her age. You can read about characters like these in any other novel out there, not to mention how the whole vampire theme has been overblown. Aside from that, the setting was well put. Yet, there is much room for improvement."
2,A decent first effort,"I awaited this book with anticipation since first hearing of it some months ago. I thought - so young and getting good reviews, this will be worth reading. I am not saying this book was NOT worth reading, but I didn't feel it was a spectacular as has been said. I have read many books in the genre, and several along these lines.Ms. Atwater-Rhodes will no doubt improve with age and maturity. And with any luck her stories will become a bit more original and fleshed out. Although I was a bit disappointed, I will read her next book and hope for better. You should read this one to judge for yourself.For a spectacular vampire YA book, I would suggest Christopher Pike's Last Vampire series, or Vivian Vande Velde's Companions of the Night, and Annette Curtis Klause's The Silver Kiss."
2,Vampires? I think not.,"First of all, aren't vampires supposedly SCARY? Keep-you-up-at-night, shivering-in-fear scary? Well, reviews claim this is a ""vampire"" book, but it is seriously lacking in scariness.You may pick up this book from your library, (or, in my unfortunate case, BUY it,) and you do that because you LIKE vampire stories and WANT to be scared, not played with!This book is seriously lacking good description-actually ANY description other than description of hair, eyes, skin, and-wait, that's it. That's not characterization. Characterization is mainly how a character reacts to situations and what they say or do. The characterization for Risika, the main character in the Forests of the Night, was mainly that she was a vampire holding a grudge against the vampire who had killed her brother. That's not bad, but she holds the grudge for 300 YEARS.That's a long time. Very long.Very very.Basically, this book could easily be classified as childish.Duh.It was written by a 13 year old."
2,An Unbiased Point of View,"Ok. let me explain my rating. it was not an AWFUL book. But I did not particularly like it. the way the author went from from past to present was confusing at times. And she over used a few ""big"" words to the point that it was extremely annoying. I found the main character to be bland and boring. The story itself needed a lot more life. Overall, if you're a fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes (which i am) then, read it and form your own opinin. but if you're not a fan of hers or just starting to read her books, do NOT read this one first. It is not very good. ^_^"
2,I sincerly hope that she becomes better...,"...because she does have skills but this book was an embarrassment. The book was short and the main character, Rachel a.k.a Risika supposedly had centuries of a past of which, for the most part, were absent in the book. And for Risika to be hundreds of years old, she seems to have gained nearly no wisdom or greater knowledge than when she was a teenager in the 1700's. She may be immortal and her physical appearance to be the same as that she had years ago, but her mind has to have developed in some way. On the other hand, the style Amelia Atwater-Rhodes uses is poetic and very easy to follow. Also, the dark atmosphere was well constructed. I liked Aubrey as a character and the fight scenes between him and Risika were okay, though short. So there's the two stars-for her style of writing and some action between two okay characters. Go read it and think about it anyway you want. Luckily, the paperback version is out."
2,Two Stars. One for her Age. One for Getting Published.,"Well, kudos to the young author for writing a novel at her age. She is an inspiration. And deserves all the publicity she received. And way to go in even getting taken seriously by an agent and a publishing company. Those are her two stars! What an amazing accomplishment.But alas, it's a real world out there. There's not much in this slim volume to get excited over. You never get a sense of why the main character is so bitter and has held a grudge for 300 years. And why now after all this time does she decide it's time to act upon it? What was the spark that led the events of this story to take place? And please remember, you can't wrap it all up with a surprise in one page at the end.Reading about vampires is always fun to me. But a book has to come from somewhere and lead you somewhere.Admirable."
3,"It's a story, not a bible.","Okay, so maybe the girl's a rip off Anne Rice, and maybe she does contradict herself a few too many times, but the quality of the actual writing is extraordinary. Ignore the weak plot and enjoy the prose."
4,In the forests of the night,"Risika a 300 year old vampire remembers her past as a 17 year old human. She remembers the events leading up to her being turned into a vampire and the actual event. She is bitter that her humanity was taken from her in such a violent manner. Risika is out to get Aubrey, another vampire, and her arch enemy, whom she thinks killed her twin brother, Alexander, 300 years ago. Risika questions her strength and powers thinking that Aubrey is too strong for her to over power. The novel shifts smoothly between NOW and the early 1700s. A fast paced teen fiction vampire novel which is different from most in that the main character is a vampire not a girl in love with a vampire. This one was hard to put down. I wanted to find out what happened next."
4,In the forests of the night,"A good teen vampire fiction novel. Different from many in that the main character(Risika) is the vampire not a girl in love with a vampire. We get to see things from a vampire's point of view. Risika is 300 years old and is out to avenge the death of her twin brother Alexander whom she thinks was killed by Aubrey, a vampire and her arch enemy.Risika doubts her strength and powers and only challenges Aubrey after receiving a black rose similar to the one he gave her 300 years ago.It was a very fast read that has a suprising ending."
4,"Basically, I am saying that the book was fantastic.","Hello, My name is Patrice French and I read your book called ""In The Forest Of The Nights. Personally, I think the book was very adventerous and stimulating. I also think it was a very intruging book. When I heard a 13 year old girl wrote a book, it aspired me. I read this book in my 7th grade reading class. The only problem I think the book had was the ending. I think you could have down something else more adventerous. Other than that I loved it. I think you have a talent to write and I think you should write more books. Sicnerely, Patrice French (P.S. I adored the poemd called ""The Tigers Eye"")."
3,....,"when i first purchased this book and read it, i barely gave it a passing thought and moved on to the next book. however recently i decided to pick it back up again and re-read it. while not the best book i have ever read, it is a very well written, and very poetic. amelia atwar-rhodes portrays the story of a vampire who struggles to find a way to balance the past and the present, her humanity and her vampiric instinct. flashbacks of her struggle to accept what she became and fighting to stay free in the present make this a very intresting read."
5,amazing,"this is a remarkable book. it is about a vampire named Risika, and her archrival, Aubrey. they fight for power thoughout the book, and when aubrey hits one of risika's soft spots, she gets fed up and goes to avenge her friend and brother. this book has a surprising twist, and you can pick it up a week after you finish it and read it again because it is so good. i reccomend this book for anyone who loves mythological creatures."
4,impressive. . .,"The book had amazing descriptions and ideas. I was a little confused at where the book was going. To me it didn't seem like there was a definitive plot line. The story line flowed well but I wasn't sure exactly whether this was a story about Rifika's existance and how she came to be or a story about her conflict with Aubrey. (I honestly think it was both) GREAT job, Amelia. If you as good a writer as you are now, I can't wait to see some of your later books. If you liked this book definately check out Demon In My View."
1,"Little plot, unoriginal....nice style","The ONLY credit I'll give this book, is that the author has a cool writing style. It's poetic. I'll give it that. However, style doesn't make up for an unoriginal plot, undeveloped characters, and not enough description. In things like vampire novels and fantasy books, it's vital that there is plenty of description so that the reader comes to understand what this world is like. This book doesn't give enough. Also, it seems that the author tries to force themes. I don't think that these problems in the book have anything to do with the author's age, you're never too young to start writing, but she needs to start working on her plots. There are plenty of better books than this one."
2,...,"I just read In the Forests of the Night, and I think it lacked something. There were some things that were unexplained, and the very ending was disappointing. Hopefully Ms. Rhodes' books would be more well-written. I wonder how the hype would have been like if this book was written by an adult. Would it considered great, satisfactory, or horrible?"
5,I Couldn't Believe It Was Written By a Girl My Age!,"I thought this book was so good. It captured my attention very quickly and held it until the end of the book. I loved Risika, the main character, and the way that there was a mystery hidden in the past. It's an excellent book, and I could not believe that it was written by a girl my age!"
1,This reads like a 16 year old wrote it...,"...which is a compliment, I suppose, considering she was 13 when it was penned. It's actually quite impressive for such a young woman, but the sheer wall of angst, the repetitive use of such overdone terms as good, evil and innocence, not to mention 300 year old creatures who react like high school students when approached with conflict...well, suffice it to say that the high rating this novel has received overall leaves me baffled. The tone, conflict and resolution call out the author's adolescence. I suspect in time, as she gets more life experience, she will be quite good at the craft, but for now? Not so much.If you are in high school yourself, this might be a good read. Otherwise, skip it. There's plenty of YA lit of high enough caliber to appeal to adult sensibilities. On the plus side, this is an extremely short book, so you won't waste too much of your life if you feel the need to actually complete it."
4,"A wonderful, imaginative book","Being a teen myself, I was interested in what someone my own age has to share. Upon reading this book, I was impressed with her imagination. She developed a protagonist that readers can feel for; one can easily see Risika as a seventeen year old girl prowling the streets of New York, but this is where that innocent image ends. She speaks of the world in a language that goes beyond an age that any human can imagine. Amelia's creations: New Mayhem, the Triste witches, and the vampire clubs, are a product of true imagination. Amelia goes beyond the ordinary vampire myths and legends that so many have written about, and developed a world of vampires that is truly her own. I was slightly dissappointed in the ending, but hope that I will see more of Risika in more or Amelia's books. The author truly has a talent that will only bloom more with time. She has set an example for teens all over: they, too, can set something free into this world that is great."
4,Wow! great stuff for any age writer,The smooth flowing fast moving text kept me entranced... I couldn't put it down. What I find most interesting in this vampire teen fiction novel is that the main character is a 300 year old female vampire. In other teen fiction vampire novels I've read (The Silver Kiss; and Look for me by Moonlight) the main characters are girls who fall in love with vampires.Risika (formerly Rachel) is a 300 year old vampire whom is trying to avenge the death of her twin brother Alexander over 300 years ago. Risika tries to keep morals she was brought up with as a girl in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This is almost impossible for her to do however now that she must kill humans to survive.
3,Pretty darn good for a first timer!,"I actually read this book thinking that an adult wrote it, then I read the back and my eyes bugged out when I saw the age of the author! The book was pretty well written, but left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. The story could have used a bit more depth and thought, otherwise it's nothing to sneeze at."
4,Pretty good.,"This is the first book that I have read from Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and overall I think she is a great writer. This book is a YA book. However the dialog the character projects is actually more mature. There wasn't any drama, that you get from a YA book. The main character may have been a teenager, but the author presented her as an adult. So it was very interesting to detect all of the differences between this book and the other YA books I have read from this genre. I will say this, however, the vocab in the book is not as advanced as some othe novels, but the author was very young when she wrote it, and you probably would be too wrapped up in the story to care. I was. So overall I give this book a well earned 4 stars."
4,Giving Credit....,"Everyone is buzzing about the 13 year-old girl who wrote and published this book. As it turns out, the praise is well-deserved.Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has entered the often copied realm of vampire fiction. While she adheres to the elements of the genre that are so popular (the romanticism, the struggle between morality and hunger, the dark escapism of the night), she also strays into her own territory and gives her vampires fantastic new powers. This book, being her first, is also her weakest writing attempt. Maturity improves each subsequent book after this one. I highly recommend reading the series. The author, while young, has a knack for capturing the inner voice of her characters and is a wiz at writing ear-catching prose. An excellent start to a series that is becoming great."
4,Very Nicely Done!,"This book is both poetic and intriguing, one of the best first-time authors there are. The poem in the beginning is a nice touch (and yes, I do realize she didn't write it). The flashbacks only add to the book's deep plot as a vampire, Risika, deals with human mortality issues. As Aubrey, another vampire, enters the scene, he threatens everything she believes and her one love: a tiger called Tora. This book will keep you reading until the breathtaking climax and deeply felt conclusion."
3,She has potential.,"FORESTS is the story of a young female vampire from the seventeenth century. Three hundred years jaded, she finds her only solace and kinship in a caged tiger at the zoo. The chapters alternate between recounting her vampiric origins and her current life (such as it is) as she prepares for the inevitable final conflict between herself and the longtime foe who murdered her brother.At just under 150 pages, the plot is slight. While the heroine does have a destination in mind, I didn't feel like there was much progress until the end. Then, there is a twist in the tale that doesn't make sense.Whether it's fair or unfair to take the author's age into account, it really can't be ignored. Rhodes was thirteen when she wrote this book, and for that, it is impressive. It's even not bad for an older, more experienced writer. Its intended audience, who will no doubt go on to reading Anne Rice novels, should enjoy it."
3,"I will buy the next book, but...","I am not sure about this one. It reads very fast - not so muchbecause it is enthralling, more because it is spare and lacks realsubstance. In addition, it was quite short, and the author certainly contradicted herself a few times.That said, I enjoy and support almost all fantasy, horror, and supernatural tales. And I believe that Amelia will improve with age and experience. So, read this book. And her next one! That way, you can form our own opinions. *smile* END"
2,Maybe the next will be better,"Was it just me or did anyone see that this book lacked a lot? First off, the length of the book was way to short for the story. It seemed to be rushed and simplified. The style of writing was nothing that can stand out in the Young Adult genre (very similiar to Anne Rice's over dramatized style). And the story was the same old vampire-point-of-view tale. I don't really want to start on plot holes, but I will. I lost count after about page 70 on how many times I fell into one of the many plot holes. On a final note, I would like to say that Rhodes will hopefully mature and become more creative over the years. And I am looking forward to see what she has in store for the next novel and will read it."
5,Brilliant and Beautiful,I thought this book was spectacular. I loved it and as an aspiring teen writer myself was very impressed.
5,Excellent first novel!,"I saw an article about Ms. Atwater-Rhodes in the June issue of Seventeen magazine and I marvelled at a fourteen year old who has a published novel. I then checked the reviews for the book on amazon.com and decided to get the book as soon as it came out. I was not dissappointed! I love reading Anne Rice's books and other vampire and/or witch novels and this was another book to add to the list of great ones. It was interesting how the author weaved in parts of her own life living in Concord, Massachusetts. Don't be fooled by the author's age. I just turned 21 and I enjoyed this book. I deffinately recommend this book and can't wait for other novels by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes."
4,What a beautiful book!,"I was prepared to cut this book some slack, being a first novel by a young teen....but found myself falling in love with the writing and honest storytelling. There were a few weak moments, but hey, it's a first novel. The writing was truly lovely and I'm recommending it to everyone of all ages."
4,"Good, not great","There are good and bad things about this book. If one were to dismiss the fact that the author was a teen and just review this book like any other without any 'special' exceptions, I think that it would come to four stars. Star number one is for style. It fits and it works. Star number two is for characters. Not cardboard- cut outs, but not exactly three dimensional either. Star number three is for action. It's not explosive, but not cheesy either. Finally, star number four is for plot. The plot may not be complex, but it's at least understandable. The missing fifth star was for the addition to vampire lore. Adding in the mind- power stuff almost made me forget that the characters were vampires... they are, aren't they? So once again, age is not part of my review. There are some forty- year old authors who write the same quality books as Amelia Atwater- Rhodes. I will keep on reading this author's books, but I will also keep in mind that there's better literature out there."
5,EXCELLENT!,This book reached far back into the mind of the surreal imagination and combines it with the dark fantasy of the yearning heart. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is an excellent author for creating something so tempting to read. She did a superb job of feeling what the character felt and being very descriptive. Everyone should read it!
4,Scary Things That Bump In The Night,"I thought that this was a well written book.The chapters are short,yes. However I thoughtthe story line waseasy to fallow and fun to get into.I think it would be a good introductionfor a young teen or someone even younger.Who wants to start reading horror novels.Without being scared to death.The characters are very real and I liked the authorsvocabulary and setting."
4,Review,"Mike TruaxMiss HalkovicLanguage Arts12-3-03The book, In the Forest of the Night, I think it had a great story line all the way through. I also think it had a great ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action packed thriller stories. I find it amazing that the author, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes was only thirteen years old when she wrote this book. I think she has a great vocabulary and punctuation for her age. I would live to read the other four books in her series because I was very interested in it."
3,It wasn't really what I expected,"I picked up this book, hoping for a good read, but found myself not very interested in it. I am an avid reader, especially horror novels, but I found this book to be seriously lacking in some areas. As someone else said, it is a fast read, but I found myself just trying to finish it. Risika seemed to be a very flat character and nothing she did (thoughts or actions) came across as believable. The writing itself wasn't well done and it didn't flow because of too many short choppy sentences. In my opinion if Ms. Atwater-Rhodes hadn't been 14 years old, the hype about this novel wouldn't have been as big because it wasn't that great a book. Maybe her next book will be better."
2,Not great!,"It is like all the other vampire books out there and it kinda wasn't that great. I think the only reason everyone is reading it, is because of the author's age. The book wasn't original."
3,"Brooding, hypnotic; good escapist fare","This book can be rather hypnotic in its brooding tone, especially after Midnight. Though spartan in its details, one can easily ""feel"" the events as they're played out across the pages. Miss Atwater-Rhodes deftly conveys the emotions of a lone vampiress still stinging from her transformation 300 years ago, at the zenith of her adolescence. This is a short book which can be consumed in two or three sittings. But you'll be thinking about the story for some time thereafter."
2,"A solid first effort, but more potential than skill","This book is a good first effort for any author, but it does have some weak points that may disappoint avid vampire readers. Focusing on the usual topics of transformation and the nature of evil, the story is simple and the characters somewhat shallow. Overall, the story feels like a good introduction to these characters and their world, but it doesn't provide enough depth in characters or plot to be very satisfying. Although the plot is quickly and tightly paced, I would have enjoyed a little more time spent exploring this book's characters and themes--the story felt too sparse (almost rushed-through) in some areas. The author does show a very good amount of potential in her writing, but one has to wonder if this book was published solely because of the story's merits, or because of the public relations novelty of a fourteen-year-old writer."
3,... *cough*,"Yes, I know that most people would think that this is amazing for a thirteen-year-old, but to be honest, I've seen better from peole even younger than her. And, this book wasn't even published until she was like, fifteen. Sure this book was ""okay"", but I think she could have done way better. Still, this is probably the best book she has ever written, as the others really do suck (and have you noticed that all of her novels are about really pretty seventeen-year-old girls that turn into vampires at some point or another? it's pretty cliched). If your going to read any of Amelia Atwater-Rhoades at all, I'd suggest this one. I've read all of her book except Hawksong, and not even because she was good, but because I figured she'd get better, and I was curious of how she would portray the vampiric world. But really, you'd probably be better just skipping this book and picking up ""Twilight"" if you want to read a good vampire book."
4,"Very very good, could have been longer","I really think this is as good a story as anyone could have told, and told as well as anyone could have told it. There were no missing plot elements, and the characters were fully formed. I think if the novel had been about twice as long it would have been better, because the story leaves you REALLY wanting to know what's going to happen next. To call this a ""novel"" is a bit of a misnomer...it's more of a novella; 150 or so smallish pages. Took me about 3-4 hours or so to read it at a casual pace. It stings a little to pay $10 (with shipping) for a book that short...I really hope she continues writing...can't wait to see what she comes up with next."
4,Could be better,"I'm 12, and writing a novel (the main characters are named Kysentha and Tirahn, be sure to look out for it when it's published!). I read this book 4 days ago, and it was good. However, it was a short for me, and i prefer books that have approximately 200 pages or more. It was good for a teen writer, but it was a little lame (sorry, amelia! if i insulted you, you can insult me back on my novel). The interesting parts were the black rose, rachel becoming a vampire, and rachel and aubrey's bad terms with each other. It wasn't very scary. The ending was lame, because there was practically nothing. I expected risika to kill aubrey, but she didn't. But still, it's amazing how a kid can publish a book like this."
5,Greatest Thing I've read,I really enjoyed this book. It shows the character change from naive and innocent to predatorial and guarded. I recommend this book to all young adult readers.
1,And People Rated This Well?!?!?,"Ugh. This book was possibly one of the most childishly written books I have read since I was decided to read Spy X: The Code (also not a good idea to read)! It took me about an hour to read it and it sucked. Alot. You couldn't really get what was going on until the middle of the book. I mean REALLY, who would think that a book could be written so poorly. Not only was it not straight out scary, but it wasns't even vaguely creepy. DULL, just dull. I wanted to rate this well because it was written by a thirteen-year-old who hadn't ever published anything before, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it."
1,Worst book I ever read,"This was THE WORST book I have ever read in my entire life. First of all, it was way to short for me. I read it in a little over an hour. I felt as If I had just read on of those 3rd grade reading level books. Second of all, this is the most UNORIGINAL book I ever read! Its like the author read a few vampire novels and rewrote them in her own words, which arenot that great. I swear there is not one original idea in this entire story! Third, the story is not that great at all. Many parts are just well, dumb. There is maybe 1, possibly 2 interesting parts in the book. Trust me, this book is not worth buying or getting out of the library."
2,double check,"In the Forest of the Night is as easy to follow as seeing in the pitch-black night. This book just needed that extra POW to it. Its about three girls that are trying to free a Bengal black striped tiger which is a bit unrealistic. They almost get caught. They try and act like spies, although there is not much action. They try and try to free the tiger, and when they reach success it feels so good but they feel guilty because they took the tiger from the other people. This book is a two star book. I wish I had read the title twice. Before you read this book read the subtitles and see if it interests you. **"
3,Could of been a lot better.,"It could of been a little bit better. Make that a lot better. She has the talent of writing, that is very obvious, the only problem is she's using her talented ability's to write stuff that's already been done. This book, in the forests of the night, was a copy of Christopher Pike's last vampire series. Also, I think that she's created her own world, and, although it's a cool one, it still has flaws and non-believable holes which stick out. I think that she herself has created a bunch of work for herself, and although she tries to live up to them and make them flawless, she is unsuccessful.Anyways, check this book out at the library, don't buy it. It's not worth it."
1,Clearly the work of an amateur,"Frankly, if I had not known anything about this girl, I still would have known that this was written by a kid. Just by reading it you can tell because traces of her immaturity tend to show up in her writing. For example, too many of her similes are unnecessary and certain aspects were not believable. She leaves certain points in her book unresolved, which makes the ending a little confusing. I was a little dissapointed by the fact that her main character's angry vengeance was in vain and only a simple misunderstanding. These are mistakes no true professional would have made. I was appalled by the fact that many of her reviewers were giving her book five stars. For goodness sakes, don't lie to the poor girl! If everyone tells her that she is a great writer then there will be no room for improvement, something that is much needed. Although she has alot of potential,she still has a long way to go."
2,There just wasn't much to it.,"I read this book with high hopes, but it left me feeling flat. There simply wasn't much substance to this book, and I found myself disappointed. The plot was light, the characters not particularly well developed, and the story was inconsistent. But, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and some people obviously enjoyed it. ;)."
2,"An admirable start, but...","I don't read vampires at all, so I can't really consider myself very well qualified to judge this book. However I am an avid reader and an aspiring writer myself, so here goes. The plot was good, a bit clichéd, but well done clichés at the least. The characters were very original and I believe what carries the book. The actual writing, however, I wasn't very happy with. There wasn't really any ""meat"" to the story; I read it in five hours from cover to cover. It felt very sparse. I was disappointed, I have to admit, but I'm not discouraged. I'm going to buy her next book, I swear it, and her next after that because at fourteen she is a mature and obviously very skillfull writer and I can tell you honestly... in the future, she is going to be *darn* good. (I'll become familiar with vampire lore yet...) One annoying thing about the story, though: she contradicts herself. The cover is pretty."
4,A really good book...,"This book was REALLY good. It even made me start a book of my own about vampires...its not finished yet. Anywayz...this book really gives ya that feeling where you can't put it down. A friend let me borrow this book because i needed one... my language arts teacher was grading one of those participation/ reading grades and i had forgot my book at home. Im glad i asked. Too bad Amelia only wrote 3 books. I read this one and ""demon in my view"". I can't wait to get ""shattered glass""! Actually, its just my opinion, but...i really think ""demon in my view"" was much better than this one...not that i dont like this one, i really enjoyed this one...its just that the other one involves alot more characters and events that are a lot more exciting. So you should read that one, if you havent already. Anywayz...the point is ALL her books are ausome and youve really got to read them ALL to enjoy her unique writing.~Sarah~"
2,Mediocre,"The book was okay for a freshman book, could of been better. There's just no depth really there. She really doesn't connect with her characters nor does she with the readers. The ending was just there."
4,mUsT rEaD!!,"This book is exhilarating, much better than I percieved. It is a pretty quick read, which was good. This book is about Risika, a human-turned vampire. Risika was changed into a vampire about 300 years ago, but hasn't aged a bit since. She still looks 17 years old. At day, she stays in an old manor in Concord, Massachusetts. By night, she prowls the streets of New Mayhem, sometimes daring enough to go into the territory of her enemy, Aubrey. In The Forests of the Night diminished the assumptions that I had about vampires, such as their fear of crosses, and the disappearance of their reflection. As time goes on, vampires' reflections fade, but there is still a faint reflection. This novel was an exciting, easy-to-read page turner that makes the fictional world of vampires realistic and believeable."
3,Good read but short!,"First of let me say how basis i am because i love amelia at-water rhodes books shes one the the first authors i read when i was a teenager and i still read her books till this day and im an adult now! This book was a little different it switchs between the main characters past and present time, at first it gets confusing but once u get the hang of it u start understanding how it works! I liked the book a lot but didnt love it! But cant really say much she was only 13 when she wrote it! Sadly the book is short but i enjoyed my read! It would be a good start off book to someone in their early teens! i recomend the books because it just keeps getting better."
4,Great start for a young writter,"I thought this was a great book. I being a young writter myself, and the same age loved it. I first heard about her on The Rosie O'Donell Show, and was not sure if I was going to read it or not. I found it the book store, and saw that it was the last copy. I jumped for it, and have not been able to put it down since. Even if you are not a fan of this type of book, I recemend reading it. It is not every day you find a 14 year old with talents like hers."
4,Pleased,I was very pleased with the quality and workmanship of this shoe. It fit comfortably and I can't wait to wear it out.Fortunately I took the advice of the first reviewer and ordered a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear. Good decison. I think the fit would have been too snug if I went with my usual 51/2. Thanks for the tip.
1,Don't bother,This is a slapped together piece that offers very little.Get word of mouth or anything by Pat Fraley instead
5,The best Christian fiction that I've ever read,"I was so moved by this book, I am nearly at a loss for words.Fire of Heaven, by Bill Meyers, is not just an engaging story....it's story and characters illustrate the ulimate level of commitment to Christ and God that we must attain to break the chains of this un-Godly world, and the utter joy to be found when someone is successful.Highly recommended!"
4,Note: You only get 1 model for $9.99,"The above description reads as though you get the 6 models. This is not so... You get 1 and it is whatever they send you. The first time we got the tooth and gum model. The second time they sent the chest model.The item itself is in a red translucent box, a little bigger than a Rubik's Cube. It is pretty weighty, which leads me to think that it is of a higher quality than I thought it would be. I have not opened the red box, because I bought this as a Christmas present. I wish it had been sold as a set or individually with your choice of model. I probably would not have picked the ones I received. But who knows maybe my son will really dig the tooth model;)"
5,Definitive and well researched,"Rarely does a book change ones outlook - indeed one that does could be said to be very important. Dr. Grady's book has been to me very important. It has strengthened my faith in God and in his inerrant nature.One of several excellent books on the subject of the authorized KJV the author has done a good job of mixing documentation with practical application and understanding. Having myself comitted portions of the NIV to memory over a period of ten years - I was somewhat skeptical of the ""KJV only"" position and Dr. Grady's book. After reading this book, I realized how incomplete and polutted the other translations are - I swapped my NIV for the KJV and won't be going back!"
5,Great Book on the King James,"Anything Bro. Grady writes will be well researched and thought out. While Bro. Grady may come across as caustic to the soft - and easily offended, I thoroughly enjoy his rancor.Steve Mays"
3,Most of it was interesting but parts I didn't agree with...,"A very well written book regarding the KJV, its beginning and the men that God used to bring it together for the English speaking people. God is in charge of his word not man. He promised to preserve it and he did in the KJV."
1,Grady Guilty of Misrepresentation,"Although Grady writes with a very convincing style full of quips and clever puns, misrepresentation pervades the entire book. He misrepresents history, opinions of other people, and the facts of the KJV-only debate. His book is a case-study in classic KJV-only rhetoric. If you want the truth about the KJV, steer clear of Grady."
2,"One more reason not to be a ""Fundamental, Independent, KJV only"" Baptist.","It is sad that such a condescending and sarcastic spirit prevails in this book, regardless of it's accuracy/inaccuracy.How many thousands have been saved from sin all over the world having been preached the truth from other versions besides the KJV?It makes me sad that the world views fundamental baptist as unloving, abrasive wackos.The bible--love it--believe it--love the Author more."
3,RUCKMAN-Nesque!!!,"I loved the doctrinaire tone of this pugnacious, fightin' fundamentalist. There are a few revelations about Wescot/Hort you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere, and the study in providential preservation, i.e. HOW we have a perfect copy of the Scriptures in English this very DAY is enough to make a Five-Point-Calvinist jump back on the REAL reformed text in his precious Greek! HIGHLY recommended at a good price. Hear the Doc (Grady - sorry Peter!) read it online, too!!"
2,i thank God for a man that gets angry,"im sorry for you people who dont like the tone of this book.if i found out that i was decieved all my life i would be angry and every time i thought about (or wrote)it, my tone would be just like bro. grady's. harsh, unforgiving. once you read the kjv for any amount of time ... and then you read the ""other"" (per)versions... you will see the differnce.also.. if you a close to God.. you should be able to recognise your father's words. and its the words not the ""thoughts"" that matter.this is a great book... fully backed up... written by a great man of God... Thank you Jesus for this great man."
1,Better Than The Bible,"This book is much better than the King James Version of the Bible.Which makes Dr. Grady a Nicolaitan and his book blasphemous.Accordingly, Christians should not read this book."
2,"Almost as bad as Riplinger's book,","This book has a lot of interesting information, however as others have noted, he sometimes get's away from the subject at hand.Also, his ""research"" is about as bad as Riplinger's was in her _New Age Bible Versions_ book (it's also on Amazon). Yes Westcott and Hort were liberals, however he just several others blatantly misquote them to make them sound even worse than they were. For a valuable rebuttal to this book, I would suggest Dr. James White's book, _The King James Only Controversy_."
4,Emerging from the underground street scene,"I This this was a very underrated album. I wish they recorded more albums. Their classic Livin' In Da Bottle deals with alcohol madness. Cee's rhyming style sticks to the subject matter and cleverly uses metaphors. Others to look out for are To The Head, Ruffneck Style, Gettin Money and I love Loosey's. very good 1st effort. Recommended."
1,terrible.,Had a problem with toes rubbing together. Didn't work. Doesn't stay in place. Waste of money! Wish I had never bought it. Buyer beware!
3,Great spacer but warps over time => discomfort,"I got these toe spacers because I had to wear a compressive bandage for plantar fasciitis, which is not great if you have a neuroma (nerve impingement between two toes). At first they solved my problem perfectly, but over time (a few weeks), the spacer warped and by the end of the day was very uncomfortable because it sort of slid under part of the toe and rubbed. I tried wearing it upside down but they're really shaped to be worn one way only. I don't know if this would not have been an issue if I had a larger foot (I'm a woman's 6.5-7), but I basically had to switch to another product: Footsmart Hourglass Gel Toe separators. They're not perfect either (sometimes my toe aches by the end of the day), but they're more comfortable and don't rub."
2,Too hard to get a good fit,"This product probably works ok if your toes are built exactly a certain way and very, very close together. However, my toes have spaces between them - like most toes - and these little things never stayed put despite my repeat attempts. By end of day, they had all migrated to other places in my socks, causing an irritating need to remove shoes, socks and then remove them. I wish they had worked for me, but they didn't."
1,Falls Out,"From the picture and description, I thought for sure this was a pair of pieces, each with four separators attached. Hence ""U-shaped."" Instead, what you get is 8 individual flaps, not very u-shaped at all, and with no way to keep them between your toes. They are very thin. Even if your toes press together hard (which is the condition this product would ideally treat), it will just squish out.It sort of provides relief if I carefully hold the pads in place, but that in itself is stressful.I just tried doubling up (using all 8 pads on one foot) and it is working well. Too bad I can only do one foot at a time. If I have to buy an extra set to accomplish what one should do, it still gets one star.I see that the product page has been updated to reflect that there are 8 pieces... But looking at the order I placed, it did not say that at the time."
1,They do not stay in place,"I tried these with bare feet, with socks, and with shoes and socks, but they don't stay in place. If your toes naturally touch tightly together, then maybe they would. I spent $65 to get Correct Toes instead, which stay in place better (but not perfectly)."
2,WAIT FOR FootSmart2 !!,"Salam (Peace),I usually rate for some detail, and it may not effect the actual ""rate product"".Details of the product : 4/5Price of product : 3/5Shipping and Handling : 5/54 Weeks after use : 2/5I like the idea, although its hard to keep the TPE gel stay between-toes. Even when wearing a sock that fits perfectly!I would like to wear it when ever I'm walking, but its imposable if you are wearing a sandals.It might help a lot if its bigger; or maybe a string that can keep the TPE gel stick between-toes.I would give it another shot if there is a new idea thrown into it!"
2,They fall out.,"They fall out walking, running, playing tennis, etc. They just don't work. If you just sit around, they'll be fine, but these are not made for movement."
2,Not for big feet,"I wear size 13 shoes. I have an issue with in grown toenails including on my big toe. I thought something like these might keep the toes from rubbing together resulting in further irritation. However, even the two large ones only reached about 2/3 of the way from the base of my toes. And they are relatively thin so would not stay in between my toes. Even wearing socks, after a few steps the toe separators did not stay in place. The smaller ones are completely useless for me. They might work for someone with tiny feet."
2,why not a full cd?,"What's up with MSI releasing a live CD? They should have made a full studio CD. There are very few new songs on this new CD, so it's really not that great. I would have been much happier to have 10 brand new songs than 6 new and 4 live versions of old songs. They could have done so much better!!"
5,Live and Loud,"Anyone who likes MSI will want to get this cd. It is a departure from their earlier music. This recording features more guitar and is alot harder. It features 10 tracks of new and classic MSI. Including the rare ""Panty Shot."" This is also one of the best live albums I have ever heard. It was mixed very well. It sounds like a studio album but with an audience to be mocked.Get FGWSSS and get this."
3,"It looks okay, Instructions and parts list are terrible",Two pieces had damage to the finish. Parts list and instructions reference parts that don't match what's in the package. I would not buy a Coaster product again and certainly wouldn't recommend their products.
4,Kraftwerk on your mind,"Fantastic take on classic songs. You dont have to be a fan of Kraftwerk to ""get it"""
1,Hardbodies 2 - Garbage,Garbage - insult to the original - Released just two years after the original featuring characters with the same names played by new actors - virtually the entire cast was replaced - also replaced was ALL the laughs and funny one liners - cringe worthy and painful to watch - do yourself a favor and skip this #$%! and re-watch the original HARDBODIES (1984)
4,World view of three founders.,These 3 minds are fundemental To our national way of doing government. Staloff gives us a great insight into the genius and stupidity of these great founders and gives us insight into their world view. In view of the debate over what government should do today one should read this book.
1,Zzzzz,"Very boring book. Too basic and drones on and on about the same concept. Honestly this book is geared toward perhaps a pre-teen (middle-school age). For adults looking for a good money-laundering book, recommend The Infiltrator by Robert Mazur."
3,is what it is,Nothing groundbreaking. Can be quite reapetetive. The lyrics are dreadful and actually funny at times. I know they are trying to be serious but its very amaturish writing. Definetely less mature then alot of groups out there.
5,Combat Trance,"Really, really, really good EBM album. Very trance-oriented but not to the point of Apoptygma Berzerk and VNV Nation. Funker Vogt still has their harsh military edge, but with much more lush synths and hugely improved bass. If you're the kind of person who likes to tape glow-sticks to their AK-47, throw some reflective paint on your gas mask, wear your fatigue shirt a bit tighter than usual, and dance like you're in Serbia, this album is for you."
2,Disappointed,I bought this mat early to have time to make a cover for it and to get him familiarized with it. When I received it I was disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a cheaply made item. My son torn it while testing it out.
3,What the teacher wanted,"This was the size mat that my son's preschool teacher asked us to get so that it could fold up and fit in his cubby. Honestly, if you don't have the size limitation placed on you I would go for a thicker mat. This mat is barely better than throwing a thick towel on the floor. That being said my son didn't seem to mind at all and liked having his own special mat. A king sized pillow case makes an excellent case for the mat so they do not have to just lye on top of vinyl (also think that it protects it a bit too). The mat smells like that chemically vinyl smell when first opened so you may want to leave it unwrapped and open before handing it over for your child's use. The vinyl is really thin and does not stand up to much wear and tear and I ended up slapping on a piece of duct tape somewhere mid year to get it to make it through the school year!"
2,not sturdy,"The kinder mats did not last. We did receive the mats in a timely manner however soon after we received them, the seams tore quickly. They are only used for 2 hours a day and then folded nicely and put away. Definitely not worth it."
2,Cheap,"I ordered these mats for my childcare center, the only thing I can say is you get what you pay for. They work for now during nap time,however I will be purchasing some more durable padded ones or maybe cots."
3,Fast solution but thin pad,We purchased this for my niece in daycare. The mat was a thinner version than I expected. Basic kindermat is a fair description.
2,"Well, where to start....","It happens always the same with a lot of great metal / rock (or other genres) muisicians: they manage to produce two or three masterpieces (in the case of Ronnie, HOLY DIVER and THE LAST IN LINE) and then, all of a sudden, all the magic is gone. But, like they are really gifted musicians, they manage to release strong and sometimes sucessful albums.This is the case for Dio. He lost his ""magic"" a long time ago, but his perseverance in playing the sytle he loves and his authenticy (no to mention his amazing voice) granted him a loyal following (including me).As for KILLING THE DRAGON, it's same old stuff all over again, but there are sme annoying fillers here that I could not believe.Other trouble is his obsession with dragons, magic, light, stars, etc, etc.. HIs lyrics are becoming just a joke, repetitive, empty. In HOLY DIVER and Sabbath's Heaven adn Hell, for example, he could be a little more ecletic in the lyrics department. Now all he writes about is RPG subject..."
3,Good but not Great.,"Ronnie is still one of my all time favorite singers even though this album I would only rate as average. The quality of the recording is very good and tight but many of the songs I found to be very empty.There are a couple of very good tunes and a few I can live without, such as Rock & Roll. The lyrics on the album are classic DIO with plenty of dragons and magic and Ronnie's voice sounds great. All put together the album is good but not great. If you are a DIO fan spend the few bucks and pick it up and decide for yourself, at least it is better than most of the music out today."
1,Disappointing,"I'm sad to say this, since RJD is one of my all-time favourite singer and artist, but this record is one of his worst efforts ever.While the previous record ""Magica"" had wonderful atmosphere that helped it gets his way, ""Killing The Dragon"" is just showing an artist who's trying his best in copying his best works. Failing.This album could be easily described as ""Holy Diver part 67"". But worse. No new ideas, nothing interesting (the best song, ""Rock'n'Roll"" is a swipe of LEd Zeppelin's Kashmir), a mediocre band (Simon Wright and Doug Aldritch are not half as good as Vinnie Appice and Viv Campbell) and no real reason to buy this!"
4,KEEP IT UP RONNIE,I'm listening to this as type up this review and must say i'm very impressed. Always liked Dio from Rainbow to Sabbath and even to his solo career. This is a solid album with great tunes. Doug Aldrich does fantastic guitar playing. The rest of the band is tight as well. Push=great riff Killing the Dragon=Wicked riff and lyrics Rock&Roll;=Tour da Force Throw Away the Children=My personal fav and the rest is great as well.Dio keep that voice in good condition and continue to make albums.Music today is not and may never be good ever again. BUY IT!!!PEACE OUT
4,"His best since ""Dream Evil""","I've been a fan of Dio since 1984 and I must say that I am very impressed with this cd. Lots of times, an artist will come out with an album & say that it sounds like their old stuff, but this one really does. It really has an energy & a vitality to it that Dio had been missing for some time. Although I like all their albums, some are considerably better than others I'm sure you'll agree. Doug, the new guitarist, seems very comfortable in his role taking over for Craig Goldy & fits in somewhere between he & Vivian Campbell. In other words, if we can't have Vivian back, this is the next best guy. I've finally gotten something I thought might be gone forever: another 80s metal gem! Thank goodness for an artist like Dio who won't sell out! Highly recommended!"
3,"As much as he'd like, we'll never get another Holy Diver","This is a good album, but sounds like he tried to mix 'Wolves' with the previous outing, Magica. Bring back Vinnie, reunite with Ritchie or Tony, but stop it with these albums. He still has the golden voice that made Holy Diver thru Strange Highways so great, but the lyrics reak and his guitarist tries to steal the show. It's almost like trying to put lyrics to Satriani's solos, it just doesn't happen. Chalk up another one in the dump bin along with Angry Machines. By the way, what's the name of the bonus track, as Amazon won't say."
5,DIO...THE GREATEST!!!,"I BUY THIS IN HERE ENHANCED, 2 BONUS AUDIO TRACKS LIVE WITH ""DEEP PURPLE"" 1 VIDEO 'N SCREENSAVERS...DON'T MISSED IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?! BUY IT NOW!!!"
5,A must buy for Dio fans!,"I've read the other reviews and must disagree with a few. While this CD doesn't have the intensity of Holy Diver or Last in Line, it's still one of his best. If you liked Magica you'll like this one. My favorite tracks are Scream, Rock & Roll, Push and the Title track Killing the Dragon.If you're an oldschool headbanger like me and thirsty for 80's and early 90's sounding metal BUY IT NOW! To put my taste in perspective I thought Angry Machines in 1996 was absolutely dreadful and Strange Highways was only so-so.Dio is back doing what he does best! I can't wait until Magica II comes out next year!!"
2,BOOOORING,"Ronnie James Dio is my favourite artist of all time. But this new work is so BORING!!! What happened? I don't know why people compare this with Holy Diver & Last in Line! HELLLLO???? Where can I find a song as strong as ""Rainbow In The Dark"", ""Egypt"", ""Caught In The Middle"", ""Holy Diver""?? what we have here are boring rock n' roll songs. This lineup (exept Jimmy Bain) is old and tired. Simon (drummer) is inimaginative, the new guitar player doesn't know what a METAL riff is, he plays well, but lacks of enthousiasm. I can't find on this CD the energy of the first DIO albums. Well, I hope that Ronnie James Dio takes some time to think, listen and compare his first works with this one... It's heaven & hell...."
3,"Dio......not quite at his best, but close enough","Is KILLING THE DRAGON a good Dio album ? Yeah.Is this his best album ? Nah.Dio's back and he's brought along his old friend Jimmy Bain and some new friends, most notably ex-Bad Moon Rising guitarist Doug Aldrich.While the lead guitar riffs through out the album are pretty tight, but the rhythm guitars are stale and generic ( listen to the title track if you don't believe me ).To be perfectly honest, this is simply a Dio album.KILLING THE DRAGON offers nothing new or progressive, just the average mysticism which we've always enjoyed from the wizard known as Ronnie James Dio.So if you're a die hard DIO fan, pick this one up but don't pay more than $ 15 for it."
4,Dio Returns With A Vengeance,"Is Ronnie James Dio the Dick Clark of Heavy Metal? To listen to Killing The Dragon one would think that this is the album right after 1984's The Last In Line...his voice sounds that good. Hard to believe he's the same age as my mother. The exit of Craig Goldie and the entrance of Doug Aldrich mark a exceptional twist, for Aldrich sounds a little more like Vivian Campbell and a little less like Ritchie Blackmore. The riffs are definitely rocking and the songs are back to the Sword & Sorcery granduer that RJD prefers. All in all a solid effort and probably as close to Holy Diver & The Last In Line that Dio will ever get again. Very metal and very kewel. Yesss....Dio has returned!"
5,"Organized, coherent material that should be standard reading","If anyone has ever tried to make clear the the foundations of employment discrimination law, Donohue cuts them to dust. His brilliant piece is more than just a clever name. Although it is unfortunate that his affable sense of humor takes a back seat, he still manages to grip the reader with his exceptional analyses and pertinant data. I would recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest in the field of employment discrimination law. In fact, it should be standard reading in every law school across the country. No library or bookstore worth its salt is complete without this book."
4,"Great for ""foundations of the faith"" type bible study","I used the first session for the launch of a ""Foundations of the Faith"" bible study. It is good. Relevant scriptures and gentle coaxing to study more. I wish the author used a larger format with room for 'workbook' space to encourage written answers to his very relevant questions. The book was highly recommended as a tool for bible study and I am very impressed."
4,"Good story, more adult themes","A good book to add to the BattleTech/Mechwarrior book collection. Sometimes the book introduces too many characters but has a good amount of action, drama, and politics. Not recommended for young readers (gore/ light sexual themes), but it was nice to see the more ""adult"" themes in the series, that we all know is there, but isn't always written about. Id say the second best book of the new Dark Age novels only behind ""Ghost War""."
2,"Not bad, not good","Some decent story advancement, but overall was far too concerned with side stories, and Ms. Bick seems overly indulgent with blood, gore, and sex, not necessarily in that order. More convoluted than the average Mechwarrior - Dark Age novel, and not in a good way."
1,Robert Jordan?,I thought I was reading a Robert Jordan novel the way the story line jumps around. Too bad it wasn't as well written as Robert's novels.
2,Want some more Kurita?,"If you love Japanese culture in general and House Kurita in particular, this is THE book for you. If you can tell the difference between a cho-sa, a tai-sho, and a tai-shu at a glance, this book will be one you love. As for me, I wanted my kaishakunin so I could sepuku in my tabi. It desperately needed a Japanese to English glossary for the most often used terms.I hated the ending, it seemed very anti-climactic to me. The super fantastic machine introduced which was worth an Assault Mech's weight in platinum, was talked about for 1 page, and referenced in one paragraph, then was never talked about again. If you still want to buy this book, look for my copy on an auction site near you."
3,ok mugs,"I bought 10 of these/5 sets as christmas presents. I'm glad I bought 2 extra, since some of them were cracked at the bottom, but one was completely separated. I superglued it... but it is not really useable."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!!!!!!,"After spending 2 hours trying to get paper with a photo to fit in the cup I gave up! Don't waste your time!!! It really shouldn't get any stars, but Amazon makes you give it at least one."
5,easy read for SEM,"My professor and one graduate student recommended this book as a reference of SEM, and they say that it is an easy-read."
4,A hit!,"The Empires series is all over the place:SUPERB:NapoleonGOOD:Martin LutherIslamThe GreeksALRIGHT:The MediciPeter&Paul;JapanThe Kingdom of DavidSNORE-FEST:EgyptRomeSo I didn't know WHAT to expect from Queen Victoria. But I really enjoyed it. It's one of the best of the Empires series: The Crystal Palace, The Crimean War, Dr. Livingston, India, The Boer war, The Diamond mines etc. Very informative and entertaining.One other thing: why is Donald Sutherland narrating this thing? Of all people, can they not get someone British?"
4,Review,"Except for the ubuquitous reenactments, I enjoyed this purchase immensely. I have, however, earned my living writing for the last 35 years and resent being told the minimum number of words I must use to make myself understood; hence, this is my last review until such time as Amazon has enough faith in me to let ME decide how many (or few)words I may need to express myself-dispositively."
2,More of a Broad Overview than a Lesson,"I bought this tape expecting the ""listen and learn"" method of better speech that was promised. There are only two short exercises given in the 2 tapes, the rest is general information; some of which is unecessary, such as interview tips and how to keep your vocal chords healthy. I wish they would have taken more time to give concrete help."
2,Not worth your money,"Contained very little information for the amount of money they charge for this audio CD. Not worth your money at all. See perfect english audio CD isntead, 4 CDs and a book for under $20."
1,Stay away from this camera,"I saw a lot of reviews about the background audio noise. I thought people may be too picky, and then bought one myself. How stupid I am. Now I have to return it immediately and pay the shipping fee. I don't want to punish my ears when watching the playback."
2,"""Remove Cassette"" too frequent","Nice picture quality, nice zoom. It would also be nice if this camcorder functioned half of the time. Does ""remove cassette"" mean anything to you?My advice: Never buy Canon. I've used GL1's and GL2's that have also had this problem."
3,International travellers please consider this.,"I had this for a good 11 months despite the fact that it had audio noise while playback, that was a good entry level camcorder. I had to return this because it started giving me mild electric shock, while charging the unit in the countries that have 220v spec. I used adapters and convertors that take me from US system to international systems. I took this camcorder with me and travelled outside of the United States. And interestingly it was not giving any electric shock while charging in US after my return. So if you are a world traveller then please consider this."
2,tape error,"Had the ZR300 for less than 3weeks when I receivedthe following error message ""Remove the cassette"".The cassette will not eject, however, so the unit is nowat the canon repair center. Failed just before july 4when I really wanted to use it. I will now see if Ican get an extended warranty for this puppy."
4,High optical zoom,"A key feature of this camera is its high optical zoom, which is necessary for filming events where you are trying to keyin on a particular person or thing but are relegated to filming at a distance - e.g., graduation ceremonies, sports events, stage recitals. The Canon MiniDV camcorder starter kit with a case and extra battery is a good additional purchase. As other reviewers have noted, it is necessary to buy a firewire cable for transferring video from the camera to the computer. I have not noticed the excess noise that some other reviewers have mentioned. I have found this to be a fine product for its price."
2,"Camera needs rethinking, not a good product.","I bought this camera to take footage and pictures of my new little girl. I heard Canon was supposed to have the best picture quality. When I got the camera the image was terrible and choppy while the camera was panning across the room. Very grainy and unsmooth. It's supposed to have night vision, but it's still too dark. The sound quality was horrible, it records the sounds of the motor inside running, that's all you hear in a quiet room."
3,How easy can it transfer the data to harddrive?,Will that take a long time? Is there any option to record the video directly to a small hard drive thing in the digital camrecorder
5,The Country with an Unpredictable Past,"After years of meticulous research and field work, one of Russia's most prolific genre writers challenges the traditional version of the Russian history. A Russia That Was Not is a true eye-opener, as Bushkov's no-nonsense, logical approach to many events and mysteries of the past leads him and the reader to conclusions that disagree with the official side of story! Was Russia initially indeed a Catholic country? Would the decembrists' ""liberating"" conspiracy propel the country into the nightmare of a ruthless dictatorship? And did Peter the Great really have to introduce the supposedly three-centuries-behind-their-time Russians to the western lifestyle?Yet another version of the Russian history, but written with so much wit and insight it just might happen to be accurate!"
3,Pretty good score,"Graeme Revell's score for ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" is like the film it accompanies: By-the-book, but well done. There's nothing we haven't heard before here; your typical suspense score with emphazis on strings and woodwinds. In some parts it reminds me of Shore's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but nowhere near as good. Still, this is a very atmospheric score with some good, exciting cues, and some very uplifting and emotional moments. Revell makes good use of the theme from the aria ""Poor Wand'ring One"" (which is on the album) from Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Pirates of Penzance"". This more or less forms the main theme of the album, and is used imaginatively to create both suspense and serenity.Overall, a good score - but in the long run perhaps not something you should spend your money on unless you are a die-hard Revell fan, or, like me, liked the film enough to want a piece of it on CD."
4,Peter David comes through again,"Just like the rest of his books, Peter David comes through again.Good book, good naration, good fun."
5,Imzadi ROCKS!!!,"Everything you could possibly dream of is in this book: action, humour, friendship, and of course, sex. What I loved about this book is the funny dialogue. It was also interesting to uncover the relationship between Riker and Troi before they came to the Enterprise. Imzadi explores love, and would touch any reader's heart"
3,Interesting exploration of the Riker/Troi relationship,Interesting exploration of the Riker/Troi relationship but deeply flawed. The characterisations don't quite ring true and in it William Riker's middle name is Thelonius not Thomas as it should be. I hear there's going to be a sequel to this Imazadi II. I hope's better don't bother with this one. Apart from being well written it doesn't have much else to merit it.
1,"One of, if not the most pathetic Star Trek book in history!","This book is the sappiest book I've ever read! It is horrible! The plot is so over-used, it's not even interesting with a Star Trek premise! It's like a Daniel Steele novel! I recommend this book to only my worst enemies!"
1,Disgusting,"Just about every Peter David book I have ever read--Vendetta, Imzadi, Q-Squared, Strike Zone, A Rock and a Hard Place, and Knight Life (not a ST novel)--contains some amount of disgusting, annoying, and unnecessary sexual innuendo, and it goes too far in this book. After reading it, I firmly decided I would never read it again."
5,One of the best books I ever read!!!,I couldn't put this book down. It had great adventure and a wonderful love story. How could anyone not like this book???
1,Kindle Edition,"I love this book. A lot. And I love my Kindle. A lot. But I am not buying this Kindle book, because there are no paragraph indentations in the sample. That's just too confusing. I'm not paying nine bucks for something I can barely make sense of. Amazon, please fix this book!"
4,IMZADI!,This is definitely one of the better Star Trek: TNG books out there. Riker literally goes to the end of the universe and back to save Deanna. Please add this to your collection.
3,This book has nothing in it but sex.,"This book doesn't have much of a plot, and if it does, it moves at a snail's pace. For an 11 year old like me, this in itself is insulting, even without all the sex. There is nothing more to this book. Read Q Squared; it's a great book with a wonderfully complicated plot."
5,Kids love it!,I watch 3 children daily ranging in age from 9 months to 7 years old and EVERYONE enjoys this cd! The baby stopped crying every time I put it on and the two year old and 7 year old knew all the words after listening to it for a whole week before Christmas. The family was impressed that the kids knew so many songs at such young ages! The songs are all sung by children so the kids could relate and wanted to keep listening and I didn't find it nearly as annoying as many other childrens albums. I actually enjoyed listening to most of the songs too!
3,"Lively, energetic tunes","To the person writing the review ""repugnant trash for mentally retarded 3 year olds,"" shame on you! That's a terrible thing to say. Retardation is nothing to joke about or to use as an insult.To anyone interested in buying this cd: My kids--all under the age of 5, really enjoy it...mostly because it has lively tunes...as opposed to Children Sing for Children which is full of slow and boring traditionals. The music on this cd is very jazzy and certainly not for everyone, but surely a mature grown-up can tolerate the tunes for 30 minutes at a time."
1,Yuck!,"It makes me cringe just to imagine the Kiz Bop Kids singing ""Jingle Bells""! You may as well just ask your friend to sing to you, because it's a lot cheaper, and your friend will probably sound better. As if the pop CDs weren't bad enough, Kidz Bop is now threatening Christmas?! What has the music world come to?!"
1,no new songs,"My son enjoys the Kidz Bop Christmas albums. We have 4 previously released Kidz Bop Christmas CD's. These are: Kidz Bop Christmas (2002),The Coolest KB Christmas Ever, A very Merry KB, and KB Christmas Party. Every song on this ""new"" CD is a duplicate of one on the CDs we already own. If you don't have any of these yet and have a young child this CD may still be a good choice."
2,OK..NOT WORTH BUYING,"Monstrosity - In Dark Purity is a breath of fresh air compared to the weak-sounding Enslaving the masses(live tracks,poor sounding demos) and the forgettable Millenium and Imperial Doom . Tracks 2 and 4 are decent but typical US sounding DM and the rest grows boring fast."
1,Boring & weak,"This sounds pretty lame and stupid not the good deathmetal i like to hear...(...).All their albums suck and yes i've heard all of them.Skip this and buy anything from immolation,napalmdeath,vomitory,mortician,fleshcraw etc.. Don't bother!"
5,A Must Buy,"For fans of technical death, this is a great cd. The riffs are technical and the drums are extremely fast and on time, and the vocals kill. HOWEVER, The song structures are fairly simple, and arent nearly as dynamic as Suffocations. Still highly recommended and much better than C. Corpse"
4,Pretty funny and unexpected,"How many books do you find about a girl that turns her brother into a pig? This is the first and only one I've ever seen. This book is funny, because it discusses how humans can be worse than pigs sometimes, and how wishes are hard to ""get right."" Even though this was a very original and entertaining book for me, I still had some problems with it, like how Tom and Tod, the twin brothers both trying to hook up with Louise's mom, were very outright about how they were both after Clara. The dialogue seemed a little fake. don't get me wrong, it was an exceptional book."
3,Be Careful What You Wish For!,"This is a very creative book for children. The story is about a girl named Louise who lives on a farm with her mother and her brother, Willie. Like all siblings, Louise and Willie have their disagreements. After wishing on a star that Willie would turn into a pig, Louise finds that people need to be careful what they wish for. Willie disappears, leaving Louise thinking that her brother might have not been so bad, afterall. With Louise's father being gone, it is up to her and her mother to figure out a way to make their wishes work for them in making all well again on the farm. Others in the town become involved in this mess, as strange things continue to take place throughout the book. This story is filled with humor, magic, and of course, wishes, kisses, and pigs! I recommend this book for any reader looking for a light-hearted fairytale to make you smile."
2,"A medium tale at best, certainly not a tall one","""Wishes, Kisses, and Pigs"" proved a trying, sometimes tiresome book to read. The affected language (why are country folk still fair game for this sort of mildly insulting diction?) distracts from the narrative, and the plodding, somewhat convoluted plot leaves too much unanswered (what does ever happen the father?) and out of reach for a satisfying ending. The premise is typical fairy tale stuff and there are some funny scenes, but even so, I kept wishing for a faster ending to this medium tale (it doesn't qualify as a tall tale."
5,I love this album!,"I just love this album. I have to say I love this as much as my ""Elvis Is Back"" CD which is the ultimate! My parents got me the album at an Estate sale. This has a great selection of songs. After listening and owning so many albums of his over the years and played them into the ground I am getting picky in my old age and I am very selective. I say get this one and the Elvis Is Back! The first songs are slow and very relaxing that shows how beautiful Elvis' voice was. Then the second half is upbeat and very cool with a few songs that deserve more attention than they have gotten in the past. You have to have this!"
4,Something For Everybody,"This is his third non-soundtrack, post-Army album. On A side were originaly ballads and on B side rockers. The ballads nicely arranged and the rockers rock! ""I Want You With Me"" is certainly the wildest!"
3,Hard to find!,"Rare Industrial/EBM album. out of print. A remix album of the song ""soilbleed""...good remix work done here. I don't suggest this album to anybody who isn't allreday a fan of Grendel. If your new to Grendel, probably better to start with the 2007 relese 'Harsh Generation'."
4,Very well pleased!,"I just got done watching this DVD and can't understand why someone would give it such a low and negative rating. I don't see any problem with the quality, it's not digital, but so what.I found it to be well orchestrated and highly informative about the Uechi Ryu style and the history of it's techniqes. It teaches alot about the style and as I said before the quality is fine and completely acceptable."
1,It would be funny if it wasn't so sad!,"Apparently, Yamato Productions have become so notorious for the appalling quality of their videos they have changed their name (again) to Rising Sun Productions, or is it the other way round!.Nothing else has changed however. If a student submitted this video as a high school project the best he or she could expect is an ""F"". There is nothing good you can say about it. Appalling production values, horrible inaccuracies, and excruciatingly bad presentation all combine to form the archetypal Rising Sun/Yamato/George Alexander video production. Frankly I am surprised that a company as reputable as Amazon.com includes junk like this in their collection.As far as it being ""Another winner for Yamato Productions"". If this is a winner then so is Sadam Hussein"
1,Don't Buy This!,"I ordered this DVD because my daughter takes this type of karate and I wanted a guide to help her learn the routines, which can get complicated. However, the quality of this DVD is COMPLETELY unacceptable -- it's so dark and pixilated in most places that one cannot even see what is happening. It is truly awful, and totally unwatchable. If there was a negative stars rating I would have used that -- I hate to give this even one star. I have written to Amazon and suggested they remove this piece of, well, you know, from their site to avoid disappointing more customers."
3,Calidad del producto...,La calidad del contenido de este DVD podría haber sido un poco mejor; algunos fragmentos parecen haber sido tomados de un VHS antiguo.
1,Get a real guitar,"This guitar does not hold tune, no matter what you do. I changed the strings, I even tried my friends strings that had been well broken in, the guitar just does not hold tune. For the money, you're better off saving a little and getting a Squier or something."
1,Twice Defective,"I purchased the Behringer electric guitar package for my 11 year old son's birthday. The first guitar arrived defective. The fret bars extend (just slightly) from the edges of the fret board causing my son's had to be cut when playing. I had a musician look at the guitar to verify that the guitar was in fact defective. I returned the guitar and all of it's accessories to the Target store. I oredered another guitar package thinking, ""What are the chances two guitars would be defective?"" The second guitar arrived....SAME PROBLEM! My son and I were very dissappointed. I have purchased many things from Amazon.com and have always been please. Sadly enough, that was not the case with this guitar. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Additionally, it is a safety hazzard for children and Behringer should take it off the marked until the problem is resolved."
3,Excellent Remarks,"I expected much here but I got a little from a prolific writter like Andrew. His serialization topics is great I expected him to cover much on security, Themes, SKIN and web form controls and best practices and little bit on design pattern."
2,Not too good,"Ever read a good Petzold book?This isnt like that at all.All I can add is ditto to what someone else has said.----------------------I am very disappointed. While techically accurate and covering a large amount of topics, this book has been a pain to read even for a very interested and curious programmer like me. The writing style is annoying at best.--------------The book is very difficult to follow it just does not flow and concentrates too much on things that mean little or nothing."
5,This science teacher's new best friend,"Teaching astronomy is not easy when you know nothing. This book asks all the questions I have and my students have. It has fairly technical language for my 7th graders, but I can get the main ideas and relay them.How old is the solar system? (I forget) Will the sun go super nova? (no)There is an awesome time line which goes way back, and then tracks events predicted by science fiction authors. (fun!)There is an excellent website too, but I had to buy the book because the web site wouldn't give all the answers - it said to buy the book!I did and I am not sorry."
5,"Finally, something worked for me.","I'm so happy to have found this herbal supplement to increase milk production. While working full time and trying to feed a 5 month old, I noticed that I could pump about 65% of what my child needed. I tried so many things for months to increase my supply. That includes oatmeal, fenugreek pills, mother's milk tea, and lactation cookies -- none of these worked as quickly or effectively as Motherlove's More Milk Plus. After 2 days (and finally taking the dosages as instructed) I was able to get 30% increase over my 3 pumping sessions. I'll continue to take these pills for another few months. They are worth the price! This product will help me breastfeed and pump longer. Thank you Motherlove!"
1,won't repurchase,"I had high hopes for More Milk Plus since it contained a blend of herbs. I thought it would work better than fenugreek alone or a nursing tea. This was not the case. I think More Milk Plus is overpriced. I got better results from either fenugreek alone (2-3 caps 3 times a day) or Yogi Nursing Mother's tea (3 cups a day). And they are cheaper. I will not repurchase More Milk Plus. After talking to other nursing mom's in a local breastfeeding group we have come to the conclusion that More Milk Plus works better for skinny moms that weigh less than 150lbs. For those of us who weigh more, and thus take the higher does, we did not see the results."
5,a must have for low milk productiion,"This is a must have. I had my baby aug of 2010 and I struggled with low production for 2 and a half months to no avail I was forced to formula which I hate personally. I talked to a lactation consultat and she recommeded more milk plus (this after trying feenugreek, milk mothers tea and a few others) more milk plus worked immediatley. Before I may have gotten 2 to 3 oz. Now I'm up to 5 to 10 oz. Amazing. Love this product. It worked for me hope it works for u too."
1,Didn't notice any difference,"I work full time & pump @ work. I was trying to up my milk production to keep up with my growing 6 month old. Took a whole bottle & didn't notice any difference in my milk production. Was really hoping it would help after reading the good reviews, but maybe it was just me. It didn't do anything???"
3,didn't help my low supply,I have suffered from low milk supply since month one and these herbal pills didn't to do anything for me. I have bought the same thing at a natural grocer for much cheaper. IMO you are paying for the name brand.
5,It really works!,"I bought it for my wife. She had not enough amount of milk for our baby, but with this capsules she began to produce definitely more milk!"
1,Did not work,"Took recommended dose. Not only did my milk supply not go up, it actually decreased. I wish that I had not tried it."
3,It's only ok,"I wasn't terribly impressed with this formula. I took plain fenugreek for a while, then switched to this blend, and it definitely doesn't work as well as plain fenugreek. Maybe I would have a better opinion if this was the first thing I tried and then moved on to fenugreek later. My suggestion is, save your money and just use plain fenugreek to improve your milk supply."
2,"Works great, but.....","This stuff really does work! However, it did quite a number on my digestive system so I had to give it up. If you can stomach it, you will be able to increase your supply."
2,Not living up to expectations,"Before taking this product, I was pumping 3 -5oz total. After this product, I was pumping maybe 6-7oz. I thought by taking this I would be able to pump 5oz per breast. I pump more than I nurse because I only got six weeks off of work. This is my third child."
1,horrible,"these pills were overpriced and did absolutely nothing! I'm very disappointed in this product.More Milk Special Blend ""Motherlove"" , 120 Vegetarian Capsules"
1,Warning: May cause blood sugar to drop too low,"Talk to your doctor prior to taking this supplement or any supplement with Fenugreek. Also, know your sugar level. Mine was border line low before I started taking this pill and my sugar level became dangerously low. I was not aware of the side effects.Plus, I did not find an increase in my milk supply"
4,Good milk supplement.,"I used this product throughout nursing and it really increased my milk supply. However, I took it by the handful to get enough because I weighed about 195 after the kids were born. I had twins, so I needed all the help I could get. It's a bit expensive and gives you a good bit of acid reflux, but for you babies, it is worth it. I didn't see any difference between the pills and the liquid."
4,Worked once i figured out my dosing,"I started taking these after my LC recommended them. At first I didn't notice any difference, but once I started taking two pills at a time I started to feel fuller. I'm still having to supplement but not as much"
4,"Expensive, but it works","Though these pills are expensive, they work. I exclusively pump to feed my baby. Before I was taking Fenugreek alone and producing 40oz per day (she eats 25oz). With this stuff I produce about 45-48oz per day. My baby is just over 2 months old and I have over 1000 oz in the freezer so far. Plan to feed her my frozen stash when she turns 7 or 8 months so I don't have to pump for a full 12 months.One thing I didn't realize about this product until a week after starting it is that you can't drink more than an ounce or two of liquid 15 minutes before or after taking it, which is kind of a pain in the butt."
1,Worse than I expected,"Not only my milk supply didn't increase but it decreased. I understand results may vary but I certainly didn't expect to stop producing any milk. Purchase at your own risk. I don't think it's the company, fenugreek just doesn't work on me."
2,Not working for me.,"I take 4 of these a day because I ran out of my other brandNursing Blend Breastfeeding Supplementand thought I'd try something else.Didn't work. I actually saw a net loss in milk production. I've been using this through September, to give it a good shot, and pump like crazy at work. The weird thing was that pumping without this supplement, my milk went up half an ounce. Not a fluke, it was 3 days in a row not taking it.So, this is a no go for me. Maybe my body hates the blend, or the liquefied encapsulated dose is not potent enough, or maybe I take it wrong/at the wrong time.Regardless, the other supplement works better at all hours for me. Tonight I am buying the tried and true to ensure my milk supply stays up."
1,No help for me,"I bought this product hoping that it would help increase my milk supply. I was pumping all the time and getting very little. My little girl was eating so much that I had to start giving her formula along with breast milk. Well I took this for one week at the recommended dose and nothing, nothing at all. So I decided the following week that I would increase the dose since I am heavier and still nothing. So after 2.5 weeks of downing this stuff I have nothing to show for it but going to straight formula. I just couldn't get enough breast milk pumped for one feeding after pumping all day."
2,Doesn't work,More milk plus doesn't work. I have followed the directions and have seen no increase in my milk supply. Don't waste your money!!
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Based on all the positive reviews I purchased these to increase my milk supply. Well, I was surprised to see that I have not seen an improvement AT ALL. NO IMPROVEMENT!!! I have been taking these as indicated on the bottle but my milk supply has not budged at all, not even a quarter of an oz. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT DOES NOT WORK."
2,Didn't really work for me,I bought these because all the reviews were so great. I think I just don't respond to fenugreek or whatever is in these. I didn't really see my milk supply go up. After a week of taking them I still hadn't noticed a difference. I kept it up but still no difference. I'm sure it works for some people but just not me.
1,Does not work for me,"took 4 pills a day as instructed, continuous for 2-3 weeks now, does not work at all for me, that's all I can say...i wish it comes with manufacturer satisfaction guarantee for a refund."
3,Seeing moderate results,I tried this product at the suggestion of a lactation consultant because I'm not producing enough milk to feed my 8 week old. He was in the NICU for a week after he was born and we never quite got the hang of breast feeding so I've been pumping and supplementing with formula. The pumping isn't quite the same thing as actually breast feeding so my supply has pretty much stayed the same. So far I'd say my milk has definitely increased although not in huge amounts. I'd estimate it's up about half an ounce per pump. I've only been using it a week so I'm hoping that'll increase a bit more with time. I'd definitely suggest buying it here rather than a local Whole Foods like I did since it's $25 for just 60 pills there versus 120 here.
5,Helped me with my supply,"My little one and I started off with an emergency C-section and my baby girl in the NICU, because of this we didn't get started breastfeeding until day two of life and though I pumped and pumped my milk didn't come in until day five. My lactation consultant recommended I take these supplements and they have really made a difference for us."
5,it certainly helps to increase the milk supply,I tried fenugreek but it didn't do much to me. These pills certainly did the job :) They are also very reasonable in price compare to Whole Foods prices (as twice as cheaper here).I would recommend for increasing the milk supply.
2,Didn't work for me. Had to switch to Lactiful,I tried the whole bottle without much noticeable difference. Switched to Lactiful and had a plentiful increase in milk. Not being able to drink 15 minutes before and after was an annoyance as well.
5,Jamie NC,"This product is awesome. I work full time and have to pump on a regular basis. Every time my milk production lessens, More Milk Plus increases my milk immediately. You have to take it a few more times than the product recommends, but it works great. I have tried Fenugreek, but this product works wonders. Highly recommend to anyone breastfeeding."
4,More Milk Plus,"I am greatly appreciative for this product. I am so glad that a friend of mine told me about this, as it has greatly helped me out this time with having to nurse my daughter.I have had a lot of stress put on me do to my work enviroment and this supplement sure did do the trick. It did not take long before I noticed an improvement in my milk supply.I highly recommend this to anyone who may need a little help with milk production.Thanks again."
4,worked for me!,"definitely helped with milk production. however, since i had to take between 6 and 8 capsules a day it would sometimes create a momentary after-taste. i would highly recommend it though if you have production issues like i did."
1,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately it didn't work for me. Started by taking 1 capsule 4 times a day, then took 2 capsules 3 times a day. Tried it for about 3 weeks and didn't see any improvement in my milk supply :("
2,Try other things first...,"I hear wonderful reviews about this product, but it simply did not work for me. If you are having supply issues due to a medical problem this will likely not work for you. I've tried it all, short of prescription drugs to get my supply up, which is my next step. I would suggest trying fenugreek (which is cheap- $7@Walmart), drinking lots of water, eating oatmeal, pumping after every feeding-and more, I also hear a (dark) beer a day can help, to try to get your supply up (also contacting a lactation consultant) before spending a lot of money on products like this or Gaia lactate support (similar product I've also tried-same results). I hope this was helpful.*in no way, shape, or form am I a medical professional/ licensed lactation consultant, this is simply my opinion and suggestions I have received from others during my attempt to get my milk supply up. You should always consult a lactation consultant or your doctor before starting any vitamins, etc."
3,not what I expected,"I ordered this after my lactation consultant recommended it. I was hoping it would work better than fenugreek. But the fenigreek worked better. However, I was sick at the time. I still have half a bottle so I will be trying it again since Im not sick anymore. Wish you didnt have to avoid drinking 15 min before and after..."
5,Great Product,"I have been using this product since my baby was 1 month old. I can tell a difference in my milk supply when I forget to take a dose. This does not work for everyone, but it is working for me!!"
3,Hasn't helped me this time,"I used More Milk Plus with my first child and experienced a significant increase in milk supply within hours of taking the first dose. That is why I ordered it again when my milk supply decreased drastically with my second child. Unfortunately, it's been absolutely NO help this time.However, I do know that it works (worked for me before!) and it is recommended by lactation consultants, so by all means give it a try if your milk supply decreases."
1,Did not work for me!,after producing milk for 10 months I slowed down alto so I tryed this and it didnt work for me It got worst taking this and after a month my breat completly stoped making milk. fenugreek works best.
2,Not sure it's working,"I started this a couple of weeks before I started Reglan. I'm not sure either is working as I haven't noticed a discernible difference in my milk supply, and I've taken this religiously and according to the dosage instructions (4X a day with limited fluids before and after). Once I run out of this, I'm going to try straight-up fenugreek."
3,Good,I like these capsules. There is no aftertaste and I feel like they have helped me increase my milk supply so that my child is able to breast feed. Thanks so much!
5,"First-ever book on ELVIS' ""live"" films","Elvis Presley made 33 motion pictures,but his last two,THAT'S THE WAY IT IS and ELVIS ON TOUR,are outstanding fan-favorites as they are the only official backstage ""real life"" glimpses of Presley released during his lifetime.Joe Tunzi is no stranger to Elvis fans as he has published over two dozen volumes of ""rare"" Presley photos.THE DOCUMENTARIES is a bit different in that, beyond being a collection of unseen photos from the two films,it weaves documents,film footage information press material and memorabilia into a historical overview.The result is a scrapbook of images,both familiar and rare,all relating to the production and release of Presley's two musical ""docufilms"".If you are a fan of THAT'S THE WAY IT IS and ON TOUR (and what Elvis fan isn't?)...ELVIS THE DOCUMENTARIES is a worthy purchase."
1,Over priced plastic,"I used a coupon to purchase this and only paid $3.00; I still feel like I got ripped off. These are just cheap pieces of plastic that really diminish the visibility of the Palm and definitely aren't worth $20.00. Find something better, or do without."
2,"Good for what it does, but with big time limitations","These are great for one purpose only: protecting your screen for scratches. Yes, this is what they are intended for. However, the limitations on the visibility of the screen are extremely serious. The screen looks like a completely different device with and without these writerights. I didn't like the idea of cutting them to fit the graffitti area since I have gotten scratches from dragging things in the viewing area.The biggest drawback of this product is the price. The recommend changing the screen protector once a month but they charge in excess of $30 for a package of 12. What a rip off! For a basically a clear and textured sticker, you're paying a couple of dollars a piece. Seems way overpriced! Especially if you change them at the recommended times. Unfortunately, there are no competitors that I've seen. I'd probably give this 4 stars if the price was better."
4,great for your investment,"I really liked this product. It takes alot of damage that your screen wont. Putting it on my visor's screen straight and without air bubbles took a few tries, but it prevents my screen from getting biffed up when accidents happen. Some people complain about the clarity of their screens diminishing, which is true to a certain degree, but I didn't buy the visor deluxe for its heart stopping graphics, I bought it for the calendar and contact database."
3,It's the only game in town.....,"I think someone like ""Scotch Tape"" or whatever should look at this product and create a much better screen protector than this one from ""Fellowes!... The tape is very hard to put on, especially when first learning how with the crazy instructions provided, no matter what, you'll get air bubbles (They go away after a whiile, and in spite of having no problems in writing or anything to that nature, they seem to knock out visibility, especially at night. Still, I'd get them and use them before you ever place the stylus on the screen... It's nice know you have absoltely no scratches on the flimsy screen Handspring builds! Hey, what can I say? In all sincerity, however, the plastic film does seem to last a long time...Very expensive at $19.95 plus tax.... and I had to buy an additional pak because I wasted 4 of them to learn how to do it right...."
3,Great for Palm IIIx bad for Palm IIIc,"I was distressed to see this product listed under the Palm IIIc accessories. I have used this product for a year with my Palm IIIx and it's great. So, I tried it with my new Palm IIIc. It really distorts the display. In fact, if you go to Concept Kitchen's web-site, they say to not use this with the Palm IIIc. They are working on one for the Palm IIIc. Hopefully it will be out soon."
3,Grafiti area only please,"I agree with most of the other reviews here. The writeright reducesvisibility of the screen and is tricky to put on correctly, but adds protection and a better writing feel.I too have cut the covers into small strips to cover the Grafiti writing area only. Just too much screen degradation for me to keep the screen covered on my Palm IIIxe. But very useful for the Grafiti area - where most writing takes place.All in all, I wish they made ones specifically for only the grafiti writing area. Also, these are overpriced - but you won't find them cheaper anywhere."
1,If I could see the screen,"I figured I'de buy these to protect the screen after a friend recommended them. I recieved them yesterday and applied them as instructed. The display is so hard to read now, it ruins any anti-glare/protection value. If you don't mind holding your visor to your nose to read it, then by all means, buy these, but if the idea of a translucent matte finished pad obscuring your handsprings screen sounds unappealing, save your money"
3,You need this,"I suggest applying the film to the graffiti area only. On my previous PDA's this was the only area of the screen which was scratched eventually. I put one on my new visor three months ago, and it is still fine. By my calculation, at this rate my current supply will last until 2017. A bargain."
1,Writeright wrong for me,"I bought a Handspring Prism earlier in the week and decided that I would skip the extra 25.00 for 12 sheets of plastic. Then I reconsidered and went back today and bought them against my initial judgement. My honest reaction-YUCK! Why can't they make them clear so that they don't interfere with the display. I am not worried about glare. I had a basic Visor before the Prism and it was hard enough to see the screen as it is. Why can't the background on these be standard PDA's be WHITE not GREEN. I will not buy these covers again. In fact, I am looking for someone to take them off my hands. Why do the simplest things cost so much and rarely TRANSFORM the users experience.I'll not make the same mistake twice."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst screen protector I've ever bought. I used it on my first PDA because I didn't know any better. The protector distorts the image on the screen and makes images appear less bright and clear. I'm reminded I have a screen protector on my screen every time I have to look at my PDA; as opposed my other screen protector made by Palm, which I don't notice unless I'm looking for it.Also, this screen protector comes in one small precut size, which suits some people just fine. I like the larger one size fits all of thePalm 3177WW Screen Protectors Multipack, which I can cut to fit many different devices."
1,I'll keep looking . . .,"I purchased these last week for my new Palm IIIxe. I wanted to keep the screen pristine and all. I just returned them today. Here's why: 1. They reduced visibility greatly. When I took the first one off I was shocked by how much better the screen looked without it on. 2. No matter how I tried, I could not apply them without trapping bubbles, etc. 3. They produce a moire pattern on the screen. 4. They were a little too small. 5. Expensive. $2 a shot for a tiny little sheet of plastic. Enough said!"
1,Not worth it,"I have used these in the past when a friend gave me a couple. Though I used them for a couple of months, I finally realized that the degradation in readability just wasn't worth it (IMHO). However, the graffiti writing area does eventually start to scratch without it - so I was reluctantly ordering some more for my trusty current PP, intending to cut a strip for the writing area only.I just tried the suggestion of a previous reviewer to use a piece of ""scotch tape"" over the graffiti area. It works great! Recognition is even better than it was with the Writerights, IMO.These are useful only if protecting your PP is higher on your list than using it effectively."
3,dmiihag,"this only has one unreleased track and it's all instrumental, but get it if you must have everything by the milkmen."
3,Barbie Pretend MP3 Musc Player,"My 5-years old daughter likes the music. In the instructions it showed a dancing image on the screen but it doesn't show up on the MP3 player. So, I don't know if there is supposedto be an image of a little girl dancing or not. For $8 it's okay but not for a regular price of $20."
5,Great Metal From The East,"Signal is among Bow Wow's two or three best albums. They opened for Kiss on their first Japanese tour. If you are a fan of 70's/80's hard rock/metal and want to hear a band with serious instrumental chops, Signal Fire is for you. I always felt sorry for them, people always confused their name with a silly Brit-Pop novelty act and (uggghhh!)a rapper."
3,What Virgin Mary?,"I don't usually review products I haven't laid eyes on, and I have not viewed this DVD. Like Mr Fuenzalida, however, I did see the telecast on public TV, I didn't like the production, and I am not recommending the purchase of this DVD. Unlike Mr. Fuenzalida, I found no ""insult to the Virgin Mary"" in the telecast. I wonder if he is confusing the Virgin Mary with Mary Magdalene, whose portrait Tosca threatens to damage when she suspects (incorrectly) that her lover, the painter Cavaradossi, is having an affair with the model, a woman he saw in church and whose face she recognizes in the painting."
2,Not worthy of DVD release,"This controversial production of Tosca at the Met appears to serve one purpose: to break the traditional mold and reinterpret this classic work for a 21st century audience. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. I'm not just out to bash the creativity that can be found in an edgy production. It's just that many of the designer's and director's choices simply make no sense. A few highlighted missteps:- A cathedral that looks like a dark alley- Scarpia dressed in leather- Tosca collapses on the couch instead of fleeing the scene of Scarpia's murder- Tosca manages to push a large group of strong soldiers down a staircasePuccini's opera has stood the test of time. I can't imagine that this DVD will."
3,More or less average performance,I enjoyed the singing and acting of Cavaradossi and Scarpia. I found Tosca to bemuch less convincing. I admire her in other operas but I didn't find her actingto my taste. She had some difficulty vocally also.The sets were satisfactory. The costumes were good. Conductor and orchestra werevery good.There was some brief partial nudity in Act Two that was not inapropriate. This wasin the HD broadcast so I don't know if it will be on the dvd.If you can find this cheap somewhere it might be worth getting for Scarpia andCavaradossi. There is a better Tosca available with Alvarez on Amazon.
5,Howard Shore - need more be said?,3 discs of an epic soundtrack. You could listen to it all day. There really isn't more to be said.
4,I'm sure it's great...but...,"I'd love to say this CD set is the favorite in my collection.I'd love to comment on the depth and breadth of the artisticmusical composition and performance.But I can't...I've been waiting for my order since the 13th ofMarch and it's still not here. Amazon continues sending methese pleasant little e-mails every couple weeks, letting meknow that in just 2 more weeks I should expect my CDs to arrive.I'm still waiting, and it's been over 3 months. If you havethese CDs, please enjoy them for me. Oh, and you'll probablynote that this page still indicates that the product ships in1-2 days. No change there since the day I placed my order."
2,Skipping tracks,"I'm actually sort of disappointed in the CD's. All three of them were there, and the original packaging was there. However, all three jewel cases were crushed. Disk 1 and disk 3 both have nicks in them, and they skip. The second cd was perfect though."
5,Woot LOTR Is the BOMB!,"Personally,my favorite CD is the first one (maybe because I'm more used to it?)but acually they are all veeerrrYyyyy great and I suggest buying this.And u get 18 free pictures too.If any of you read spinner903's comment...he said this was overpriced.Wrong.He said that he could buy the CD's for less.Yes...he spoke true...but notice that THIS set is ENHANCED.If you bought the 3 CD's seperately and they were enhanced then it would cost 23$ each!And also this is limited edition...(if that means anything to you)...oh yea, and did I mention?Free pictures!Woohoo!"
5,Fantastic movie soundtrack,"Horner is a new person in soundtrack composing, but I think he described with sounds exactly what Tolkien means about all scenes in his book ""the lord of the rings"", as also did Jackson with the direction of the movies. Tolkien was not so easy to understand sometimes for me, now I know more than I could believe, I understand all the people and their stories in this wonderfull saga. Thank You to the good e-seller for the good price I bought the package, this was a great idea too: a special price for a special movie trilogy. Thank You again Veronica"
3,Greatest Soundtracks ever....in a not so great box set,"Not only are the Lord of the Rings movies the greatest of all time, the music within them is top notch as well. The music's themes are excellent and inspiring, even toppling heavy-weights, such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Everything about the actual music is great, but the box set is overpriced. You can buy all three CD's serparatly for much less money or you can buy the first two and then the special edition third CD with extra DVD for around the same price. The included inserts are only for novelty sake; they can be used as actual CD covers, but my feeling is that replacing the inserts is somewhat useless. However, the inserts are of some quality and make excellent tiny posters. If you like the Lord of the Rings, get the soundtracks, but don't be shy to buy the REAL box set with maybe 12 discs with the entire score when it comes out sometime in the near future."
1,Decepio,Caramba comprei esse PACK logo q saiu e por falta de informao do produto pois ñ tinha nada na pagina..a unica informao era q tinha faixa para DVD com materias ineditas sobre ROK..qual a minha decepio quando recebo e vejo q vinha os 2 primeiros cd's da trilogia (q eu ja tenho) e o novo CD de ROK..mas sem nada de DVD...putz o q salvou alem do CD de ROK ser muito bom foram as figuras q realmente so perfeitas..mas preferia ter comprado a verso normal ou a q vem realmente com faixas para DVD.
3,"OK, but thin metal","I had hoped for something a bit heavier, but bolted to the wall it is kid safe, and that is what I needed."
4,Good,"This is not a safe - just the gun storage basically with a lock. Nothing more. Inside parts are terrible, but overall if you just need to lock them up away from the kids for the price - should work. It is light, so will be necessary to bolt to the wall or floor - it did get bent and banged up during the shipping as well, so count on that happening too :)"
2,Dimensions Incorrect,"Delivered in good condition by FedEx ground with two keys (taped to plastic wrap around safe). Nice looking safe. However, the dimensions shown in Amazon's Product Description text as of 2/2013 are INCORRECT. This safe is 21""w x 10""d x 55""h."
4,Great gun cabinet for a small collection!,"I have 4 rifles and this works perfect. Small enough to not use too much space, yet strong enough to keep nosy kids out. It seems well built with a nice finish. Unlike some, mine arrived via FedEx in perfect condition with no dents or dings. I added some sticky backed felt for the gun props for added protection and will install some thicker foam for the floor soon. For the price and my small collection, this fits my needs perfectly!"
5,There is nothing like model railroading!,"This is a wonderful addition to my collection. I gave 5 stars for educational value because I believe there is so much you can learn from model railroading. History, Math, Science, Culture, Etc. There are so many types of trains from around the world and you get to decide how you want your train world when you build your layout. There really are no rules. You use your IMAGINATION! Very well detailed."
4,Chunky Heavy Blues/Rock/ with a touch of Funk!,"4 Stars = ClassicBlack Cat Bone was a heavy blues/rock power trio out of Kentucky circa 1992. The band played heavy chunky riff based song structures not unlike a combination of Pat Travers & Mountain's heavier moments. Their lead singer is what sets this band apart from other heavy blues rockers, his voice not unlike John Schlitz of Head East. Guitar ace Dave Angstrom is the anchor of this band, his muscular riffing & passionate leads put Black Cat Bone over the top. Later Dave was to lead another killer power trio Supafuzz who put out two albums in 1998 & 2000, which were even more high powered heavy rock with a big emphasis on funk ala' Pat Travers."
2,Almost an unfinished book,"Far from the best AT writing, only about a third of the book was actually about hiking the Trail. The author devotes a third of the book dealing with his life leading up to the hike, and then another third is a sappy love story. The actual descriptions of life on the trail are quite thin, and not too interesting. This ranks at the bottom of the 30 or AT books in my library."
4,"It's really a mellow album,but not great :(","Antony Santos is one of the premier bachateros today, but could we fear that his reign could be ending??? Not really. His 8th album shows why he is still ""El Mayimbe"" with cuts like ""Si Yo Fuera"", ""Me Voy Manana"", and ""Ya No Me Quieres Querer"" with its lyrics full of sentimental thoughts. The Merengues are very good including ""El Ombliguito"" and ""El Quilin Quililan"" with its smooth flavor he only knows how to bring. The only problem with this album is that he went a little to mellow with the bachatas , and they're not really catchy. It has to grow on you, but that's my advice."
1,A real disappointment,This book was a real disappointment. This author appears to be new to the Destroyer series. I'm not sure if he has even read any of the previous books. He got the names of the characters right but that was about it. His writing of the characters was lifeless and inaccurate. Hopefully the publisher will require him to either read some of the previous books or stop writing for the Destroyer series.
2,Here we go again,"Another new writer and another reason for someone to screw with a series that has been in publication since 1972. Too many glairing mistakes, too many changes in the character development,and too many wasted scenes. About the only good thing out of it was a hint on where the series may be going if it can survive another writer who does not understand or care about the story line, the characters or the fans. Pick up your paycheck and let someone in there who can do the job right. I case you think this is harsh I have just started #133 and I am finding the same problems. Chuin help us all!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Just getting started,"Ok this is the first book by a new writer, will let his style and word usage slide for now. There are some changes to the interplay between Remo and Chun, looking to see where that goes. Do not change the character of Remo too much."
1,Pitiful waste of time,Gold Eagle must not have read any reviews. If they did we would not have seen this sad case filler book. At least this time the author didn't have Remo smoking but it is still bad.
3,All Racism Aside,"The review below is historically baseless with the reviewer only considers exceptionally biased sources as valid. 'Politically correct' or not, using biased sources will lead you to biased results and have NO place in serious examination, except as a side note showing prevailing attitudes behind the shameful actions taken by the US against the indigenous population.That said, the book is so so and there are better books out there on the subject."
1,Be wary of this product,I bought this for a trip o Europe. I used it twice and it started to act funny it would turn on but the turn itself off after a few minutes. This continued for a couple of uses then refused to turn on at all. I had two weeks without a curling iron which was not fun. I can't return it as it is over 30 days so will just throw it out.
1,LASTED LESS THAN ONE MONTH,"Ordered 8/7/12, used in Europe where I began having problems with the unit shutting itself off automatically. Would work intermittently. Upon my return to US, the iron continued to shut off - sometimes in a few seconds, sometimes in a few minutes. Tried to return via Amazon, but return window expired 9/12. Called Conair customer service (perfunctory, indifferent service). Warranty service is this: Return item at your expense (I estimated $9.00 to ship parcel post from NC to AZ) PLUS enclose $5 for them to ship you a new one. So, original unit was $23, & I would pay $14. to get a new one - you do the math! It's headed for the trash can & I shall NOT be purchasing anything from CONAIR BABYLISS in the future. Tried to leave seller feedback, but I guess the window is closed on that as well. I am NOT a happy camper on this one!"
3,It's okay,i guess it is not a true ceramic curling iron but it is pretty good and is a good deal for the price
1,good for a while,"After about a year, the ceramic coating starts to wear off. Then it does nothing but fry your hair. Better off spendin your money on a real ceramic iron."
4,Great buy,"I bought this to take with me on my trip to Europe. I really hate hassling with transformers (they rarely fit well, Euro and UK plugs are recessed) and I didn't want to fry my $$$ 110 voltage curling iron, so this fit the bill. They are hardly any ceramic dual voltage curling irons with a variety of sizes to choose from. I think I could only find Babyliss and Ceramic tools. Besides the decent reviews and reasonable price, I ultimately choose this one because of the long barrel. I have long hair and need the room to work my hair."
1,WATCH OUT! THEY DID NOT SHIP A BABYLISS!!,"I ordered a Babyliss Pro Ceramic Tools 1"" curling iron. What I received was a cheaper Conair version. Buyer beware...this is NOT as advertised!I couldn't figure out why this curling iron didn't perform as expected. It LOOKED like the one I had ordered. However, when I finally looked at the manufacturer's label, I found that it was a Conair instead of the Babyliss.I ended up going to Sally Beauty and picking up the CORRECT curling iron. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!"
3,size matters,"This is a high end, professional curling iron, thats ok, but it is huge - anyone looking for a ""travel"" size like I was its about 14"" long with long cord. (yes, it has dual voltage....but)I suggest you put the size of the Iron in your description!! - and not the size of the box it comes in as some descriptions do? (1.5"" x 14"")"
1,Product not received after 2 mths,"I have placed the curling tong on 7th nov, I can't track why or where it really is and there's no updates. This is absurd for an order placed 2 months ago"
2,great curiling iorn,I love this curling iron. I could use it here and abroad. Many settings for all hair. You won't need a transformer for 110 to 220 but you will need a plug adapter for were you are going. I would definitely recommend this product.
4,Dual Voltage,I needed a dual voltage curling iron for a trip to China. It worked as it should...no problems. I would have given it five stars but the heat setting dial was very close to the handle and I kept flipping the setting accidentally.
2,"Eh, not impressed",I'm not impressed. I bought it solely based on the rave reviews. I have thick hair and was hopeful this would help me get some pretty waves/curls but am disappointed.
3,Dual Voltage Curling Iron,Clip part that holds hair in place is not very effective. It is too loose and I had to constantly rewind.
2,So So,Works ok...does not get hot enough so my hair looks good for the first couple hours but not the whole day. Would have been worth it to pay a little more for better quality.
1,Not a BaByliss.,"Described in the title was a BaByliss curling iron, but what I received was a Conair in a BaByliss box."
2,Not Chi,Ordered for my wife for xmas. She likes it but it is not CHI so be mindful of that. Had it gift wrapped when sent so I had no idea it was not what says until she opened it lol.
4,Curls hair well,"Gets hot very fast, but it does keep turning off on its own which is annoying. Just keep an eye on the the red light to see if its on. I just kept pressing the on button every couple if mins so that it wouldn't turn off. Other than that it curled my hair pretty good."
2,Frustrated,"I tried multiple times to get nice waves/curls using this product. I tried using it on clean hair, dirty hair, and with lots of product. I tried changing the length and angle of which I curled my hair. I tried using smaller and larger sections of hair. No matter what I try I can not get this curler to leave me with a decent curl! I am convinced that it is the ceramic plate that prevents me from this effect. Even when set on the highest heat setting, it only gives me the effect of straightening my hair with a slight wave at the ends. I would return this product if I could. I'm going to give it another try but if anyone knows a solution to replacing this curler let me know!"
3,dual voltage hair dryer,"This curling iron was larger than I anticipated. The biggest nuisance is that the heat control dial is located so that when you are curling your hair, it is too easy to hit and change the heat dial."
5,a modern masterpiece,"After seeing the HBO mini-series a few months ago, I immediately bought the soundtrack. I've been a Newman fan for several years, and am familiar with many of his works, and this is his masterpiece. Any fan of his will not be disappointed. It is complex, intricate, moving, and truly captures the spirit and message of the series. Why the Academy has yet to award an Oscar to him is baffling. The best written piece of music of any type that I've heard in years."
5,Marvelous Score,"I've been a fan of Thomas Newman's film scores for a while now, but I believe he's outdone himself with ""Angels in America."" The gorgeous main title track alone is worth the purchase of the disc, but the rest show Newman at his most inventive and effective. It helps if you know the film or even the play. This is a must-have."
3,Angels of America soundtrack missing something special!,"It goes without saying that the music Tom wrote for this movie was amazing but I bought the cd for one reason only. I wanted the Elis Island piece that is on the DVD disc 1 at the end of the movie. It's not on there and it's by far the most beautiful version of that piece of music. I'm very disappointed. It only has the short version without the background violins and the effect on the lead obo. I hate it when they change things from what the movie has as a soundtrack. Needless to say, I didn't waste my money as I like all the music on the cd enough to buy it."
4,Angels in America,This is Thomas Newman at his very best with lush orchestration and sublime chords that are his trademark. The eerie vocals add a somewhat mysterious flavour to the album and embellish it enormously. Can't wait to now see the film .
5,Undoubtedly the best chess book ever written,"I have read hundreds of chess books in my life and this is without question my favorite. It is both entertaining and instructive, whether you're a ""c"" player or a master, and I especially liked the colorful intros to each game by Larry Evans. As a bonus you get a sense of Fischer's wit and candor which comes through in his analysis throughout the book.One word of caution, the new revised book has been changed dramatically, so dont buy the algebraic edition."
5,I've been waiting many years for this book!,"This book was previously out of print and very difficult to find for many years. The annotations are by Fischer himself and are deeply instructive and entertaining. I play through the games, covering the moves with a card, and try to guess Fischer's next move. If you do this, all phases of your game will improve - the opening, the middlegame, and the endgame. This book is easily one of the best chess books ever printed. If you are serious about chess, you simply must own this classic."
2,Bad description of book,"The book is pretty good unless, like me, the main reason you bought it is because the description claims that it includes Fisher's famous ""Game of the Century"". That game is NOT in this book. After I bought it I contacted Amazon customer service and they gave me a refund, so I have no complaint about Amazon, but this book is NOT as described. I also later found another review here that says that the ""Game of the Century"" is not in the book, so it is not just my copy."
2,Don't be fooled,This is NOT the authentic My 61 Memorable Games that everyone is talking about. Don't be fooled into thinking that it is.
5,WoW,Please I dont have to talk much...a book written by the great bobby fishers...I highly recommended to anyone and all chess players know it since the book runs out easily :D
4,Good Overview of the books of the Bible,"This book has a good, concise overview of the books of the Bible and how they relate to today's world. The writing is good and easy to understand."
3,Follow the Dots to Dazzling Quilts,The book was disappointing as I expected more appealing and varied patterns. I found one pattern I am interested in making.
5,The best grunge (plus post-punk) album out there,If for whatever reason you are reading this (linked to grunge...who knows): buy this album. Why this band did not become a serious force in early-90s music is inexplicable. Think: a more reliable Mudhoney.
3,So so...,"Writerights are great protectors and definetely improve handwriting. On the other hand, they do reduce the brilliance and sharpness of the display! The other downfall, is that they don't seem to quite last a month if you use your PDA constantly like I do. They scuff up very easily and need changed often."
5,Unsung Heroes,This concise history of the Navajo servicemen who provided invaluable aid during WWII in the Pacific is quite readable and fascinating.
3,cheap,"just don't examine too closely, cheap band, plasticky look, great to wear if worried about getting mugged, i.e. who cares"
5,A nice fun way of learning and applying technical analysis,"I found the structure of this computer based guide to technical analysis to be very userfriendly and interactive. After learning about an indicator I could ""see"" how to use the indicator and even better than that I could tweak the parameters to perform my own technical analysis on provided data. A unique book worth it's price."
