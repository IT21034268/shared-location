2,"Waste of money, poor design.","The idea behind these bowls is interesting, but they are a huge fail. My twins tried them a few times, but the rubbery lids would get stretched and cereal would still fall out. Sometimes little hands got stuck in the lid and they couldn't get them back out. It's much easier to just make a plate on the coffee table and let them go at it."
5,Love these!,"I purchased 2 of these a few months ago and I love them. They are great for out and about and I purchased the snap on lid so I just keep in diaper bag full. I am buying more because I lost one and I cannot live with out several for home and out, helps keep my floors clean! Some of the other brands reviews say kids got lids off, my daughter never has and I dont think she could as its on there good."
4,Must have for moms on the go.,"Snack traps are an essential for moms on the go. They are not completely spill proof but they have seriously cut down the amount of Cheerios, Goldfish, or raisins I find in the back seat of my car. They are easy for my 3 year old to get his hand in and out of and he loves the cute designs.The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is they are not entirely dishwasher friendly. The bowl part washes fine but the plastic lid turns yellow and dingy looking after being washed. I have resorted to washing them by hand which is not a big deal but just wanted to give you a heads up."
1,Cute but doesn't work.,"The goldfish crackers and cheerios still fell out. The lid is also easily removed by a toddler. While it is a cute cup, it is does not function as a snack trap."
2,Not Worth It,"The only thing that's getting trapped here are the parents buying this thing.Our daughter is 16 months old and we just bought this snack trap yesterday. Within probably 10 minutes, she figured out how to spill out the treats through the flaps on the lid. She has also figured out how to completely remove the lid and spill all of them everywhere. What's the point exactly??"
1,Not great for delicate hands,"The lids on these containers are ridiculously rough, and actually hurt my sons hands when he would try to reach in for his snack. I even tried it, and really does hurt. The lid needs to be made of a softer rubber, like that of the munchkin brand containers."
1,"Good concept, bad design","My 11 month old daughter removed the lid within minutes and I had Cheerios everywhere. Since then if she doesn't take off the lid, she shakes it upside down to get the Cheerios out and scatters them everywhere that way.I'll keep looking for a snack cup that she can use without making a mess."
1,"loved the idea, hated the product","It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time, he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere. I tried it a few more times after that and got same result. The lid is WAY too easy to remove."
5,Must have for Toddlers!,I love the Snack Trap! Wonderful tool - They prevent snacks from being spilled about. I have also found that they slow my dogs down in their attempt to steal my son's snacks. They are especially handy in the car so that you do not end up with crackers everywhere except your childs mouth. Now this does not prevent the kids from taking the crackers/snacks out with their little hands and throwing them about.Great purchase - a must buy for a baby/toddler gift!
2,Didn't work for us.........,"I bought this recently for my 13 month old after seeing it finally being sold in BRU.....I was really excited! Turns out, i think maybe my child thinks its a toy. He loves to press down one of the ""flaps"" and watch all the cheerios fall out as he's shaking it. I've stopped using it bcuz the snacks don't just ""trail"" behind him, they are all over the place. So...what's the point of this? I spend most of my time picking up cheerios. I might as well just scatter cheerios on the floor myself if i want to offer some to him! I give it 2 stars bcuz its a great idea but it just didnt work for us."
3,Design Flaw,"Trap (def.) - a device designed to prevent gas, vapor, or other substances passing through or escaping from something.A ""trap"" should have a secure lid, perhaps one that screws on, snaps, or has a button release. Otherwise it doesn't really meet the definition of a trap."
2,Looked like a good idea...,"I think the general idea of these is great. For the first 2 minutes, I thought we had a winner...then my 18 month old pulled off the lid with his teeth, and his snack was all over the floor. If they came with screw-on lids, then I think they'd be perfect...as is, they are useless to me."
2,What a mess,"What a mess! Every time we give this to our 14 month old, the car, house, stroller, etc. ends up littered with cheerios. Very disappointed with this cup's ability to contain its contents. Any toddler inclined to wave this around or shake it will delight in their new found ability to make a mess."
1,Sounds like a good idea but really a complete waste...,"The idea sounded intriguing so I figured I'd give it a try. To my suprise these cups gave me even more work. My son easily took the top off of it after I made sure it was on very secure and had a blast shaking his cup full of cheerios all over my entire car. So, I figured OK, let me try one more time just at the off chance I didn't have the top on perfectly. Nope, same thing. A complete waste. We threw ours in the garbage, no luck here on these."
4,Cute,"These are a nice thing for kids to have so they can carry around their snacks without spilling all over the floor. It takes a few minutes for them to figure out how to get stuff out, but start with a favorite treat and they'll pick up on it pretty quickly. Easy to clean, etc. However, once they learn to pull off the lids, its just like any other little plastic cup!"
3,Not effective for toddlers,I bought these for small snacks or cereal for my 2 year old twins. They immediately figured out how to take the lid off and rendered these useless for me. Maybe they work for younger children but for my needs they did not work.
3,Really needs additional lid for storage,"The snack traps are great for when the child is eating, but there is no other additional lid (without the hole on top) for storage. Therefore, if you put the snack trap in the diaper bag and it tips over, half the food comes out (which has happen to me more times than I can count) because the regular lid has a small hole. Also, if you leave the snack trap in the kitchen filled with food and forget to take the food out, the snacks get stale. I would give this 5 stars IF the cups came with additional solid lid that could be used for storage or for putting the cups in a bag. I have to give it 3 stars because I've found too many cheerios at the bottom of the diaper bag from the cups tipping over."
2,lid doesn't stay on,"I was so excited about this item. It even worked when my son was about 12 months old. We lost it, and bought a new one when he was about 21 months old. By then, he could easily pull the lid off and dump the contents of the cup all over. I would love to see the same item with a screw-top lid. Yes, a toddler could still probably shake some food out the top but it would be a few pieces, not the entire cupfull."
1,didn't hold the snacks!,My son figured out how to dump all the cheerios out of this container within 5 seconds. Unfortunately it was not the anti-spill container that it advertised.
4,Got a toddler? Get these.,"I don't know why I didn't buy these sooner. I can give them to my 18 month old son, and it takes considerably less time for him to dump them all over the place and trash the back seat! He loves being able to eat independently, rather than have me dole out one goldfish at a time. Well worth the money."
2,Great - for 3 days,I thought this was the greated product on earth until 3 days after we had them my baby was taking the lid off and throwing cereal all over the house.....o well back to the search for a real spill proof snack cup
2,Messy cup,"I saw 5 moms go wild for this cup in the baby feeding section of a store. The moms claimed it was the best invention ever and a worker said she can't keep them in stock. I looked at this thing and thought my 9 month old would get his hand stuck in the plastic that was cut into wedges that are for keeping in the snack. I saw several moms pick up 2 at a time so I decided to get one. Later that day I filled up the cup with cheerios and my son had grasped the cup by the lip, holding down the plastic wedges and began to dump out his snack. I thought this was just a one time accident and gave it to him several days later. He played with the plastic wedges pushing them down, then held the cup again by the lip holding the plastic wedges down and turned the cup up side down shaking his cheerios out all over the floor. That day it ended up in the bathtub without the plastic cover and he taught himself how to drink using this cup with handles."
2,Plastic top hurts my hands,This product is more of a Chinese finger trap than anything else. The three pack came as a two pack and an additional single cup. Only one of the three had a lid that would hold in the snacks.
1,product has changed,"We use to swear by the snack trap. I had two left over from my five year old daughter that I was using with my younger daughter, unfortunately we lost both of them. I bought a new pack of 3 and the new lids are tough and sharp. My daughter couldn't get the snack out without hurting her hand (the lid also hurt my hand). They have changed the material of the lids, I am totally bummed! I returned the pack for a refund."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess."
3,"Great concept, but....","The idea behind the Snack Trap is fantastic, but as the other reviewers have stated, the lid does not attach securely enough. I know it is just a matter of time before my little one pulls it off and I'm right back to where I started!"
4,Works well for my daughter,"I had been looking for a product for when we're driving that won't get the snack all over the place. This does pretty well at keeping it contained; sometimes there are still goldfish crackers in my 2yr old daughter's carseat - but that's more because of her and not the container! This does the best job that I could find - an open container just does not work! The only thing ""negative"" is that is does seem to ""scrape"" her fingers. And I hesitate to even say ""scrape"" because it's not a true scrape, but after using this her fingers are red and raw. Other than that it's a pretty useful product."
3,I'm still cleaning up after him,"Although my 19 month old can't dump the all his OsOs on the floor, there's still a trail around him. Not a perfect item but OK."
4,It works!!,"My 20 mo old daughter used it this morning for the first time. So far, it is working. No more spills. She even used that for her candies. The lid looks as if it can come off easily but even my ever curious daughter has not taken in off herself and it did not come off when the cup was dropped on the floor umpteen times."
3,I use this all the time... but it could be better designed,"I use this all the time for the 14 month old. He figured out how to use it pretty quickly when we first introduced it to him when he was about 10 months old. However, he always spills the cereal or snacks all over the place. Though it's a great container and better than an open mouthed cup, it doesn't allow for him to reach in a grab his snack easily. He's always pulling out other pieces with each hand full and those go all over the place."
3,It's a great idea BUT...,"I think this cup would be better for babies older than my one year old. The rubber lid hurts his little hands when he pulls out the snacks. It would be better if it were a little softer and if it came with a solid lid to store snacks longer term. It's a great idea, and I like the cup, but I will wait and re-introduce it in a few months."
3,Waste of Money,"My friend recommended these to me when I began feeding my son solids (cheerios and other snacks). The idea is cute, but it just wasnt comfortable for me. My son figured out how to take the lid off as well as taking half of the food out at once, so it made lots of mess. Its also not comfortable to have in your diaper bag. I tried using the link rings and attach it to his stroller but the food tends to spill out. Overall it was just a waste of money, switched back to ziplock bags and its been almost a year and found nothing that can beat the ziplocks."
1,there's better,Not worth the money or trouble. The lids are so tough that my little trapped his fingers constantly and was alwasy in tears. Gerber now has some great ones out!
4,Great compilation!!,"This is the best compilation I own. I purchased this CD after hearing ""Electra"" by Airstream on Sirius, satellite radio. ""Electra"" is a very sexy instrumental ballad. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the rest of these CDs are. I have a strong preference for Disc 2 but if you are into the ""Chill out"" genre I would give these a listen. I'm patiently waiting for volume 2 but it doesnt appear to be for sale in the USA."
4,A respectful and decent view of Africa,"This book by Achebe and Lyons is infact a decent and respectful view of Africa.It does not contain pictures of Starving children or wars.The photographs taken by Lyon shows ordinary Africans going about their business with dignity.There is also a very good essay by Achebe discussing the Images of Africa over time.It uses as it's main theme a discussion of Joseph Conrad's book the heart of darkness.He does not shy away from issues such as slave trade and wars,but he treats the subject of Africa's image with dignity.There are also a number of poems after a few pictures.The pictures are about 100. My only grouse with the book is that no pictures were taken of Nigeria and South Africa which are indeed countries that show all the contradictions and hopes of Africa.I say this mainly for sentimental reasons being a Nigerian i would have loved a picture of the hustle and bustle of Ojuelegba in Lagos or the Onitsha market.It is however a welcome addition to my library."
5,Aly on tour Doll,This is a fun doll. It comes with a bunch of acessories. Brush Microphone poster card of Aly and stickers and a guitar for Aly to play with a guitar pick. I am really sattisfied with this doll and I may get the Aj on tour doll maybe this fall.
4,It's a textbook,"As far as history textbooks are concerned, I like this one. Yes, it's dense, but it's dense subject matter. The book is a lot less dry than it could be. Yes, the book is biased, but that can lead to interesting class discussion (or just plain thought), especially if one reads other essays/books on the subjects.I'm trying to imagine a better constitutional history textbook and I can't, though I will not claim to be an expert on history textbooks. At least this one gives plenty of information to understand the history that surrounds the Supreme Court cases. Everything's nice, connected, and easy to understand--if a bit dense."
1,Can't be more biased,I was assigned this book for a class in law school (legal history). I was surprised when I realized how biased and slanted it was. I have never read a textbook this biased before. Believe my shock at being assigned this. I also find that the authors skip over important parts of history that are at odds with their views. Just a poor poor book.
1,Booooring!,"Avoid this book! It will kill your interest in US History. It is a bad attempt at summarizing the events which shaped the Constitution. While it made a good point at stressing the importance of our ""British Heritage"", especially when it comes to the legal system in our country, the author brought in too much of his own bias (as another reviewer has pointed out). I think the accompanying text to this book, Documents of American Constitutional and Legal History, is better. It at least lets you draw your own conclusions from original texts."
3,Formatting?,"While I am sure this is a great devotional - I will likely NOT purchase in Kindle edition. I've downloaded a sample and the scripture referenced for each reading, included with the devotion is in such a tiny typesize! And, unlike the rest of the book, it is not re-sizable. For the first time, I'm very disappointed with my Kindlability! I do, however want this book, so I guess I will spend more money to get it in paper - oh well!"
5,Great aid for a refreshing time with God,"This is a different type of devotional that I find very helpful in learning to listen for God during one's ""quiet time"". Most devotionals have a verse of Scripture and maybe an inspirational story which is fine but one can read through those and still not really have quieted their spirit and tried to hear what God might be saying to them through His Word.I bought three of these for my sons ages 17, 19, and 21. They have also liked the format and it is the first thing that they have really stuck with and enjoyed.I think Eugene Peterson offers just the right amount of comments to stimulate your thinking but not so much that it overpowers what God might be trying to say.I would recommend this to anyone ages 15 and up."
2,Disappointing format,"I was hoping to have this book on my Kindle. I love The Message translation and was looking forward to the daily readings and the guidance in the lectio divina method of Bible reading and prayer. However the format makes this book basically unreadable on the Kindle. The Scripture passages are in a much smaller font than the rest of the text and cannot be enlarged by using the formatting menu. There are places where for no apparent reason the font size changes and one verse will have a larger size. Though I can read the Scripture it is small enough to be a struggle.If I decide to get this book I will look at the printed versions, but I am disappointed because I was looking forward to having a daily devotional guide on my Kindle."
2,Exclusive Language--Ouch!,"After a couple of weeks usingThe Message//Remix:Solo:The Uncommon Devotional I am going to put the book in my Goodwill box. The exclusive language for God of ""He, He, He"" is too bothersome to me and I find it influencing my image of God. I think the devotional exercises are useful and imaginative, not the usual ""everything turns out rosy"" sort of devotions but the language of the text is unnecessarily male imagery of God. I was familiar with The Message, having read it entirely, but I had missed this aspect until now. I can no longer recommend it to parishioners without a disclaimer about the language. I do not advocate for the complete exclusion of God as ""He"" but The Message//Remix: Solo: The Unccommon Devotional has no sensitivity to the idea of God as person."
2,Kindle review - unusable Table of Contents,"I've been waiting a long time for this devotional to come out on kindle. I excitedly downloaded it. The type size IS good and can be magnified (this must have been improved since other kindle reviews). However, there is no usable ToC. Instead, you have to navigate to the ""end"" of the ebook ,back track many pages to find an Index, where you can navigate to specific devotions by topic. However, there is no ordinary ToC at the start of the book. Though better than nothing, the Index has 19 pages that you must screen through to see all the topics. There is no ToC by scripture reference. The ""Message Solo New Testament"" is a better kindle purchase. It has the contents at the start (by scripture) as well as the ""Index"" at the end (by topic)."
4,Great Devotional,"Good devotional. I like that it guides you through your quiet time with God. Read, Think, Pray, Live."
4,Message Bible,"Loved this Bible. Everyday language, easy to understand. I also loved the feel of this book. It is easy to carry in my purse too."
5,The Best!,This is the best devotional I have ever used. It is very contemplative and simple. Eugene Peterson draws yu into the scripture like no other devotional. I recommend it without reservation.
4,Building a relationship with God,A fresh way to help readers get different perspectives and stimulate their relationship with God. It is short and sweet for those with little time as well as those who are trying to get to know God.
1,Not worth it!,"All of the information that is in this book can be had by googling ""bluegrass jamming"" and then spend 30 minutes reading.Also, I go to bluegrass jams all of the time and never hear half of these songs played. This book seems to me to have been quickly thrown together and titled to attract people brand new to jamming.I'll save you the time....here's what the book says: Learn to look at a guitar players hand to recognize chord changes and don't be rude in a jam. The rest is just teaching you (very weak) note for note versions of some tunes that you can, and should, learn by ear."
5,Wonderful Husband,"My wonderful husband bought these for me for Christmas and they are beautiful. I haven't taken them off since I got them. BTW, the screw back on these is thicker than normal earring posts so be ready for that."
5,Too much fun!,"This is a great game for puzzle lovers. I got hooked, got my mom/sister/brother/nine year old son hooked. The premise is very simple, just one or two controls to remember when playing, but the combinations start out fun and then get better. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes shanghai, tetris, or logic/puzzles."
5,Wonderful!,This is such a great game. I'm a 22 year old female who is addicted to puzzle games for Gameboy. I got this one and cannot stop playing it! It has a password feature so you don't have to keep going through levels that you've already completed. I highly suggest it if you like puzzle games!!
5,Kids love it,My kids have loved this cd (ages 8 and 6). I put it in one night as they were going to sleep. And I never heard any complaints from them about it. All of Jim Weiss' cds that we have have been wonderful. I enjoy the way my children get to learn about history through this cd.
4,Good but more advanced than some of his other recordings,"First let me say we have either bought or borrowed at least 6 or 7 of Jim's recordings. My 5 son has enjoyed his knights of the round table, robin hood and guliver's travel CDs for more than year. His pre-k teacher did an extended lesson Lincoln about presidents day and my son became very interested in Lincoln. A a result, I purchased this CD. However, unlike some his other recordings, I think one is for an older audience. I hope when he's older he will enjoy this as well."
1,Not for pros,"Very general overview of the workout process. Basic concepts. If you have ever worked in restructuring credits, this one is not for you. If on the other hand you know nothing about workouts, pick it up, although [] there are much better buys. Come to think of it, should have bought my better half a nice present instead, why don't you?"
4,commercial dance,"A great double album with a great deal of European content that can only be described as inspiring. The tracks vary in tempo from music that wouldn't be out of place in some Bohemian lounge to full Ibiza anthems - something only truely experienced when the stereo is real loud!! Sample Gee has mixed the tracks very well with the playlist giving variety and interest, which makes this Largered CD and the rest in the Lagered series stand out from the crowd of compilation CDs. Kiwi's rock hard"
1,You get what you pay for.,"This keyboard is a major disappointment. The keys are rubbery with no tactile feedback whatsoever. Some keys require more pressure than others. If you're a touch typist, get the Targus stowaway instead. Over twice the price but there's no comparison. The split on this keyboard places the ""H"" key on the left side making it a long reach. Also the plastic ridge on the leading edge makes for an uncomfortable typing position as hitting the spacebar requires reaching over the lip. The connector and stand for the iPAQ is flimsy. I'd rather use the on screen keyboard or transcriber instead of this product."
3,economical solution to screen taps,"This keyboard has a great price with some compromises. It's larger than the one sold by Compaq and the keys are sticky and don't click. You can't use it with the expansion pack attached. Also, the documentation wasn't the greatest. I'm not sure it will be compatible with Pocket PC 2002.On the other hand, when folded, it's smaller than my iPaq. It didn't use a lot of power and the keys were negotiable.I bought this keyboard because I was on my way to Callifornia and wanted to take only my iPaq. It was worth it to have the keyboard - editing my papers was easier. I will probably buy a full size keyboard in the future, but now I can wait for the price to come down.I don't recommend this product if you like the click of a traditional keyboard. Otherwise it's good if you're flexible and economics are an issue."
2,oh dear,"not bad, although not for touch typists. Biggest failing is inability to connect ipaq with expansion sleeve connected, as per other reviewer. Just has to go back to the store for that reason. I thought I might be able to 'adjust' it, but nothing doing.... Shame really 'cause for the price against the Targus, it could be a great alternative"
1,Lost....,"Shortly after I purchased this keyboard I installed it and used it briefly. The next time I tried to use it it failed to work, and when I try to use the ""keyboard.exe"" to initialize it fails to recognize it and it generates an error. When it worked it was too small for normal typing but a lot better than the on-screen keyboard. I can't even remove the drivers for it."
3,plate cover,When i get it wao very light wait easy to useit but in the sunshine state the red color after few months change to light orange sun not so good for the frame but was a fast delivery and if u leave other state be perfect
1,Disappointed,I have tried many of the recipes in this book and all but one (the green pea soup) turned out quite bad. I cook regularly and enjoy Indian food. While the photos are nice they do not represent the boring mush that I ended up with. I recent bought another indian cookbook and have gotten 100% success there. I recommend you find another option if you want to cook rather than look and pictures.
1,"A piece of junk, if you have the Samsung E105.","I bought the software to create ringtones for my Samsung E105. After spending several hours playing with it, I found the following problems:1. Cannot create .mmf format, which is what the E105 supports.2. Cannot detect the infrared port/device. I tried the software on a Dell Latitude that has IR port and put the E105 right next to it but software can't detect anything.I don't know how well the software works with other phones but with mine, it's a complete waste of time.My solution will be get some conversion software that can deal with .mmf format, then a USB data cable and do my own transfer."
1,Don't bother,This program does not work with Razor phones. Says it does but the phone is not listed. Free ring tones are horrible. Can't get my music onto phone no matter what I tried.
2,mostly junk,"this was a waste of money, mostly junk you can't get onto your phone. I downloaded better FREE stuff from ringtone websites!"
1,Don't buy this Junk,"I bought this program about a week before I upgraded to Vista and it stopped working. Customer service responded a week later by saying that it will not work with Vista. They offered no help and no refund. They did, however, ask me buy more of their products."
1,Beware vague and misleading feature description,"Nowhere in the item description does it mention that this cable has a female 9-pin serial adapter. It is not USB.The description CLAIMS compatibility with Mac OS 8.6 and above. But current Macs don't have 9-pin serial ports. The last Mac that had one was the Mac 512Ke, discontinued 16 years ago! But that model accepted 9-pin MALE connectors, and it certainly can't run Mac OS 8.6! Maybe this product works for PCs, but the description is at best misleading, and at worst, flat-out wrong."
4,Cheap and does all it's supposed to do.,"Nothing fancy here: just a simple serial cable, just like the Palm OEM (Palm M100 never came with a USB link!). True, it has no start button, but one is hardly needed: just click on the HotSync icon in the application to start the sync. Duh! (Whether your cable has a start button, like the Palm OEM, or not, like this one, you still must set the HotSync preferences to ""Local"" and ""Direct Serial."") For putting up with this ""deficit"" you will save 2/3!"
5,A book to read again and again...,"I have read this book over and over again and each time I take away something different. It is the type of book that lets you see something about your own life each time you read it. If you are into art you will enjoy picking out the real life artists that she has woven in to her story. I love the little biographies in the middle of the book, it is a wonderful celebration of artists as real people and not just their most famous work. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has the soul of an artist."
4,Only the 2nd book that I have ever read twice.,"Mr.Brown, need to speak with you; reach me at e_melchor@yahoo.co"
3,PLEASANT,"I love playing Monopoly and can destroy anyone who challenges me. But what do I do when [others] are too scared to play me? I play this. I wasn't sure if this would be good or bad and was suprised it was not that bad. Still, it is a bit easy but when yur board this will take up some time. I prefer playing the real version but this game is pleasant."
3,A Reissue,"I read this book back in 1988 when it was first published. Having forgotten this, I purchased this newly reissued edition. I really wish publishers would make it clear right up front (on the cover) that these books have been previously published. This is a good story, but not worth reading a second time."
3,Entertaining,"While it is clear that Paretsky used the story to pontificate around the abortion issue, the story was not (in my opinion) held hostage by her views. Of course, she must have known that those who hold opposing views might be somewhat derailed by her machinations. Apparently she felt it was a risk worth taking. For my part, the story was entertaining and amusing. There were sufficeint plot twists and turns, a romantic interlude, loveable yet annoying characters... all the stuff that makes us enjoy V.I. This is what I call hot-fudge-sundae fiction. I read it for its entertainment value--not intellectual nutrition. YUM!"
4,I like V.I. but would not like living with her.,"I likie Sara's writing even with the wearing use of minucia about streets and Chicago sights. V.I. is always hurt from her miscalculations, and lack of preparations. How many detectives can't figure out how to keep private private. She's continually attacked in her own home and almost violently cross with her friends. She finds solutions that come up to the reader a beat before the text reveals the important infomation. The basic good writing keeps me reading. V.I. is at heart a bleeding heart and for that she is forgiven her bad character. I keep going back since I like the writing, seems contradictory but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."
3,Partially spoiled by later books in the series,"It's not all that big a deal, but there is one element in this book that will alert those who have read later books that something's going to happen to one specific important character.As noted by another reviewer, Sara Paretsky does use this book to strongly express her pro-choice views. I don't mean to be critical by pointing this out, but strong anti-abortionists will likely be made angry by this book.That said, this is one of the weaker books in the series. If you are a fan of V. I. Warshawski, then by all means read this one. But if you're not a strong fan, or haven't yet read any in the series, I suggest starting with one of her other books such as the first, INDEMNITY ONLY."
2,Bad medicine,"Almost interesting, but finally wraps up with stock villians and an implausable resolution. The fact that this is set entirely in the world of doctors and hospitals, healthcare economics, which Ms Paretsky obviously does not understand, dooms the story."
3,Bitter Medicine a Bit Sugary,Good storyline but characters sometimes difficult to discern. Story a little choppy; not as tight as it could be; somewhat maudlin but still it holds the interest until you discover whodunit
2,Politics over Plotting,"I have read all of the Sara Paretsky mysteries, and think this is the weakest of the group. She maintains her writerly skill, but the plot in this novel feels like it was devised to make a political point about women's access to health care and particularly to abortion. In the process, she takes pot shots at her political opponents by making the characters of those who disagree with her unidimensional, manipulative, and unlikeable. The novel does have suspenseful elements, but not enough, and I just didn't buy the story. If you want to read all the books in the series, this is readable. If you're picking the best, go with Hard Time or Tunnel Vision."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased this movie thinking that it would be like the movie ""The Sandlot,"" but for soccer. Wow, was I wrong. This movie was terrible. First, the film was dubbed over in English so it was distracting to watch and the story itself was bad! I was expecting something based on the first WSB book, but this one was about Vanessa (one of the soccer players) leaving the bunch to date ""The Pale Vampire,"" who was a skater kid. About 10 minutes of the movie were spent playing soccer and the rest was about Vanessa leaving the group and what the group was going to do about it. There was also a fair amount of time spent on witchcraft..there was a scene where The Pale Vampire sacrifices the soccer ball to this statue of a witch and then the WSB tries to get Vanessa and the field back by using witch-like creatures. I am hoping to return this, it was truly awful."
1,MAJOR RIPOFF!!!,"This is NOT a US release of ""The Wild Soccer Bunch"", as we were led to believe --- it is one of the later episodes. Episode One is the only one not released with English subtitles, so people who expected to be able to finally enjoy the whole series have been doubly duped --- by not getting what we ordered, and by ending up with a useless spare copy of a later episode.Avoid this item...and avoid dealing with a producer who rips off customers like this!!!!!"
5,Excellent tranquility,"Gromer Khan excels with space hotel. It is far more superior to Sufi & Kamasutra. Its deeply meditative with its echoing sitars & wind like synthesizers, while the percussion add an element of mystery & dimensional border to it. It must be listened to for appreciation.It definitely is not for an upbeat mood, it needs some emptiness to fill, to drive away those heavy clouds inside, very plesant indeed."
2,A good idea but self conscious and lacking in subtlety,"I sympathise with the theme of this novel and I really wanted to like it. The ugly face on neo liberalism should be exposed more often. Unfortunately, the exploration of the idea is studded with cliches and the writing is often too self consciously cute for comfort - Billy Bragg songs cover the same territory with far greater ease."
5,not very happy,"I ordered this CD as a gift for my father. I was so disappointed when I received Relax with the Classics ""Spiritual"". The paperwork that accompanied the CD was correct but the CD was not. I have re-ordered the CD with hopes it makes it to me before father's day."
4,Rule the Freakin Markets,I have been an investor for many hears and have read alot of inventment books and this is a good one.
1,Michael Parness = Wade C(r)ook?,"I considered buying ""Rule the Freakin' Markets"" until I read a review comparing the author to Wade C(r)ook. That was all I needed to know."
5,Excellent resource for the newbie trader,"Waxie says it like it is, which you won't get in the mainstream financial media. There are a lot of ""experts"" out there spewing nonsense about all the good investments out there, while their stock picks take a beating. I wonder about their real agenda. Waxie is one of the few people that I know of that tells the complete truth about Wall Street.With all the shenanigans currently going on Wall Street, being a stock investor is foolish. Trading is the safest way to make money in the stock market. This book is an excellent start for the newbie trader."
2,don't bother,"I have read many books on investing and trading. If you want solid information buy Van Tharp or Schwager's books and leave this one alone. Very basic, nothing serious. Another pop culture phenom who made money by being clever enough to work both sides of a bubble market. When do you think we'll get another one of those? In one section he says that a drug company with promising phase 1 results still might need a year before the drug in question comes to market. Really, a year to sail through phases 2 and 3? You could buy any Peter Lynch book and learn more that you can use. I read slow and read this in one day. This guy either got lucky or was far more aggressive than most of us could be and live to tell about."
2,Where's the beef?,"The general information in this book is excellent. But if the reader is yearning to learn how to trade - if the reader wants to learn just how he can 'rule the freakin' markets - then he must look elsewhere.This book is an easy and pleasant read. It tells Parness' story and how he made a success of trading. But if you want to learn how to copy his success, you won't find the answers here. Foe example, his rules on how to enter and exit a trade are so vague, they are of little practical value.This is the first negative review I've ever wriitten, and I'm sad to do it."
5,The proof is in the pudding...,"I almost didn't buy Rule The Freakin' Markets because ofsome apparently ignorant comments here. Yes, there is someoverhypying going on, but it seems to me to be all in FUN.Bottom line is that the book is informative, activeand better than anything else out there I've read.The negative comments seem to come from people who haven'tread the book! A review from someone who hasn't read the book?That seems odd, no?"
3,Not Thrilled With This Book,Mr. Parness sounds like someone who can do something but he cannot effectively teach it. One example is his explanation of the 10:00 am rule. It may be clear to him what the 10:00 am rule is but I had to read it several times before I could understand it. It still seems fuzzy.He has some good ideas but he should consider using a ghost writer for his next book. I would still recommend this book to someone who is interested in trading for a living.
1,Get Cramer's Real Money For A Light Hearted Approach To The Market,"It was not exactly pump and dump; it was kind of like group buying. This is what happened back with the free chatroom. A stock would be accumulated by certain people. Then the rest of the chatroom would be informed about it. Then you are on your own, but they would get angry if you sold before them. I know people who sent stock tips to certain people. He told them it looked like a dud. A few days later that very same stock would be recommended to the group. Are you starting to figure out the trends now?As indicated in other reviews, certain techniques simply do not work or the ""trends"" that can make you money are non-existent in today's market."
1,waste of freakin' time,"I learned nothing new from this book. Although his writing style is different, he managed to say the exact same thing that has already been said by enough other people that are more qualified to say it. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Even Investors Should Read It,"Parness is a trader, but the concepts he talks about hold true for investors as well, especially in bad markets. Most people don't realize the negative impact drawdowns have on their account, and fail to address this issue. Parness does, and investors should take hee. Also, any investor who is basing their decisions solely on fundamentals should think again, and read Parness' trade philosophy, (and learn charting and market analysis through sites like Tradingmarkets.com). He wrote the book in a much better market than the current environment (7/02) so it seems easier, but the concepts still apply. I'd recommend it."
1,Con artist,Pile of generally known principles assembled in this book will most certainly not make money for anybody. But Waxie will be rich if you let him to con you into subscribing to his expensive and useless web site. It is a shame to see this useless book together with the books written by serious authors.
5,The truth is in the pudding!,"For all the naysayers, the truth is that Michael Parness and hisbook are like having the ""nuts"" in poker! While the book is definately slanted toward newbies, its still an impressive book, full of fun facts and amazing money making ideas. As far as his stats go, I tracked several months worth of his trades and the guy is beyond amazing. While the book doesn't give actual trades, it does give trades that are likely to come up in every day trading. This book is worth its weight in GOLD. Don't believe the hype, the truth is in the pudding!"
3,A Wild & Crazy Guy,"While the claims in this book are not highly substantiated, you've got to love a guy who expresses his opinion of stock brokers simply as ""Brokers Suck."" Much of the book is stuff you will find in any decent book on investing, i.e., managing risk, controlling your emotions, and a couple of ways to pick stocks. But, one has to give Michael an 'A' for expressing himself in a direct and refreshingly 'in-your-face' style.If you are serious in wanting to learn more about investing, there are other books that will give you more bang for your buck. Authors like Leslie Masonson, Deborah Weir, Toni Turner and Josh Lukeman give you more useful information for your hard-earned money."
1,childish jibberish,"A complete and total waste of time;(...) A completely uninformative stock market 101 book that reiterates the same old, stale admonitions about not letting emotions get the best of you, let your profits run, etc. No cogent examples, no detailed explanations examining technical analysis, fundamental analysis, random walk theory or any of the essential elements absolutely necessary to survive as a trader/investor. Simply a binder with pages sewn in-between. For those who are serious about trading, 3 books which are a must are Marcel Link, David Nassar and for the more advanced day trader, Secrets of the Underground Trader. As for the reviewed book, It's a Freakin Waste of Time."
3,Good book ... but please save the hype!,"Michael Parness tells a decent tale. His writing is motivational and irreverent .. his advice sound. However, his advice is a bit trite and often Mr. Parness comes across as a bit of a jackass.I have read his book and even been a member of his web site. His daily emails eventually turned me off. This is a situation of hyping ones good calls and burying the bad calls.I prefer accountability in stock advice (like SageTrade.com) where both winners and losers are honestly documented! Mr. Parness could take a lesson in understatement and credibility from such sites."
4,This is for beginners! please understand that,"I read alot of negative reviews 1 star etc. everything is saying it's rubbish doesn't teach anything new..well I think the book is for beginners not for advanced traders.I have read the book and I would say for a beginner its a good, quick read.for advanced traders.. pass on it..yes parness is selling his website and his tapes in the books, but he doesnt over sell it like some other books..sure he wrote the book to profit from his success but lets not hate him for that, anyone would do the same..yes he doesnt talk about how he made the money, he should of ran through his trades, his shorts, options, calls and puts, etc.. but he doesnt even mention the trades or the stocks..still for me,its like watching a movie which you didnt find that good, you paid your money, ate your popcorn had a few laughs and then went home...if you are a noob, read it you wont be disappointed.. if you are an experienced trader, then pass it..."
1,Not a case - BEWARE!!,"This is not a case of briefs. This is ONE PACKAGE OF 16. The description is deceptive, and I am returning them. DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,quantitative,"this is a very quantitative approach to operations management in a large scale business. Everything can be broken down into equations, even human labor. While the book had some interesting approaches to large scale business operations, I was looking for something more along the lines of a growing small business. I think it's worth a look if you are in charge of large scale manufacturing."
2,Is there a software with this book?,I want to know about this book. Are there Jobshop Scheduling or Queing(assing n job for m machine for minimum idle time)and I finding the software about it.
3,Molding Picture Frame Hook,"The order arrived on time, but the hooks did not match and one of them was not properly formed. Disappointing."
2,Buy a normal backpack,"This is a cheap backpack. It has two big pouches with a divider in the larger of the two pouches. The changing pad that it comes with is disposible!Don't waste your time with this one. I would recommend either getting a normal backpack and a separate changing pad or using your wife's bag. It seems that a lot of the ""Daddy friendly"" diaper bags are just cheap bags with a pad."
4,Go tell it on the mountain,"I first heard this album over a year ago and have told everyone I know about it since then. At first listen it's a shocker, completely unexpected, lyrically complex and obtuse. But upon further listen, your ears start to peel away the layers and hear new sounds, new harmonies, buried lyrics in a soundscape of spacey, astrosurfy punky electro. ""Hummingbird Pneumonia"" would be a hit if radio formats weren't determined by a monopoly. Recommended if you like: Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Devo, Man or Astroman?"
5,Wow..simply animatastic as i should put it,"All i can say about this album is 4 words; LINKIN PARK IS ROCK!!they have dominated everyone in the rock busniess with ""In The End"" and the popular hit ""Crawling"" and seeing what I saw in their new :remix: album is fenominal....remixes of Pts Of Athrty and Krwling rele show what this group can do...im waiting to see what they have in store in their new album that should be out this decembergr8 gr8 albulm!!"
2,Peerless 70 Anos,"Unfortunately, all the Arcaraz tracks are badly distorted. It is too bad, as there are a lot of good titles that I would have loved to hear, but in this distorted offering, they are not worth hearing. The Ruiz tracks have much better sound, but they were not the ones I wanted. I was after the Arcaraz tracks.ednoble@totacc.com"
3,"Necessary for learning Lebanese dialect, but not on it's own.","This book and cd are necessary for learning the Lebanese dialect of Arabic. You will, however, need Pimsleur's ""Eastern Arabic I"" to learn the language. ""Arabic You Need"" is not adequate to really learn to speak Levantine Arabic. Pimsleur gives you the important stuff and their teaching method is excellent. The problem is that it is the Syrian dialect which is different from the Lebanese dialect. So if you get both you will be set.I hate to say this because this book really is necessary for learning the Lebanese dielect. This book and cd set really is not going to teach you Lebanese Arabic on it's own. The speakers go too fast on the cd and there is no repetition. You have to constantly start, stop, rewind and replay the cd."
2,Excellent Soundtrack and Must-Have For Gordy Lovers!,"One of the best, if not THE bests thing about Gordy is the country music. Excellent soundtrack themes by Charles Fox, and great country music, including Doug Stone, that is too fun to pass up. Includes the full versions of the Judd's ""Guardian Angel"" and Tag Team's (Whoomp! There It Is fame) rap number of ""Pig Power"", both of which have only clips featured in the movie. Also included the must-have line dance tune ""Your Heart's On the Line (Pullin' On A Pigtail) by Kristy Young. Read my review of Gordy the movie to get an complete overview on this great movie. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Bad Bet,"I took a gamble buying this book on positive feedback from others - I lost.Lots of ryhmes, many words in CAPITALS, even a picture of the author circa 1949 but unfortunately very little useful information on how to systematically implement winning sports betting methods."
5,Read the Library's Copy First,"I read this cover to cover from the copy I checked out from our local library and since I don't retain details anymore, so I wanted a book all my own. It is great for giving a wide variety of easy to do projects and I plan to try most of them, though I am waiting so I can ""bake"" outside, because I hate that smell in my house. I can't wait."
2,DISAPPOINTED AGAIN,"There must be a polymer clay book out there that is worth the money, but I haven't found one yet! This one is not quite as bad as ""Quick and Easy Gifts in Polymer Clay"", but its still up there in stupid.Here again is the ridulous clay covered pen, the clay decorated journal, or the clay decorated mirror, need I go on. Each item is also accompanied by a long list of things you need to go out and buy to complete it!I don't care how ""cute"" the book is, if the projects are useless and stupid, costly to make, what's the point?!I wasted my money and time!"
4,Another good one,"Another good assessment center preparation book.This has a lot of good information in it, and is a great tool for your promotional arsenal."
3,comfortable slip,"This slip is very soft and comfortable, quality is good. It seems to run large for it's size and is very full."
1,not pleased.,"this slip was too long, the description did not give the length. it was also too full for a half slip, it bunches up with any pencil or straight skirt."
1,What's with this price?,I love the original Dark Shadows and I've already purchased the first ten collations and plan on getting the eleventh soon. But who's going to pay over $227 for twelve episodes of a TV show when you can get entire seasons of most other shows on DVD for less then $50?
3,"Kimo is here to spread the word of the Lord - and fight, of course...","September 9, 1994Charlotte, NCThe UFC got progressively more professional with each event. UFC 3 - ""The American Dream"" was decent, but the main event was quite uninteresting, as an alternate had to step in for the final fight. The true talent suffered injuries in victory that prevented them from meeting in the finals (Defending 2-time champion Royce Gracie & shoot-fighter Ken Shamrock).We do, however, get our first look at Kimo Leopoldo. He is indeed a strange and eccentric character - and he gives Gracie his best fight in UFC competition to that point.Aside from this standout matchup, there is some decent action and some rather humorous characters. It took some fighters a while to realize that they weren't in the WWF and that they didn't need a gimmick in order to compete - but as I've said, the UFC was still growing and taking form.This DVD is worth owning for the history..."
2,Fernie's Anthology is an Odd Compilation,"The choices Fernie made in compiling his anthology often seem to make little sense. His Vasari excerpt, for example, is a mish-mosh of badly excerpted Lives and patched together methodology--not one complete, coherent excerpt. Further, as a scholarly tool, it is quite irritating that Fernie deletes the footnotes to all the texts save his own. In addition, his introductions to each piece are not very insightful nor are they stimulating. Unfortunately (and this is what saves the anthology from being a 1) it is the only introduction to various methodologies for the young art historian. For the interested amateur this is a good start (although note that there are many other interesting texts that are not included in the anthology--Pliny, for example). If I were a Professor, however, I would simply make a packet of materials for my students of more substantive excerpts WITH footnotes and without Fernie's summations."
2,Have I seen this before?,"From the beginning of this movie/series you can see Evangelion, it looks like a very clear duplication done poorly. There are many parts that compare to Tenchi Muyo as well but the similarities to Evangelion just never left my mind. Nothing particularly wrong with the title except the lack of any real action, just nothing to recomend it either.If you want another title to add to your collection you can do worse, but if your on a budget skip this and buy something else."
2,"It works, but . . .","In order to get it to Hotsync with my Clie 760c, I have to hold the hotsync cable tightly to the PDA, otherwise it won't connect, or will start to hotsync and then disconnect."
4,Annette's great BUT....Where is the DVD???,"I am giving this movie 4 stars because Annette Funicello is an amazing actress and I love all her movies. I would however like to express my deep disappointment that MGM chose not to release this movie on DVD as they did with all the other ""beach movies"" they released (Beach Party,Pajama Party, and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini). I hope that MGM will consider a DVD release of this movie so that we can all enjoy this film in the best possible sound and picture quality and also be able to choose between the widescreen and pana scan formats. I personally would rather watch a movie in widescreen format which is one of the main reasons I was disappointed in MGM not coming through on a DVD release. DVD offers quality,great extras,and the ultimate movie experience."
2,Very disappointing!,"The product arrived in a crumpled box - no big deal. However, it is stiff as a board - feels like it is made of some kind of plastic rather than rubber, and when I put hot water in it to test it, within a half hour, the water was cool. I bought this to replace my favorite hot water bottle that I've had for years. It's soft, pliable and so comforting on a cold night. This one wouldn't comfort anyone. I have no idea what kind of hot water bottles people have had who are giving this a great review. I bought it because of their reviews, so want to make sure other people don't make the same mistake. Furthermore, it's made in China. I'm going to scour the net for one made in Italy where my current hot water bottle is from. Save yourself the money and bypass this product unless you are looking for a brick."
2,50/50 Failure Rate,"I purchased two of these, one for each of my daughters. One still works fabulously well and we love it. The other one sprung a leak right away and had to be thrown away. It leaked from the spout - we tried putting the cap on tighter, more loosely, etc., but unfortunately it kept leaking. Because the girls were using these in bed, it just made it impractical to continue using."
1,Leaking problem,"I just purchased this item and tried it out. It leaks really bad. I tightened the top so tight that I felt the plastic was going to break and it still leaks. Perhaps I just got a defective unit, but I'm going to return it and pay a little more for a better quality brand that won't leak."
1,It Leaks. NO GOOD!!!,"I dont need to right a long review or anything like that. This item leaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaks,leaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaksleaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, leaks. Cant even use it."
2,Does not stay hot,"No matter how hot the water is, the water bottle does not feel hot or stay warm for very long.."
3,the cap broke after 2 months.,"Overall this water bag is very well made. Except that the plastic cap feels cheap and fragile...It finally broke after 2 months of regular use. I'd say it's worth the money($8 when I bought it, I would not pay more than that.) You just need to be extra careful when tightening the cap. :/"
2,Common Sense Health,"If you have been dealing with Lupus for a while you know that there are certain things you stay away from. But, if you have just been diagnosed with Lupus this might be a good book to start with as it is small and a quick read. Although 1/2 the book is only testimonies, there are a few good things. I would have liked to see more scientific proof of why the author says certain things were bad. Also, I thought she would cover the night shade plant family and she did not."
4,on my way,"After partially adhering to the lupus recovery diet, about 1/4 of my symptoms have gone away; My fevers are less frequent, the inflammation in my joints is going down, i am not as fatigued, and the bloating and stomach pains have dramatically decreased. Even my boyfriend has a lot less indigestion from eating the prepared meals.This partial recovery is encouraging and gives me hope. As I eat less of the off-limit foods that cause my immune system to overreact, I expect full recovery."
3,It's all about vegan,"Presents a good argument for adopting a vegan diet as an alternative for managing autoimmune system disorders. It may be worth a try in lieu of Prednisone, Plaqenil, Cellcept and every other drug my rheumatologist keeps prescribing."
5,REALLY worth a try for anyone with autoimmune disease,"As a physician, I look at all ""cures"" with skepticism. This is much more than ""stories"", although the stories are enlightening. Ms Harrington presents a very reasoned approach that has obviously worked well for her (You should see her dart around the tennis court after being grounded from most active pursuits for several years...and yes, all her auto-antibodies are gone, too. So this isn't a placebo!)It gives the reader lots of background, a cogent review of popular and scientific literature, and a personalized approach. Take from it what you will and what works for you. Even if you do not have any autoimmune problems, the recipes are great and the book is a practical guide to a healthy lifestyle. (+/- prolonges fasts)."
4,Vegan Wolf,"Mostly good information with a few improbable conclusions. After reading the book, I started following a strict vegan diet. It's been 2 weeks now, and there's been no miraculous cure, but some improvement. I'm eager to maintain this lifestyle. I've had lupus for over 30 years, and had figured out some of the diet solutions on my own, so a lot of the book makes sense to me. The book offers good information, and the included recipes are easy and tasty."
4,Not just for Luus!,"While I find this diet difficult to stick with, it is well worth the effort. It not only helped with the lupus, but several other health issues. I feel that this diet is healthful for most people. I would like a few more receipes, but was able to find those online."
5,"Great book for taking control of auto immune disorders like RA ,Lupus ,Diabetes",The author shows us how we can get back control of our own body by controlling what we eat.Going on a raw Veggies and Fruits and whole grain diet is the single most factor the author recommends andshe is backing this from real life survivors of auto immune disorders .How they suffered with the nasty side effects ofthe prescription drugs and how ultimately a Plant -Based diet provided them recovery.A great morale booster for a newly detected patient .A great guide for anyone suffering the side -effects of toxic medications .
2,Oily? Yes,"They should call this book GREASE FROM A MONASTERY GARDEN. The recipes use way too much oil to the point that they're not healthy for any living being. If this is the way monks eat no wonder there are so many fat monks. Take the recipe for Risotto della Certosina. Right away you see the ingredients that begin with ""Half a cup of olive oil (good quality)."" I don't care if it's good quality or not that's a lot for 4-6 servings--that's two tablespoons per person. The way this recipe (for mushrooms and rice) works you could have just used one tablespoon of olive oil and it would taste just as good.The author has a nice style however, and the illustrations are a dandy delight in pale shades of red, silly pictures of monks having fun and growing vegetables."
2,Hot sync cable does not work,"Like the other user, the hotsync cable does not work. Windows XP does not recognize my IPaq when connected with the hotsync cable, but no problem with the Compaq supplied cable. There is nothing to 'do wrong' as another reviewer suggests."
2,"A nice package for charging, but the data sync doesn't work","This package of tools could be one of the best, all-around charging and sync solutions, however I cannot get the data sync cable to work. Under both Windows Me and Windows 2000, the PC side fails to recognize the iPAQ device attached via the USB cable. In both operating environments, I have no problem using the Compaq supplied cradle, attached via USB.Worst of all, the Travel Kit comes with no instructions, no drivers or other software, and no references regarding how to get support from the manufacturer. Through some web searching, I believe that I have located the mfg., but the web site doesn't specifically offer any information about this item. I have sent emails hoping to get some answers, but, for now, this has been far more frustrating that it should be."
1,Sync doesn't work as expected,"Just the same as the other reviewers. The cable is fine for charging the iPaq batteries, but it won't sync on any PC. The package contains no manual or web address where to get support. Don't buy this product unless you only want it to recharge the battery."
1,busted,"The Crave website actually posts this note:POKER 2: Large Tournaments CrashThere is an issue on World Champion Poker 2 will the game will crash when trying to complete a tournament of 200 people and higher. Before you can finish any of these events, the game will crash.GREAT news to discover after working your way through hours of gameplay several times to near a final table. I would add that I have had tournaments of 30 people crash as well. I am outraged that they would not have had this tested before marketing and selling. I will NEVER buy a Crave game product again."
1,BUGGY SOFTWARE -- AVOID,This game has a consistent crash bug that makes large tournament play impossible ( crashes in mid-game with no way to complete these tournaments ). The Crave website even states that this bug exists -- why wasn't this game tested before I and many others spent our money on it? This is unacceptable and I will avoid all titles Crave puts out in the future.
2,Defective memory - poor quality control,"I needed 2 Gig of memory for my HP Pavilion. SO I thought the PNY Optima would be perfect. I ordered 2 one Gig modules, when I got them one worked and the other did not. When I was sent replacements I got the same deal one worked and one did not. I got the 2 Gigs I needed but it took four modules to get 2 good ones. That is poor quality control...."
3,don't know what went wrong,"i bought two of this modules for my old gateway desktop g series. after i plugged them in the pc recognized them on board, but the system don't seem to work with them. the modules that came with the pc have the same specs as ddr2 533mhz pc2-4200. don't know what was the problem."
1,Not the same as pictured!,"Not sure its even PNY optima since it didn't come in their package and dosen't say on the module. In addition, I don't see any difference on speed since I added these modules."
3,1 good 1 bad,received these in a timley fashion install easy but ha dboot up problems with computer after .did a week of troubleshooting with hit or miss results. frustrated let sit 1 month came back computer crashes aftyer 15 mins with fatal memory error finally tried one chip at a time found bad one now works great with that removed. now to see if I can get any warranty out of manufaturer we'll see.
5,"Worth Owning, Buy It.... -Jult Warfell","This was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay bettern the series and I liked the series despite the confusing and disapointing finish to that series. Own it, Collect it........ -Jult Warfell"
5,Evangelion 1.11 You Are Not Alone review,"Short and sweet review commence: Amazing addition to the old series, great quality perfect buy for any fan, worth it for the blu-ray! Other than that it was great service came first day and prefect condition 5 stars!"
3,plazo,"producto llega fuera de la fecha de recepción, renvalsaron gastos de envió por no recepción en el plazo estipulado empaque en buen estado"
5,Evangelion: 1.11 You Are Not Alone,it was different for the original most of the voice actors had changed they added new charterers the story line was chopped up like episode 3 was 2 and the 5 was 3all in all i liked it but the thing that annoyed me was the change the wording of most of the dialog
4,This movie is not bad.,"This movie is good but not all that good and didn't had that much action scenes. ""EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone"" on blu ray is a good addition to you collection/library. The story is solid (even though I had no idea what sense the story is trying to say, probably because I didn't watch the original series). The animation is far-by outstanding in High definition. But sometimes, I feel that the main character isn't that well developed until the end of movie. Overall: This is a movie that I recommend to any fan of the original series, Blu ray fan, or anime fan. thats why I'm giving ""EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone"" a B+. Can't wait for the next movie (which is going to be released next week) ""EVANGELION 2.22: You can (not) advance""! XD"
4,Excellent version but----,"I'm writying this as a old anime fan coming back onto the new anime scene:Having been a late-comer to this series, I've been blown away completely by it for 3 reasons- character background/design/synopsis- Mecha design/functionality- story backdrop/synopsisI've seen the compiled movie versions and have rented/borrowed the first original 10 episodes. The animation in this DVD (and v 2.22)is outstanding to say the least and performs perectly to carry on the story.But ---How many time s can one show and tell a story to an audience that knows the beginning and ending? It does cut some corners and loses some pacing but I'm not going to watch an successful cult series/movie be REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN like BLADE RUNNER!!! I will despite this, look forward to the next 2 feature films. Any further decimals or numbers added on, count me out! >:Panother gripe:The Extras DVD does NOT live up to anything worthwhile! I expected more >:("
5,Anime Classic Is New And Improved,"If you've never seen Evangelion before and you're wondering if you should watch it, you definitely should, and this is the release to get. If you're wondering if you should upgrade to this from previous releases, you need only know this is hands down better than all previous Evangelion releases! So much so, in fact, that this is worth the fee for the upgrade if you ""already have it"". As you can tell by the product description all the video (now 1080p) and audio (now Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both EN and JA) has been redone. The result with regards to that is not just everything looking and sounding better, but it also packing more of a punch every step of the way throughout. Another nice improvement here is that it is much more seamless than it was originally. The disks are running at about 100 minutes in length - and it isn't butchered into 20 minute episodes padded with superfluous openings and endings - instead it's presented in one fluid piece of anime goodness."
4,Solid but still the same,"It was a solid reworking of the original 6 (5?) episodes with just enough new/changed material to merit a viewing or a buy if you're a fan. There are just enough differences that there is space to change the plot and it makes a fan anxious to see the next entries, yet at the same time, no significant changes are present...yet. I look forward to seeing where the rest of the movies will take the series. The picture quality looked phenomenal to me but I'm not an avid bluray/HD viewer so it may not be that great (I honestly don't know). Worth a buy if you're a fan, especially if you can get it cheap."
4,First time Evangelion viewer,"I had never seen Evangelion, but had been hearing a lot about the recently released Evangelion 2.22 and wanted to check it out after reading more about the series online. My impression of Evangelion 1.11 is that it is mostly a setup for the future movies. It introduces us to some crucial characters and sets up the main premise of angels battling Evas in an already decimated world. (Do the angels only attack Japan though? ;) ) The movie has some good action and great animation. Most importantly it left me wanting to see the next installment in the series. As a stand alone movie, Evangelion 1.11 isn't a new favorite, but I have high hopes for the series as a whole and can't wait for Evangelion 2.22 to be delivered!"
5,Absolutely Crazy About This,"I have been a Neon Genesis Evangelion fan for the longest of time, since before it aired in the US on Adult Swim. I've been meaning to acquire this title since even before it was released. I was surprised to see how much it was for, nearly half the retail price in Japan. Package came in great condition, with the actual DVD and extras. Also came with some art work to gaze at.Worth it, if you like Anime in general, absolutely needed if you can't get enough of neon gensis evangelion. :3"
4,NIce video but not good for collection,"I like the video. But if you try to find something for long term collection, it is not what you want"
3,not worth 22.00,yes this movie is nice lookin but thats it. its short runtime nd lack of extras makes it a ripoff. its better to buy the platnum collection boxset.
2,"Pretty, but distorted","This was my first taste of ""anime"" and while the visuals are very nice the black lines mimicing lips were too unnatural to me. The story was too complicated and not entertaining at all."
1,this is a scam,"This is nothing more than a repackaging of Evangelion: 1.01 made to look like the next in the series. While this version is special edition of 1.01 and has features that 1.01 didn't. Every part of the dressing of this version is meant to imply that it is the next chapter.If special editions are your thing, then this is a good series to collect special editions of. They did a great job of remaking Evangelion, but that fact can be enjoyed by watching Evangelion 1.01 if you already have that version.This is just a warning because the dressing on this set is very deceptive."
5,EVA Remake,"The remake of 1.0 is worth it in that it has roughly 15mins of new footage and the image quality is rendered brighter (showing more detailed art; ie: dark shadow scenes are more clearer, brighter, and detailed than the 1.0). Overall, it's good and enjoyable movie."
5,Outstanding accuracy of dates & places,"I was part of the original crew aboard the Missouri from Commissioning Day, June 11, 1944 until March, 1946 as a Radioman in the CR Division. Paul Stillwell did an outstanding job of giving an accurate account of dates and places involving the USS Missouri from the first bolt installed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard until the present time. I use this book quite often to refresh my memory of the exact dates of various things that happened while I was aboard. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing an accurate history of the USS Missouri = BB63."
4,Mighty Book on the Mighty Mo,"This is a very large book. The text is great, the story is well told and informative. My only gripe is that the paper is cheap, and the pictures are not very clear. This would not have mattered so much had I not bought it to use for modelling reference."
3,More human interest and less mechanical info,"This was a fairly pricey book for me, but I had just bought a model kit of the ship and wanted to read about it and use the photos for detailing information. This book has a lot more human interest information and less about iron actual iron."
4,Eva Ibbotson's great books,"I read these books quite a long time ago, and they're still on my shelves. Eva Ibbotson made me laugh and at the same time I couldn't put the book down. These books are like Harry Potter- I read Harry Potter first, and when I was looking for something to read, I found these books. I bought all three of them and do not regret it.Perhaps it would be best to start with The Secrets of Platform 13- it was the one I liked best. Then if you find you like that style of books read Ibbotson, Funke, Rowling, Elizabeth Kay..."
2,Great carseat - for a few months,"I bought this carseat after reading all the great reviews. I've had it for 8 months, and never had a problem, until I noticed something the other day. The seams on both sides of cover (on either side of where the child sits) have completely ripped. I don't understand why. I have never left it outside and everytime we washed the cover we did it by hand. I am in the process of contacting the company to complain. I paid $130 for this carseat...I would expext more!"
3,BEST ED HARRIS FILM SINCE GLENGARY GLENROSS,"although this isnt the best western i've seen, it was good, i love ed harris in about everything. its worth watching"
3,Great up until the middle...,"I started out really liking this movie. I won't spoil it but dang... the middle (when they picked Renee back up) was a killer for me. From there on out, it just seemed to die and turn do something weird. Not a good weird either. My husband is a western man and loves them but he didn't really care for this movie either.I would suggest Unforgiven over this movie anyday. But then again, almost any of the Clint westerns are far better than this movie was."
4,Love that 8 guage shot gun,"Being raised on the Western/War genre in a family whose Dad didn't get to sleep without seeing one on TV, it was fun to see films like ""3:10 To Yuma"", and now ""Appaloosa.""I am a big fan of Viggo, and he again is connected to his role as if he WAS ""Hitch."" I have a problem with actors directing themself...its a quirk of mine, but Ed was good.The action is worthy of the ""oater"" label and there is relativly little offensive language which; in itself is a miracle. It is a fine film of fun and suspense, ""shoot 'em up!""It DID NOT end as I was assuming it would, which always makes me want to see it over and over. The BluRay is exquisite.My kids loved it too.Oh yes, a great film to see quality of attention to the period and re-creating it for the audience."
2,"Solid acting doesn't really save the sluggish, often boring story","First I am a fan of Harris, Mortensen, Zellweger, and even Irons. I am also a fan of westerns which have faded from the mainstream quite a bit. I was really excited about Appaloosa but after a watch I found myself personally very disatisfied. The acting is great, the scenery and setting are perfect, but the story! It is extremely sluggish and dry and often times confusing. I found myself often asking ""why are they doing this?"" and ""wait, what?"" There is a total of 1 major fight scene that lasts all of 20 seconds despite the films promise of ""Thunderous Action and Nail-Biting Suspense."" The majority of the movie seemed to center around Ed and Viggo sitting around drinking coffee talking to each other. Maybe I just need to watch it again but first impressions are everything and to be honest, mine wasn't a good one."
5,Good Western,I am a fan to all 3 main characters in this movie. Ed & Viggo are the good guys saving towns from bad guys like Jeremy. I've seen better westerns but for the value it was worth watching...looking at the men don't hurt either.
4,VIRGIL AND EVERETT MAKE A STAND,"This is an adaption of one of Robert Parker's wonderful westerns, and as such, has great interaction between the two protagonists, Virgil and Everett as they take on the wicked rancher and other miscreants. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons are believeable, Renee not so much. I enjoyed the film but wouldn't stack it up with Outlaw Josey Wales, or the Unforgiven, etc. However, good entertainment."
4,"A fun, modern Western.",I enjoyed the give and take between Ed Harris' and Vitto Mortensen's characters. They really cared for each other. The story showed the fine line that can exist between honor and cowardice.
1,shocked,"I love westerns ,I like Ed Harris ,I like Rene Zellweger.What happened.The rolling stone reviewer who thought it was thunderous with action and nail biting suspense,must have just gotten out of a coma and never saw a western in his life.this was an embarrassment to watch.I usually do not write comments about films but this was BAD."
3,Low-key buddy Western,"I wasn't in love with the script here as I paused this about half dozen times to get through it. The soundtrack is mixed very low and I had a hard time making out all the laconic dialogue between Ed Harris and Viggo. You've seen this show before, so don't expect much that is new. The sharp-shooter is an old cliche in Westerns, and this one is a bit cliched all the way through, from the buddies, to the loose woman to the various shootouts. An opportunity seemed wasted here to make this better than it is."
2,Disappointing...,"AppaloosaI wanted to view an exciting western, but found this to be very disappointing. The acting was okay, but I didn't like the plot."
2,Good Entertaining Western,"Appaloosa was a good Western movie. Ed Harris played a great role and I was throughly entertained throughout most of the film.I believe I expected a bit more, with todays technology in film making. There were some really slow areas where I almost lost interest.Was it as good at 3:10 to Yuma? No, not quite and I was not all that impressed with that movie either.Was it as good as Tombstone with Kirt Russell & Val Kilmer? Absolutely not, Tombstone is my all-time favorite Western."
1,Jeremy Irons as a Cowboy?,"I could not wrap my head around the fact that Jeremy Irons played a cowboy with a very bad western/southern/cowboy accent. I am sorry, but he just could not pull it off. He is too sophisticated and polished of a British actor to be playing a cowboy. Renee Zellweger was out of her element in this film. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen work well together. I can see them as a team. The story moves too slowly and it bored me to tears to be quite honest. For cowboy/western movie fans, this will definitely work. Sorry my review was not too favorable."
1,Appalooser!!!!!!!!!!,"This is possibly the worst movie ever made. For a group of such fine actors, this movie was undeveloped, unreal and painfully boring. Ed Harris is NOT director/producer material. Viggo Mortensen did a fair job with the awful script provided, but Rene Zellweger was terrible. She looked like someone had punched her until her face was swollen and bloated like a dead fish. The scripting was laughable throughout. ""I've known you a long time, long as you've known me"" Total crap. Save your money and time."
1,No good,I am a fan of Ed Harris and was really looking forward to his first film as a director. The film started off very interesting and exciting but slowly went downhill after that. The story is very simple and nothing about it is unique or very interesting. I am not a fan of Renee Zellweger and her performance in this movie reminded me why. The movie switches back and forth between action and romance. The action isn't bad but the characters often do things that make no sense at all. And the romance is very unbelievable and just seems like an excuse to move the plot along. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't find any reason to.
2,Review of Appaloosa,"I liked the movie, but the sound fades in a lot of places in the movie while the actors are talking. Hard to understand what they are saying. I just ordered the movie. I watched movie twice. I would like to return it for another copy."
4,Very good solid western,"This was a very good, solid western. Good cast of characters, good acting, multiple story lines within the movie, but not hard to follow. Very believable... It had it all... the good guys, the bad guys, Native American Indians and, of course, the girl. I really enjoyed it and would really recommend it if you like westerns. Good job Ed Harris!"
1,waste of time,"This was a terrible movie. The story was slow and the plot was boring. I kept waiting for something to happen, and then when it did, it was uneventful and kinda stupid. My husband loves westerns and he hated it."
1,Terrible Western,"I don't normally do this but hopefully it will save someone some time and money.In my humble opinion this is one of the most disappointing westerns I have ever seen. The first time you hear a gun shot, you will know the quality of the whole movie. It sounds like cap guns going off. The story would be fine if it wasn't for the acting. I don't mean the actors, just their performances. It is way below what they are capable of. If this is Ed Harris' first shot at directing, he should stick to his acting. After all the great movies these actors have performed in, this one should never have been released. I gave my DVD away right after watching it. What a waste of money."
1,"Horrible,","while it looked awesome in previews, the film did not at any part live up to my expectations. I found the dialogue dry and boring. The actors chemistry was poor, God knows viggo tried. The plot was horribly predictable and action scenes few and far between. I wouldnt even advise renting it."
2,appaloosa,I just didn't think this was a great movie. The acting was so terrible and choppy. Terribly boring!
1,LIKE WATCHING CARDBOARD MOVE,"Terrible, just terrible. I don't think friends should make movies together. It is too self-indulgent. Viggo Mortensen was his usual cardboard character (does anyone see a difference between this character and Tom Stall from ""A History of Violence""?). No emotion in his voice. A one-note intonation. And eerily enough, Ed Harris also seemed to have channeled his ""A History of Violence"" cardboard character as well. Renee was pretty good. She at least seemed animated and kept you from falling off your chair while you fell into a coma just trying to stay wake watching this western. And for the life of me, I don't understand why they used that flat-chested woman who looked like a boy as the saloon prostitute. In the real old west, the prostitutes were very well endowed and much, much heavier. Jeremy Irons as the villian was okay.In short, boring film, cardboard characters (except for Renee)and just some self-indulgent friends making a movie. Save your money."
2,Why did they bother?,"As Samuel Johnson apparently never said, the original parts of Appaloosa are not good and the good parts are not original. There are fragments of the script that could have been expanded into effective movies on their own by real directors like Mann or Boetticher, but under Harris' direction, it just ambles along in a unenjoyably distracted fashion without bringing anything new to the western genre. The DVD extras consist of deleted scenes (which somehow must have been even worse than what they left in) and the usual the-making-of propaganda shorts that explain what a great movie it is. Wait to check this one out of the public library unless you want to help fight the recession by foolishly paying twenty dollars for it like I did at the local big box store."
3,Not quite an epic but worth watching,"The one movie genre we make well in America is the Western and as a fan of Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen I had high hopes for Appaloosa.Disappointed is not the right word for how I felt after watching it but somehow the movie didn't quite achieve what other modern Westerns like Wyatt Earp achieved. It was well acted, well shot, the pace was sometimes a little slow but a Western has to somehow be an 'epic' to work: like The Good The Bad and The Ugly. So maybe it just wasn't ambitious enough. Worth watching though."
3,"It is all good, except the script","Fine acting, great camerawork, senic locations, period correct clothing and weapons - it is a pity that the script veered off into wonderland at about the halfway point. It would be bad enough for the hero to trade the bad guy for his kidnapped girlfriend when he could have gotten her back by gunfire, but to let the bad guy go without getting her back was insane. This was followed by the bad guy heading for mexico rather than back to his ranch and his 20 loyal henchmen."
2,Don't waste your time,Nearly a complete waste of time. This is a 15 minute story drug out for nearly two hours.
4,"Good Movie, Not Viggo Mortensen's best...Try A History of Violence","Appaloosa is a familiar story told well enough that it's worth seeing, but won't truly linger for any but the most diehard Western fanatic.Appaloosa is an archetypal western with touches of the modern buddy comedy. Though it falls short of these classics, it is a little bit Destry Rides Again and a little bit more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
5,I don't care for Westerns as a rule...,"but I loved this movie. There isn't a dull moment. My son recommended this movie to me, and I am glad he did. What a thrilling way to wile away an hour or two on a dull afternoon."
2,Much to be desired,"With the cast involved, the story line made more sense being done by one of Clint Eastwood's characters. Ed Harris is too fine an actor for this venue."
2,Appaloosa,"The movie was ok, but not what I expected. I really enjoy western movies and was expecting a true western. This missed the mark, but did have some good parts. I'll give it to someone, it's not one that I'll keep my for video collection."
4,A good western except for the language,"If the language hadn't been so course, I would have love this western. It contained everything else you would want in a good western - good actors, scenery, plot, and (of course) the good guys win."
2,"Love westerns, just not this one........","This movie has a good cast, at least on paper. What it doesn't have is chemistry.The romance between Ed Harris and Renee Zelwegger seemed contrived and they are not well-matched for this film. There is absolutely no spark at all between them.That's not to say that this is a bad movie, it's not. It just could have been a lot better.If you want to see a good western, check out ""Lonesome Dove"" instead."
2,Real time west,"Story was a-typical western, power over honor, rich over poor (real world rules). Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are great actors and do a great job in this movie. The story seemed to drag at times and Renee Zellweger really was a useless character (great actress but character not needed in this story), could have been a horse. Not up to Lonesome Dove, Silverado, or 3:10 to Yuma, but the actors make it worth it."
3,"Western with American, British and Australian cast","Ed Harris delivers his second movie with a cast of impressive group that includes Jeremy Irons, Viggo Mortensen and Renee Zellweger. Set in the wild west, small town of Appaloosa hires two professional gunhandlers to protect town from a group of thugs. Town can be prosperous since they have train delivering goods, but local business people need order to be brought in.As usual markation of territory begins, we learn that two gun handlers, newly declaired town sheriffs are long standing devoted friends to each other. They take care of each other and look each other's back. But as pretty widow comes into town, is their friendship going to sustain itself? Widow is making a fast moves on one of them and one keeps wondering what is the rush and what are her motives?It is a nice adventure cowboy film, but seems to loose focus on too many occasions."
2,Not good....Spoilers,"This was a big disappointment. The characters actions in this film border on idiotic. Ed Harris is supposed to be a tough gun-for-hire who has only been with prostitutes and a squaw, yet he ends up buying a house for Renee Z within hours of meeting her? Mrs. Zellwegger seems to have had a frightening amount of plastic surgery for any role, let alone a western. Viggo is the most likable character, but he is also dragged down by the horrific script. There were some good lines, hinting that maybe the book was far better.I like westerns and I almost turned this off several times.And why is there a picture of a marlin fighting on a big game rig on the wall of the sheriffs' office in 1800's New Mexico?"
2,I Love Westerns,"Hollywood has really lost touch with the Western genre in recent years. I believe Ed Harris made a sincere attempt of recreating a Western in the classic vein but the results are very disappointing. Apparently, I'm in a minority among other reviewers here but as much as I had great expectations for this film, it really fell flat. The great cast doesn't jell well together and the script was either poorly adapted from the Robert Parker novel or possibly the direction of Mr. Harris simply wasn't up to the task. Very disappointing."
3,Western?,Appaloosa is a modern film trying to be a western.It is not very memeroable at all.I tried to like it but just couldn't.
3,Picture quality is very bad,I started watching this movie last night. The dvd quality is not good. Its smeary and color is off.
2,Appalousa,"It was a little above average, but it seemed a little ""flat"" and had I known beforehand I would have recommended renting rather than buying. It seemed a waste of time for some very good acting talent."
2,Bad movie with good gunfight scenes,"This movie was a disappointment. Ed Harris was not a very good cowboy which was a surprise to me because I usually like his work. Maybe it was his lack of tough guy facial hair or maybe my real problem came down to the character he was playing who had a weakness when it came to women which made him seem weak overall. Viggo did well in his role, but I think both actors were hampered by the story which was a poorly recycled version of High Plains Drifter. Renee Zelweeger was also very annoying. On a positive note, Appaloosa did have realistic gunfight scenes that reminded me of ""Open Range."""
5,Appaloosa,"This movie is a family favorite at our house, and, is watched at least twice a month.The purchase was fast and efficient, as always, and we experienced no problems whatsoever."
1,THIS COULD'VE BEEN GOOD!!!,"The problem with this movie was quite simply- YOU SHOULD'VE HAD A DIRECTOR!.This cast would have worked... If it had another director. I love many westerns, like ""The Proposition"", ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", and ""Once upon a time in the West"" etc.. And I love Vito and Ed. But this was more like a couple of buddies trying to make a movie together, and it came out really immature and boring. The character flaws were just pathetically high....Sorry guys, 3 strikes. I really didn't care about who lived or died.I'm sure it will appeal to people who think that ""Smokey and the Bandit"" was celluloid magic."
2,APPALLOSER,"OH MY DEAREST ED!!! I luv ya BUT.... pahleeze stick to ur day job sweets...this film was paced with such formidable sinkholes in addition to plot disconnects and Viggo, aka Doc Holiday LOL, and Renee who just wants all those gorgeous men, YIKEs, at least seduce the stable lad...I trailblazed a path by actually watching this entire film with highest hopes in mind...sigh....how the West was won me wonders....wish I could have earned a eagle scout badge or sumpin...yowza"
5,Appaloosa,"As always, Amazon shipped the product quickly and in very good condition. The DVD was bought to replace one I borrowed from friend and misplaced. Thanks, Amazon, for keeping this friendship alive!"
2,Tiring western,"I like westerns, and wish the studios made more. But not like this one. I hope this western format is never copied even on TV. This movie drags, much too long and ruins opportunities for meaningful action scenes. I wasted 20 bucks. By the way, badly writtened."
1,Worst Western Ever!!,Appaloosa is by far the worst western movie I have ever seen. The movie made absolutely no sense at all!! Wait for the price to get down to about 4-5 dollars before buying this one!
5,Played it so much we wore the tape out,I bought this movie in of all places the Dollar Store for my grandchildren over 10 years ago. I figured for a dollar it was worth the investment. This movie has been seen so many times over the years that the tape on it finally just wore out. I was so happy to be able find this so I could replace it. There is nothing about this movie that I don't like and would recommend it to anyone.
1,Utterly unwatchable!!!,"Ok, maybe I just dont get it.... Seriously though, this movie was like watching a freak show of braying jackasses and rediculous fake blood. This movie obviously was meant to be random and weird, I just wasn't able to even finish this movie. I want a refund and an apology from the writer of this movie for wasting a half hour of my life watching this crap."
5,true to the description,"I got this lamp and it looked just like the picture showed. I installed it beside my bed so I can use it to read before bed. It has good quality and looks perfect on my white wall. Also, the price is reasonable and affordable."
1,These couldn't survive shipping,I didn't even get a chance to put these on my bike. The plastic buttons were cracked when received; even on a second replacement shipment. Returned all of them. I can't see these holding up on a bike.
4,A Sold Murder Mystery Series,"A continuation of the solid mystery television show of Jessica Fletcher and her unique ability always to find herself in the midst of some murder. With her wits and luck, she solves mystery after mystery. Each show is a pleasant adventure into the world of crime/detective."
4,love love love,Jessica Fletcher does it again!!!!! i could not pass this up. Ihave to own every season. I love Jessica Fletcher. She is sassy and not afraid of anyone.
4,"MURDER SHE WROTE, NINTH SEASON","I enjoyed all the season (1-8) so far, but for some reason this one was not interesting to me like the others."
2,Miss Marple with more glamour,"Why do people always joke that they'd never invite Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury, coasting like a pro) for a visit? Murders will happen and who better than Jessica to make certain that the right person is punished? Plus, she's always polite, well-dressed and generally great fun to have around. Unless of course you're the murderer. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
1,DV9000,HiWhole dv9000 series is in trouble and are being recalled. Type dv9000 recall in google and see the results.
1,Worked for a year,"I bought this laptop in November 2008. It was great for a year. A week ago, the NVidia graphics card was shot. The card wired into the motherboard. To replace it, you do for $800. To do it on your own, you buy the motherboard for $400. I do not think that this laptop worth anything.Also, this same problem happened to one of my teammates."
1,Do not buy HP products - very poor customer service,"Do not buy this product because no matter how much you like this product you will eventually have to call customer service. You will have to speak to someone (several people) from India who will not be able to help you. They don't care to help you, they will tell you anything to get rid of you. I spent six hours on the phone in the last two days and spoke to seven different people until I could finally speak to a supervisor. They have no problem lying to you and every person I spoke to had a different story as to why they couldn't (or wouldn't) help me. Make sure that you keep every bit of information that comes with your product and the dates that you purchased it or ordered parts or batteries for it. They say that you have a one year warranty but if you do not have all of your paperwork they will try to void your warranty even though they have records of everything. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED WITH HP!!"
1,Great Design- Horrible Service - HP Lost the Computer! Claims no Responsibility,"Amazon is a great company and have many great buys on line here, however HP Buyer's please be wary. If you never have a problem with your computer, you will likely be happy. However if you send it in for service, you may be in big trouble. I sent mine in for a broken battery latch. This, by the way, was extremely weak for the task of holding the battery in the housing. However, the worst part is that I shipped it to HP under warranty. HP service is now claiming that they shipped it back to me, however they can not give me a valid tracking number. They say I should take my troubles to Fed/Ex. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am out the cost of the computer as far as I can tell and HP is claiming no responsibility. HP LOST the computer."
5,great computer,"great computer !!!!! great screen, fast working, nice style, great design....the bad thing for me (and its the same for ever HP model of this kind) is that the lock string attaches to a little hole in the screen panel, and if someday you, or someone pull's the computer with the lock attached, it will sufer damage ....."
3,Wear gloves when using it!,"A great notebookPros: Has a nnumber key right on the notebookstays relatively cool when on the lapwebcam built right infit for vista and lightscribecons:the touch pad makes your fingers stick to itEVERY SINGLE PART PICKS UP FINGER PRINTS AND OIL FROM THE SKIN.The computer top, the cover, is made of a cheap black plastic that looks great when you take it out of the box, but two days later looks digusting.The lid doesn't lock into a tight fix and woubles.heavy, it is like 8 pounds"
2,Too sweet!,"I thought this would have a mild honey flavor, with a hint of chokecherry taste. The taste wasn't mild at all. The honey was much too sweet, and the chokecherry too strong, for my taste."
2,Flawed design,"This product seems to have one major design flaw. Instead of having the douche or enema pipe as one solid piece that inserts into the tubing, there is a single pipe adapter that is placed onto the end of the tubing. This is where pipes are screwed into. The threads on the pipes fit loosely into the adapter. Since there are only a couple of threads, there is really no way to over tighten the pipe to get it to stay on better. It seems the slightest water pressure is enough to loosen the connection. This is very annoying to say the least. I ended up replacing this unit with one that did not use an adapter."
2,So-so product,"Its great for what it does. But, I have purchased a few of these and, each time, the seal breaks and starts leaking where the hose connects to the bag.You can get some use, but not much. You get what you pay for..."
1,Great Value!,"This turned out better than I expected, because I can use it as a hot or cold water bottle too! I'm thinking of getting a few more for gifts!"
1,Redic,"I bought this brand based on the look and name and this thing leaks, leaks, leaks. DONOT NOT NOT buy this brand. No I have to go shop for another."
4,Practicality and Functionality a+,"I found this product to be effective and easy to use. It is rather simply made, but the materials seem durable and long lasting. The only fault I found with this product was that the hose just goes over the nozzle, and will come loose with a good tug. It doesn't leak though. All in all it works great!"
4,unnecessary but useful,"As an accessory to a HItachi drill/driver, these bits expand the range of usage and most importantly include an attachment for quick changing bits and another for starting a screw. Both are very useful."
5,Driving set,"Pretty cool little set, especially for the price. Comes with a bunch of bits of varying lengths, as well as a screw guide and a quick-change bit.I really like the case. It closes together securely into a compact package, and feels like it can handle being thrown around, etc. I also like that the bit folders swivel out for easy access. If you've ever had just a bunch of bits in a drawer or something, you'll appreciate how this makes it easier to stay organized."
5,"Good set, decent steel","I keep this set with my cordless drill and have been using it for about 2 years. It gets frequent, non-pro use, probably several times per week. I've worn out the square drive and a couple of the phillips bits, but they're easily replaced. I like having the long bits and usually reach for them first, especially when driving pocket screws.The case could be a bit better designed. When you rotate the bit carriers forward to take a bit out, one or more of the other bits tends to get dislodged, and you have to put them back into place to rotate the carrier back in again. Other than that, no complaints. This is a decent quality set with a good selection of bits."
5,Better than the original one,I had to replace the one I bought that came with the laptop. This one is much better and came at a reasonable price too!
2,relapse prevention book,"I have done counseling for 15 years. I thought this book was rather bland, a generic volumn of works that are more specific to the topic."
4,Can do much better,"This c.d of original recordings is a good group of tracks.But you CAN do much better then this c.d., for not much money.Shannon had 17 charted songs from 1961 to 1966, and then one in 1981.This c.d. is not very impressive with only 10 tracks.He also has some VERY good album cuts that are as good as his hits are.My personel favorite Shannon c.d. is ""The very best of Del Shannon Runaway"" on 'Collectables' label.With 30 tracks it's good from start to finish!"
1,DICK Armey's propaganda,"If you're interested in a pro-ENRON crony like Armey, then this book is for you. If you want to give up your safety net and what's left in benefits and instead want to allow the corporate barrons to mug you which DICK armey is in favor of, then read his fascist book and drown yourself in poverty !"
1,Let's Ruin America As We Know It,"Propaganda on how to dismantle our society, get rid of worker protections, get rid of safety nets, let illegal Maxicans on social security (which this Bush adminsitration has already done), ship jobs overseas and merge our society into a one-world government as recommended by Papa Bush during the 1991 war! By the way, do away with abortion so we can further overcrowd ourselves and live in a third world poverty struck country like India. Let's not forget NAFTA/GATT and what Papa Bush calls ""The New World Order."" By the way, let's further open our borders to more third world immigrants legal and illegal."
2,"Conservative myth with dishonest use of statistics,","Armey is too smart to consider this anything more than dishonest use of statistics of wealth and disguised ""supply side"" theory as ideological statement disguised as economics. Useful as charicature to understand positions taken but needs a critical reading and perhaps reference to Statistical Abstract of US. Ideology not Economics."
4,A small slice of good country music,"Better known for his days in front of the TV cameras as host of his own show, which itself is now more often recalled as the starting point of Dolly Parton's career, Porter Wagoner is one of the less-recognized remaining real old-time country talents. This CD, a collection of his most well-known hits, gives the unacquainted listener a pleasant introduction to the skills of this classic country singer. It also allows those who've heard them before, but probably not lately, the opportunity to revisit pleasant memories."
2,"This should be ""Second Best Songs"".","The songs on this selection are good (as all of Porter's songs are!), but they're not his BEST songs. ""Satisfied Mind"" is definitely the best song on the whole album."
3,my Marmot needs Viagra,"My Marmot needs Viagra.I love marmot gear, but sometimes you've gotta face it.I moved to the precip hat (full brim version) from a fabric one because I wanted the rain protection, and I got it. What I didn't get was a hat that could withstand wind. any wind. at all.The brim of the hat has nothing to either weigh it down or stiffen it, so when the wind blows your sun/rain protection disappears- the brim folds back against your head and no longer offers protection. I've resorted to buying a lightweight chain from the hardware store and putting inside the brim all the way around. It adds weight and is annoying to cut a hole in a brand new hat, but I couldn't find any other way to keep it up.."
1,Stupid game! Dont buy,This was one of the dumbest games i ever played. I somewhat watched the show as a kid and thought the game would be interesting. But i was wrong this game was terrible! Im regret even looking at it. The gameplay and controlls were terrible and sloppy. I was able to switch the characters once and i couldnt figure out how to do it again. I did also managed to stack up all of the characters to reach higher places. Then again i couldnt figure out how to do it again. It only tells you how to jump scare and throw stuff. Maybe its just me because i saw good reviews about this game. But i think this game was really dumb.
1,Deceptive advertising,"Your add offered two types of Shick injector blades: the ordinary kind which do not last as long, and are not as smooth in operation, and the Chromium Plus variety, which are excellent and a true treasure when they are available. I ordered the Chromium Plus blades and received the ordinary ones. I wrote to complain using the designated e-mail address, and I have yet to hear one word from your company in response to that complaint. Since injector blades of any kind are difficult to find, I will keep these, and when I must, use them, but I will be on the lookout for Chromium Plus blades from a more reliable vendor."
5,larry is pleased,"My friend was unable to secure blades for the razor he had used for years.I searched amazon, found his blades and made him very happy.\He had never used chromium blades, but found them superior to his old blades.Thank you Amazon.w0rgs@embarqmail.com"
4,comfy,Pretty comfy shoes - nice height. They do run 1/2 size small though. I am ALWAYS a 7 and had to exchange these for a 7 1/2 - so order a 1/2 size up or you'll need to exchange them.
5,Our copy is worn out!,"I've played this CD so many times over the years of raising 3 kids. Although the kids are very different, they all loved this CD. I don't know what I'd do without it! I wish it was still available. It used to be my standard baby shower gift."
3,For Dion completists only.,"A sloppy, but entertaining bootleg quality release.Half live in front of a small audience, the other half acoustic demos.All supposedly date from 1972, but on this thing, who knows for sure!Eighteen tracks total (regardless of what the cover says),with some song titles mis-identified.Sound quality ranges from good to fair. (Often during the same song!)The demo performances (mostly ad-libbed blues tunes) outshine thelive tracks in which Dion often sounds like he's on automatic pilot.Dion sounds inspired on the demos and it's quite fascinating to hearhis stream-of-conciousness blues. (Think every blues song thrown intoa blender!)The verdict: worth getting if you're a rabid Dion fan."
2,You get what you pay for,"The price of this product makes it very appealing especially since it's only a fraction of what you'd pay for if you bought the Palm branded ones. However there is a catch. The connection is very loose and I've gotten my Tungsten to sync about 1/10 of the time. I'm now even very hesitant to use it primarily as a charger because I'm wondering if the current is even constant enough to not do any damage to my palm's battery. Well, if these things don't bother you, it's still a cheap and affordable product..."
5,Bust-A-Move Rocks,"This is a awsome game. Like no other. All the bust a moves are great. I'm always playing them. Just to let parents know, this game keeps kids busy for hours. Well, any way this is my all time favorite GameBoy game."
4,Bubble Blast,Bust-A-Move is the best game for your Game Boy. YOu need to play in the light or you can't see the different colored bubbles. You can play against your friend(s) or the computer. You can get secret players after you win a certain amount of wins in a row.
1,just awful,"Richard Fawkes' writing is stilted, his phrases repetitive, and he doesn't convince me at all that he knows anything about the military. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Avoid like the plague,"Rambling incoherant plotlines, cardboard cutout characters, and highly tedious prose made this the second worst book I ever attempted to read."
4,Complex military sci-fi with a few extras,"The first 150 pages of this novel are overly complex, but don't let that deter you from reading on. The storylines finally do intersect and begin to weave together with varying rates of success. The socio-anthopological complexity that is inherent in both the human and alien cultures is strange and sometimes hard to understand, but the overall concept is fascinating, if disgusting at how mankind can be so ""in-human.""There are a number of mysteries generated that are not resolved until the last few pages, and there are several storylines that go unresolved making you wonder if a sequel is pending. The writing is solid, the characters well defined (if somewhat unlikable), and the pace/action moves along briskly. Recommended for those who enjoy reading a bit of military sci-fi mixed with a bit of hardcore and sociological sci-fi."
3,Intresting but slow,This book was interesting but there wasnt enough action in it keep me from putting it down. It ends leaving the reader no closer to the answer of the question it posed at the begining of the book (Who is the Remor and why are they bent on distroying humans?). This means that you have to read the next book in the series. I rather have the writer come up with more interesting plots than a series of books still trying to answer one question.
5,A dream over the clouds.,"It's one of the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful post rock album I've ever listenedto in all my life."
5,Beautiful Soup Bowls,"I had bought 8 of these soup bowls at Tuesday Morning thinking I was buying Queens China Thanksgiving. It turns out that they are Churchill and both companies have the same set, with just the stamp on the back being different. They are beautiful! Thank you!Churchill China Thanksgiving Turkey Multi Colors Rimmed Soup Bowls, Set of 4"
3,"Oneida Birch 20-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 4","Well, what do you expect for the price? They look nice at first, wash OK in the dishwasher, but break easily and half the set was gone in just a few months. Still, I think this was a good purchase given the price. Everything that's not ""made in china"" is way too expensive for my pocket."
5,One of the greatest guitar player around,Nick is not only one of the greatest guitar players I have ever heard he is also one of the nicest people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. He has mentored numerous kids and inspired even more. His new cd is awsome. I can't wait for the next one. Keep up the great work!!! Matt & Nico
5,Don't Miss Colionne's New CD !!,"Nick Colionne's just released CD ""Just Come On In"" is just fabulous. This is his best work yet and is sure to result in more national attention for this upcoming Smooth Jazz Superstar Guitarist. Check it out - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Great replacement,Aluminum dough hook arrived quickly and in good order. Fit Kitchen Aid Model K5SSWW perfectly. No more white chips in the dough from the original white dough hook. So happy this item was available online with no hassles.
1,sent wrong product twice,Sent me the coated Kitchenaid hook instead of the aluminum twice finally just ended up refunding it. would not recommend
3,"great overall concept, but...","We loved the idea that we could get a game for our kids that focused on the Bible. We thought most of it was going to be facts and maybe game show type style ways of teaching. However, that was only half true. Most of the games were centered on how fast you could do a certain challenge, not answer questions. Also, on one of the games if you choose the wrong item in a list, when it flipped around it was a ""devil"" looking guy with a wicked laugh. The kids didn't like that at all.We kept it for a little while but ended up throwing it away. There were some parts where they actually taught you things, but then there were the other parts that we just felt like it was a little too compromising.Hope this review helped you out!"
3,"Good but a little dated, mushy.","Most of these essays appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. They were iconoclastic for their time, but -- perhaps because they had an impact -- seem somewhat dated today, after Seattle 1999, 9/11/01, etc. Perhaps that's an unfair critique; a newer edition might include new introductory and concluding chapters that situate these papers more in the historical context.Analytics are not the strength of these essays, they would not pass muster in the AER or JLEO; their strength is in raising points of view omitted elsewhere. Some people don't find that useful, and admittedly some of the essays are too wordy -- could be cut in half or more -- but if you enjoy iconoclastic thinking you'll enjoy these."
4,No pain in the neck,"The heating pad worked fine. Since burns are related to the temperature and the duration of exposure, contemporary pads are not as hot as the one Grandma used (and are less likely to lead to a personal injury lawsuit). So adjust your expectations a bit and you'll be more satisfied."
1,Defective control,The Chinese manufactured control is defective and causes product failure within a month.
4,"Thanks, Richard!","I must have started this book 8 times before I finally finished it. Each time I'd start I'd become so interested in writing, I'd have to put the book down and grab some paper. His writing as served as a triggering town for me that seems very familiar and friendly. Only half the book ""teaches you to teach yourself how to write"" -- the rest offers tidbits about writing, or tells stories about his time in World War II as a professional writer. Good stuff if you're interested in the art of the written word!"
4,"Nice Seat, love Britax, but need advice","We just got the Marathon Olivia for our Honda CRV. I like it, and had a hard time between this, the Decathlon and the Roundabout. Our almost six year old has a Roundabout and still loves it, although we will be moving him to a booster shortly. The Marathon has the velcro to hold the side straps out to ease putting in baby, but what about the crotch strap? This and the belly pad always get in the way, and I think Britax should do the same holder with that. Did anyone else have this problem? Also, baby kind of slouches in it, and although it's tilted back (rear facing), she still seems to be a little too far forward. Anyone else out there with a CRV that solved these issues?"
5,AMAZING!,"I love this seat so much I wish I could ride around in it myself. Installation was simple and it is wonderfully secure. The seat is soft and plush but stays cool in hot weather (BIG plus!). One of my favorite little features is the velcro on the sides that allow you to anchor the straps out of the way while you get the baby positioned inside. Ingenius. Also, it came out of the box FULLY ASSEMBLED!!! After months of putting together baby gear this was a welcome relief. I chose the seat based on the strength of it's safety features and the high recommendations it received when I did my research and I have to say it lived up to my expectations. Well worth every penny."
1,BORING!,There are about 3 fish in the lake and they never do anything. You just sit there and waste batteries! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
4,More history in the making!,"The release of these classic events has been an incredibly exciting thing to me (since I have been a fan of this sport since it was in its earliest stages). These events have been faithfully reproduced from start to finish... all between fights commentating has been left intact so it retains the same feel as if you were actually watching the pay per view event for the first time.Honestly, if you are a fan of the sport you owe it to yourself to pick this DVD up along with the first three UFC classics. This is history in the making... and for only a few dollars you can have a slice of it!"
3,Would have liked a longer more in depth series,Joyce Meyer is such a great speaker. This is a topic that hits close to home with me. I'm seriously overweight and trying to change that. This was too brief of a teaching to get much out of it. I'd like to hear her talk about each reason in greater length with suggestions on how to improve things.
5,The best book,"This is an excellent book to learn fundamentals of linear programming and its applications. It's easy to read and it has a great set of of problems, after solving which you'll definitely say that you know something. Among the advantages of the book, I can highlight a great amount of examples, which are easy to follow and very helpful.There are several minuses of the book. I find it a little wordy, although as I said earlier the writing is very good. Also, the authors try to include as much material as possible, which makes some parts a little superficial. On the other hand the broadness gives the reader a good overview of the field.Overall, it's a great book for both studies and references."
5,Par Excellence!,"This book is THE best LP book I have come across. The topics are very clear and presented in the best possible manner. Introduces you to several basic and advanced LP topics, theorems and algorithms. The exercises at the end of each chapter test the students' understanding in an appropriate manner. A good number of examples are given to explain the theory in a better way. I would definitely recommend this book to a student interested in learning about optimization procedures and/or algorithm development.Surely helps if you have taken a linear algebra course before. Some students who haven't had a linear algebra course find the math nomenclature formidable in the beginning."
5,Thomas E Seeley,"I found this book easier to read than most linear optimization books. In particular, I think they do a good job of explaining duality."
3,Too Verbose,"Most part can be expressed in a more terse way and with math language. However, the book revolve around using very lengthy sentence to explain, which is not so helpful and clear as expressed with math. It can be condensed to half thickness."
5,Claypool Live!,"If you love the CD as much as I do and live in San Francisco, visit his new BBQ restaurant Claypool's (Steiner/Chestnut) on Thursday night for some great food and live music!"
2,Does NOT fit a 1993 Geo Tracker rear door!!!,"Amazon says it will fit 1993-1997 geo tracker rear doors (hard top) but after trying for about 30 mins to get them on they will NOT FIT the ball joint! Also, they are about 4 inches too long. Even if I got them connected, there was absolutely no way to get the other half connected as the door does not expand that far.Completely unhappy about this.Other then that they appear to be solid and very light weight... reason why i left two stars.return and refund!BOTTOM LINE: will not fit 1993 hard top geo trackers."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This CD was annoying. I know I am a grumpy pregnant woman, but still... I coult tolerate a 24 hour Barney marathon better than I can handle this. The performers use voices that belong on a program aimed at toddlers. You know, those sing-song voices some adults use when they are talking to young children, like they aren't people. Your better off listening to the radio or finding a good sitcom on TV. Don't waste your valuable energy placing this in the CD player."
4,Loved it!!,I bought tape with my second pregnancy and loved it..very funny and captures the lighter side of pregnancy.
3,Left-overs,"This book sat in a refrigerator for 30 years before being published. Unfortunately, I can see why. Although, some of the author's ""conversations among characters"" were good, a lot of it was trivial, regardless of the time period in which it was written. Although I was young in the 70s, I have a hard time remembering women's lib in quite the way it was written here.But, I guess the biggest disappointment for me was that I never felt that anything was ever brought to final closure. That last chapter ""Pete,"" in particular. was very unsatisfying.Had it been published in the 70s, it may have been a bigger success, but again, this was a rather disappointing read."
4,Topper,"For those who have been around the block a few times, like myself, the movies were a nostalgic high. Cary Grant not at his best, but still interesting and entertaining."
3,Love the Topper Films,"I love the topper films, but if I'm being honest - I was not impressed with this so-called ""Enhanced Double Feature."" There really isn't anything enhanced about the quality of the film. I would wait for a better quality print to become available - save your money on this one.Larry"
2,The difficulty kills this game,"This game is IMPOSSIBLE! You only have ONE health bar and ONE life...that's it! When you die,it's right back to the start of the game.It's a shame too,because this game is actually pretty freaking cool.It's got an awesome storyline and the graphics and concept were truly ahead of their time,but oh my lord....what a hard game this is.I've heard it said before that this game is very short,but how am I gonna know if I keep dying over and over???? Overall,if you wanna get this for you're Genesis collection,then I would recommend this game,but as far as playing it goes....I hope you love one HELL OF A CHALLENGE."
1,Promising start but disappointing,I was looking forward to reading this book and was ultimately very disappointed by the lack of development of both the characters and storyline (what storyline?). Meaningless drivel.... we know the indie scene has got to have more depth than this book portrays....
4,Art aproximates life,"This is an engaging send up & celebration of the indie rock scene, that draws you further in with each chapter. Pagan can weave together shimmering sentences that make my mouth water and read a book more slowly, anticipating when the next glittering jewel may come, Evelyn Wood or no. At this books conclusion, chills ran up my spine, maybe because it approximated my dreams, maybe because Pagan's gifted, or maybe both."
3,A band trying to make it big.,"In the story the Exes, Hank and Lilly who have previously dated, decide to start a band. Lilly, who has a wild personality comes up with the idea that the members of the band have had to have dated each other before. They serch high and low for a drumer and a bass player who have dated in the past before finding Shaz and walt. The rest of the story is about band trying to make it in a world of harsh cridicts and tough crouds, but also the good times the band goes through. This book has four chapters dedicated to each one of the members of the band, that tells what they really think about each other and mainly focuses on that one person. You will like this story if you like books about real people in the real world."
4,"Veronica, what do you think ?","I gave this book to a friend of mine (Veronica) and we both thought it was good, better in some places than others. The author gets the whole feel of being trapped in a van with ex-lovers who are your fellow band members as you cross the frozen tundra of America. The book is divided into four parts, one part each told by a different band member. The first part starts out fine, and the second part is the best of the four. this is told from the lead singer's point of view, and her dealings with men at their occasional worst is very interesting as she explains here different feelings as the men in her life act as pigs. Hey veronica, email me at aol.com and let me know what you think of this review."
1,Reviewing the review,"The correct spelling is ""drummer"" for ""drumer"", ""critics"" for ""cridicts"" and ""crowds"" for ""crouds"". If the spelling of the reviewer is any indication of his, or her, ability to speak and/or convey his (or her) thoughts, then we're all in trouble."
2,Not worth the read.,"I was initially excited about reading this, but found the author used crude language and tired, stereotypical conventions to paper over what was really a boring and flat story. 3/10. Not the worse thing I've ever read, but still a stinker."
1,More Liberal Modernist Nonsense,"This book is not an accurate response to the Question of Homosexuality from the Church's perspective. It reads like another diatribe of unorthodox modernist thinking. Please, spare the faithful, expecially those of us who are same-sex attracted and who led lives of unbridled sin before coming back to a Sacramental Life within the Church. If you are completely content on rationalizing away the Faith, which was purchased at great price for your salvation, or if you are looking for another book to justify your hatred for the Catholic position then this book is for you. Scholarly shmolarly, there are plenty of scholars in hell. Start your reading plan with books by Father Harvey and Benedict Groeschel. Even better, read JP II's Theology of the Body so that you may begin to understand the context and rationale for the Catholic position."
3,Anna!,"Tolstoy's writing of Anna Karenina has been hailed as another one of his misogynist look at a female character. Framing Anna Karenina: Tolstoy, The Woman Question, and the Victorian Novel by Amy Mandelker argues that Tolstoy is really portraying a modern woman of his day. Mandelker brings her academic s analysis to dissect and use a difference lens in understanding modern feminism.A fascinating different perspective to experience Tolstoy's seminal work and interesting read."
3,"Great for the UK, but not the USA","Much of the ingredients described in the book are UK-specific, so without a good translator (and the ability to find foods that aren't widely available in the US), it's of rather limited utility in the US. Probably a great book if you're in the UK though."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book to help me provide healthy, fun and good tasting finger foods for my 1 year old. The recipes seem to be geared more for older toddlers, and not for ""babies."" I expected there to be at least one recipe for babies, since the title indicated as such. I am very disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money,"I hated it! I opened it once read through it and closed it forever. There are foods that I have never heard of before, and most everything is measured in grams. That is not how we do thing here in america. Next to the grams were oz. more like it, but, who in their rigfht mind is going to measure food for toddlers by the ounces and have time!! I just wanted something simple like things I can throw together to make my life easier and my kids healthier, you won't find it here. Title is great thats all!"
2,"""Let's Get Physical"" '80's style cookbook","This book is really dated, the photographs are nice if you're nostalgic for the ""Let's Get Physical"" cheeseball aspect of the '80's. Although some sound appetizing, I have to admit I've never actually tried any of the recipes. I guess they're meant to be gourmet healthfood dishes geared toward fitness enthusiasts & body builders, but the lack of nutritional breakdowns seems to render them useless for anyone seriously intending to use them for that purpose."
2,Not What I Expected,"These are not what I expected and work differently that I thought. You should know that you can't put them in the bottom of the oven like the cheap aluminum one I was trying to replace. You are supposed to put it on the bottom rack in your oven. Well I only HAVE 2 racks and this takes up one of them. It doesn't really say if you can put things on the liner and it would be hard to because these liners are about the thickness of a garbage bag and slicker than goose #!*@. When I tried to slide a pan onto the rack this liner was on, the liner just slid to the back of the rack and crumpled up. Maybe I'm using them wrong but if so, the included directions for use are really bad."
1,Avoid This Oven Liner!,"The Wilton Oven liner CANNOT be used on the floor of the oven, it is placed on a rack. I purchased it for my mother for Xmas, and had to buy a new one at the last minute. I bought the Chef's Planet Oven Liner, and was thrilled. It is Much, Much Heavier material-- you can tell it is a superior product immediately out of the box. It is about $5 more than the Wilton, but believe me, it is worth it. Here is the link to it.Chef's Planet 23-Inch x 16.25-Inch Nonstick Oven Liner"
1,"Junk, And It's In The Garbage","As others have said, this goes on the bottom rack and therefore is a total waste of time and money. Mine went into the trash after a few weeks. Replaced it with one that goes on the bottom of the oven itself. This is real junk."
1,Disappointing,"I was quite excited to find this product from Wilton at a good price, but when it arrived, the directions read that it had to be placed on an oven rack, could not be used in the bottom of the oven. I have a convection wall oven, I can't give up a rack! So, I sent it back, which cost nearly $6 My mom bought me one at a dollar store for $5 which can be used on the bottom, which is working just fine so far. Too bad the directions weren't on the Amazon page."
4,Does the trick but . . .,"the liner is a little less substantial than I had expected and they recommend not using it on the floor of the oven. That means you can only use it on the bottom rack. But it does fit my oven perfectly, is easy to clean and even dishwasher-safe."
4,Not bad,Works pretty good. Catches the food particles and is very easy to clean. Now I don't have that burnt smell when I try and use my oven. Don't have to use the self clean oven as often.Bad thing is it takes up a rack and can't be put on the bottom of the oven.
5,Great Time Saver,"We use our oven a lot and I was in the habit of cleaning it at least twice per month. Not with these babies ~ I just pull them out, wash them in the the sink with dishsoap and put them back in the oven. Now I clean the over twice per year. I highly recommend these liners."
4,Great Product,I recommend these for everyone. Makes cleaning the oven SO much easier!! Nothing sticks to it. Great for the elderly as well.
3,a page turner of the adolescent kind,"I picked up The Skeleton In The Closet while looking for more M.C.Beaton books. I love her ""cozies"" - Hamish Mcbeth and Agatha Raisin series (of which I have read all). But this book left me wanting more - more character development, more plot momentum. ""Skeleton"" seemed thrown together somehow. The intertesting characters and situations were skimmed through and loose ends - left undone.I finished it quickly hoping the best was yet to come and it ended nicely but without the satisfaction a better book would have held.I would reccommend the Marion Chesney (M.C. Beaton) Edwardian Murder Mystery series: Snobbery with Violence, Hasty Death, Sick of Shadows, and Our Lady of Pain. I do hope she'll continue with the series as they are great fun!"
2,Not her best work,"I love MC Beaton, but this book was a disappointment after reading all of her Hamish Mcbeth books. I love all of that series...maybe it's the character I love.I found nothing much to like in the two misfits in Skeleton In The Closet. They get into trouble and bumble themselves out. Pretty dull, actually, but I Did finish it so I guess it's worth 2 stars. If you're looking for another Hamish Mcbeth (As I was, I must admit) then don't buy this book."
2,One Series Too Many,"""The Skeleton in the Closet"" introduces new characters by M.C. Beaton, who is ""taking a break from her two long-running series."" I love Hamish, I love Agatha. But I do NOT love Fell and Maggie. They are dull and uninteresting. This series is one too many, and Ms. Beaton is stretching her creative powers too thin.I did not care about the characters, the plot was negligible, the setting never came to life. I read half of this book, then skipped stratight to the end, which was so predictable. Please, Ms. Beaton, use your wonderful creativity on Hamish and Agatha, and lay this series to rest!"
2,Teenage Romance Novel,"Marion Chesney (M C Beaton) has a gift for story invention, but the level of writing is at the teenage level. I gave this story a read because I enjoy the Hamish Macbeth stories. The story is simple but likable about two adult losers that find each other. They grope towards each other with the sophistication of two inexperienced teenagers. The mystery is simple and predictible. A real murderer would have easily killed the two of them and gotten away with it. I wish Chesney would spend some time editing and rewriting her stories--the use of language is so jumpy. I finally skimmed the book--it was not worth spending any more effort upon. Two stars for story invention. Shame on you Ms Chesney--a person of you talent should be a better writer."
3,Chopped Lacan...,"This book offers you a basis for the understanding of Mr. Lacan that starts with a section for kids, if I should rank the level... The main goal,indicated in the subtitle, the comprehension of the unconscious as structured like a language, is made very clear. That might be a good point for a twist of interpretation in those inclined to think of psychoanalysis as obscure esoterism... On the other hand, this book is self-contained, and so does not discuss with a tradition...so it has the taste of a textbook...anyway, I would recommend it if you have no idea of who this guy Lacan was...I would recommend also that you buy Seminar 1, and if possible read some of Louis Althusser's papers about the importance of Lacan. And if in the end you don't understand him completely, don't worry, you're part of a big group of people."
3,50s Rock and Roll?,I bought this to do a compilation disc for a reunion and there were about 4 songs that were actual hits by Frankie back in the day. These seem to be from the original tapes and they are clean with good sound reproductions. There are a couple of songs that are pretty bad but that goes with the territory.
1,Sounded too Good to be True,"Read the reviews of this product by both consumers and manufacturer. Ordered the product based on the reviews only to find out that this item is not compatible with Windows XP. Would have been nice to list system requirements so people can know whether or not to order. If defeats the purpose to find out only after you've ordered and received the product that it's not compatible with your system, and you have to return it."
2,"Mostly junk, very disappointing","The quality of the clip art, raster images and photographs is mostly bad. The vector images seem to be traced freehand sketches. I would say about 80% is useless."
1,"As others say, it's a dead loss","Don't be fool. There are not 600,000 images in the box, as many are repeated two, three or more times. Especially when it comes to photos, browse a whole folder and you should notice that many are repeated in the same folder and even between folders. So how many images are there actually in the package? I would go for half, if it's not less.And they are not quality images for the most part. So believe me, this product is total crap. When you have bought once, you will never buy again."
1,Waste of time and money...,Art Explosion should do just that - EXPLODE! It is just TIME CONSUMING trying to find what you want. The software doesn't have all of the graphics the user's manual does. Don't waste your time buying this... The art in here looks like a third grader's! The FEW that are good (and there are FEW) look amateurish. What a RIP-OFF!!! I can't believe they sell this junk to people.
3,Graphics good... organization poor,"I read the reviews that many had been written before I made this purchase and found them to be accurate. The graphics are great. More than I will ever be able to use but the organization of the system is poor at best. There needs to be a seach function. I remember one of my first purchases of Printmaster had a search disc that referred you to the disc that contained the graphic you wanted.The book sent with the Explosion software is fine but again it's not easy to use. No one has time to look through the whole book looking for a specific subject.Maybe I haven't spent enough time trying to figure it out but so far, it's frustrating.I might also add, my one attempt with getting help from their help-line left me on hold until I gave up."
1,Disappointed,"Boy, I really wanted to like this-especially after seeing it got 5 stars by other reviewers. However, I ended up returning it. It is an enormous collection and I have no complaint about the quality. The problem is the search engine. THERE ISN'T ONE.!! Finding an image is a labor of Hercules. Even the book they supply containing most of the images (the photo images are not included) is poorly conceived. The images are small, black&white and poor quality - some so dark and grainy that I couldn't make them out even using a magnifier.I was looking forward to using this impressive set, but it isn't worth the trouble. You just can't find your images. It isn't searchable."
1,Worst ever!,"This is a shockingly bad game, especially since Konami is known for previous games that were good. The play is too fast, players and puck are just blurs. You can't see a thing, let alone play the game. There's probably a much better hockey game out there for regular old fashoned, black and white Gameboy."
1,What kind of game is this?,"konami has accomplished nothing by making this game. what a waste of plastic and microchips. in hopes that this hockey game would be good, it isn't! you might as well forget taking the puck to the opposing goal because chances are you won't even make it that far. konami should stop making hockey games and stick to games that don't involve much thought in producing. all this game is good for is wedging it under the leg of an unbalanced table or chair. if you are a loser, then this game is for you."
3,It's Arbor Day Charlie Brown,The product was fine for the price I paid. The video case was in poor condition--but I wasn't expecting brand new.
5,Something to bring you back in the day,Awesome singing on here. I use this all the time before preaching and reaching! These are some songs that will remind you of the faith and how far we have drifted away from the songs that brought conviction to one's faith in God and their committment. A must buy!!!
3,Meh,"It began well, kind of like A Wrinkle in Time meets Tron. But towards the middle it just became a long winded lesson on how computers and the solar system works. And then it just ends. Very little closure or explanation. I think the author has potential, but the story still has a lot of work left. Pretty disappointed."
3,"Started well, rambled in the middle and then... just ended","This book really had two parts: about 1/3 with the children's father as the central character and then 2/3 focusing on the children.The first part was enjoyable. The style reminded me of certain sweet books I read when I was young or sweet children's stories I saw on video with my kids when they were little. The story had enough little twists to keep my interest and seemed to provide something I look for in a good book: creativity.The second part started out in the same vein, but once the children entered a different world, it began to ramble and drift and it was difficult to figure out the point of it all. The ending was abrupt and didn't really seem to be an ending at all."
5,An Enjoyable Story,"I'm not sure what age group this book is for, but I enjoyed it. There were lots of parts that I could imagine a child reading and enjoying, and then there were parts where the material seemed a little too grown-up for a younger child. The moral of the story is one that everyone should get. This would be a great book for someone going into middle school. Nice job.Carole McKee, Author"
4,Lots of variety,"My favorite thing about this book is the variety of recipes. I own several baking books, so I didn't need another book with recipes for a basic brownie or chocolate chip cookies (unless either is amazing). This book definately didn't disappoint with tons of recipes that I hadn't seen before.Of course there are the standard recipes that you could find in any baking book, but there are also recipes for things like curry refrigerator cookies, bay leaf poundcake, and buttermilk pie that you just don't come across very often.There are also a lot of recipes in this book. The font is fairly small, and there are over 500 pages, so there are literally hunderds of recipes for everything from pies to crackers to cakes and cookies."
5,BEST Baking book ever,All I can do is echo the rave reviews of others here. Every single recipe I've used has come out perfect. I especially love the old fashioned and little heard recipes for pies and cookies. I always wondered what Shoo-Fly Pie was! I've even made the dog biscuit recipe in the back of the book. Four paws up from my dogs for those! My favorite go-to treat is the Lemon Squares as I have a Myer Lemon tree in the yard that produces a lot of fruit. Better than any bakery or store bought that's for sure. Another surprising treat is the Apple Wine turnovers.
5,Best baking book,I had been using this baking book for years. Bought mine 10 years ago for its traditional recipes. my nephew and his new wife bought a house and she wanted to learn more on cooking. I bought her bothe the baking and cookbook. it is a great set for cooks of all levels. it has real meals not the oversized portions of most recipe books. the recipes are laid out well. hope they enjoy theirs as much as I have mine.
5,Great book for baking,"This is another good cookbook, directions are easy to read and I haven't had to ""tweak"" the recipes much to my own tastes. Good basic cookbook for the newly housekeeper. Must have along with the Fannie Farmer Cookbook and The Joy of Cooking cookbook."
3,Needs Errata listing,"The recipe for Springerle cookies omitted a leavening agent. Needless to say, the cookies turned out inedible. How many other serious errors are there in this book?"
1,Wrong Book,The book I ordered was the Fannie Farmer Baking Book 1984 edition. I received the Original Boston Cooking-School Cook Book 1896 edition.
3,Nice detailed book.,"I was looking for a more feminine point of view. The title lead me to believe that it was more ""mother"" oriented."
5,Excellent!,"This is just about the best book I've ever read regarding Native American/Sioux rituals and spirituality. Eagle Man wrote this in a precise yet very readable manner; it was easy to comprehend and understand. I also enjoyed the personal stories that he included.This is the first book I've found that has very specific instructions on the proper way to perform rituals, such as the sweat lodge, Sun Dance, etc., with background on how these rituals began and their significance in conjunction with other rituals. I've been to several pow wows in my area, but never really understood the meaning behind various rituals that were performed. I'm really glad I bought this book, it's definitely a keeper."
4,Great Secrets Unearthed. . .,"Finally someone with the courage to share about the Native Ceremonies to all colors. I was recommended this book by a Lakota friend of mine, and was truly impressed. While McGaa's writing style is a little more matter-of-factly than I would like, it shared very valuable information. . . Everything from an explanation of the Ceremonial Pipe, to Sun Dance as well as other wonderful ceremonies. Definately a great book for anyone interested in Native ceremonies, particularly the Lakota way."
5,Great Read,"A nice reference to many traditions of the native american cultures, how they perform and keep tradition throughout the centuries."
5,"A ""Must Have "" Book ! I Rate this Book 6 Stars , Indeed !","I find myself refering back to this book , again and again ! It is very well written and enjoyable to read . If you are interested in Native America this is a "" Must Have "" Book ."
3,Interesting book but only half way through.,Will comment later after I have read this book through. Read about half and will not comment until I am qualified to do so!John Chambers
3,Mother Earth Spirituality : Native American Paths to Healing Ourselves and Our World (Religion and Spirituality),"Easy to read and understand. Very ""down to earth"". A guide book to preparing the necessary items and tools of the Native culture. Very well written."
2,Not Best,"Very disappointed in this CD called the Best of Nana Mouskouri. In my opinion it certainly isn't her best by any means. She is singing in foreign languages for most of the selections, and they are only boring to me. I have three of her early cassettes, Return to Romance, 1 and 2, and The very Best of Nana Mouskouri, and they are truly her best that I have heard. I just wanted them on a CD for obvious reasons, but alas I payed a lot for a real disappointment."
3,It's OK,It's a little harsh andmore like chicory than anythign else. Go with just the Vanilla which much better and authentic tasting.
4,WRONG ORDER,I THOUGHT I ORDERED A BLUEBERRY FLAVORED COFFEE. I ALREADY HAVE 4 BOXES OF THE VANILLA PLEASE CHANGE THE ORDER BEFORE3 IT IS SHIPPED OUT.
1,"wierd ""oily"" taste",I drink about 5 k-cups of coffee a day. I have mix of all flavors. This one sounded really good. I tried it the day it arrived and can't stand it.It seems to have a oily taste to me.
3,"Tastes like almond, not caramel","I agree with another review that this coffee tastes like almond, not caramel. The taste is okay, but nothing special. This is not one of our favorite flavored coffees. In fact, I do not plan on ordering any more when my wife and I use up what I bought.If you want to try a really delicious caramel flavored coffee, I recommend Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla, which I have reviewed on Amazon.IMPORTANT: Carefully check the price before you order this coffee from any seller. A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping."
3,Reminds me of Almonds,"This flavor sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. I normally drink hazelnut or carmel vanilla cream flavored k-cups. This is flavorful, but it tastes and smells like almond extract, which I am not a huge fan of. I totally agree with another viewer that you may want to try it first before buying a large quantity. I am glad I did, there are others I like much better."
3,ODD,"This coffee just has an odd taste. I think the flavor that is suppose to be ""caramel"" is what is a bit off. I can tolerate it, but it isn't something I really ENJOY drinking. For anyone that is looking to try new varieties of k cups at home I recommend ordering through BigCatCoffees. There you can create custom variety boxes. It costs a tad more, but at least you don't get stuck with whole boxes of a product you don't like."
1,Item not as described,"The Cd came to me in a plastic slim pack with no inlay and back artwork and a photo copy of front cover of the album.I thought the word DIG in the title of this item means digi-pack, but the product I have is not as I wish for.Totally unacceptable. I ask them for explanations but never reply to me."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"The singer is absolutely terrible. If you don't like the singer it completely ruins the album, the guy is wailing over every second of every track, with absolutely no variation in pitch or style. What a waste of what could have otherwise been a fairly decent cd."
2,"Creative band, up until now","I don't really understand why they expanded the band like this and made this stupid album unless they really are trying to be more commercial and get a bigger fanbase. This whole album just sounds like the Mars Volta with less character. The whole thing is kind of bland, the singer is lame and they've really de-evolved as a band by expanding the group and going in this direction with the music. I think they should have released this under a different name, because it's really not Hella in more ways than just the make up of the musicians"
4,Hella good!,"I'll admit I didn't like this band before. It was a bass player and drummer just jamming out and it was kind of annoying. Now they added a singer and a guitarist(s). So how is it? Pretty good. Some of the vocals remind me alot of the mars volta. One thing I will say is this band knows when to end songs. The music is crazy but it's not masturbatory like most of TMV. Hopefully, Hella will make new fans after this one."
1,Blessed are the Narcissistic,"A resource for depression????PLEASE do not use this book as a resource for depression! Respect yourself and the condition by seeking professional help, ie. books written by those who have actually studied the condition. Just because someone claims the title ""Christian"" and tosses around biblical terms that does not make them a trustworthy resource. I found the book to be rather self-serving as opposed to any actual resource for depression."
2,It gets dull,"When I first got this game, I thought it was kind of cool, but then a week later, it got really boring. It sounds like its really fun, 5 games in 1, but it just keeps having you repeat the levels. You get hidden games but those are dull from first sight. The bottom line is:it gets dull."
4,"The Lion The Flagman The Sparky, The 10","This game is the best game i have until the game and watch gallery 4 came out. This game was the second i brought even though the game was the 3rd to come out. This game has ten games. The three games i wrote for the titkle are part of the game. The game also includes 7 more games. the games are turtle bridge, egg, greenhouse, donkey kong, and more that i can't name because i forgot. This game has a music area and you could do anything you like to fix the music in the area.Then the important area is the gallery corner. the game is great succeed. ..."
2,A Sales Pitch For The Author's Products,"Of course the author is going to review his own book with high marks, Da? And I think the second high review is also made either by the author or his best friend.This book contains only the most basic information on low level laser light therapy. The rest of the book is focused on the author's own products. I believe this book to be a self published effort, as the editing and writing do not really reach a professional level. The author has lots of ideas as to why his products are the best, but fails to provide the proof necessary to support his claims.If you want to read a really good, in depth, well written, scientifically supported book on low level laser light therapy (LLLT) read: Low Level Laser Therapy: A Practical Introduction by Ohshiro and Calderhead. It's really expensive since it is out of print and in great demand. I got my copy to read from the library on an interlibrary loan, at no cost."
3,Not a bad place to start,"The variety and number of different rock hits in this book are sure to please a various tastes and skills. I selected this book to help with my personal and instructor-led guitar instruction, and am pleased that it will be a good accompaniment to my learning. If you are unexperienced at reading guitar tab, the book could be somewhat challenging since instructions on how to read the guitar tablature are not included. For the price, you can't go wrong."
2,Songs are incomplete,"For anyone looking to find a song book, this is not it. From the table of contents this would appear to be a good book with plenty of variety. But the songs in the book are incomplete. For example, one of the songs listed in the book is Dust in the Wind by Kansas. This book gives you the tab for about 5 measures of the intro and that is about it. I guess you could ""fake"" it as long as you only wanted someone to see you play the intro. Disappointing."
4,A True Blackstar,"I admit I initially picked up this cd for two reasons: (1) I love Track 3 ""Wishing"" and (2) I used to go to school with this chick. I expected a pretty decent album, but I was completely blown away by the versatility and soul that is exhibited throughout this cd. It's definitely a shame her first project didn't get as much exposure, but I think this one will definitely stir up a lot of attention. Take a listen, and experience a real black star."
4,Where she at?,"This CD is nice. It's got great beats. And the song ""Friday"" is tight! She just has not gotten any airtime. Good music though."
4,I love those old re-runs!,"The ""Hear Me"" album was a breath of fresh air in an era when quality offerings are few and far between. My main gripe with blackstar is ITS EXACTLY THE SAME! The producers have gone into the studio, placed the CD in pressed the randomize button! Strong album, the girl can clearly sing but we've been waiting 4 years for new material."
5,New and Fantastic!!,"I had the pleasure of hearing Yahzarah perform in Washington, DC - I have been waiting for this CD to come out for months! I'm so glad that it did not disappoint. Every song on Blackstar is quality! While my favorite is Cry - I'm finding something new on the CD every time I hear it."
2,What?,"I really wanted to like this album. Honestly, I really did. Her voice is beautiful and she definitely has a lot of soul, but the songs just aren't cutting it for me. Being a former Erykah Badu backup vocalist, I expected something at least a little out of the ordinary, a little quirky, something unique. But I didn't get it. The songs and production are generic, if not cheesy. They could've been done by absolutely anyone. They have no personality. They are boring and I could not make it through this album without pressing the skip button in the middle of almost every track. (That's when you know the song is doomed, and it's not going to get better.) The only songs I like, or even remember for that matter, are the ""Yah Intro,"" ""Bury It"" and ""Baby Love."" The title track's alright. Words cannot express my disappointment. I hope she comes with it next time around, if there is one."
2,yah-za-huh?,"Hmmm.. this album was so off I am not sure where to even start. I had read quite a few reviews of this cd that all suggested that this was a great album that was just being slept on. I also read that she had worked with Erykah Badu and the two combined lured my into this purchase.She has a strong start to her album and then it all goes downhill from there. I kept thinking that I just needed to give it time and let it grow on me. I was dumb enough to keep listening to this album over the course of 2 weeks By the end of the two weeks I sold her to another sucka on Ebay.It's not her voice that I found so annoying, it was definately her lyrics. Imagine an Aaliyah tribute album sung by your neice and her friends.. or an unofficial star search girl that landed a record deal. It just should never have been. My advice is for her to call Badu back and beg to do back-up."
3,Mixed Feelings,"A great new voice for soul music paired with weak material. The production was dated and lacking in creativity. Sometimes I felt that the vocal arrangements were a little overdone, I would love to hear her sing a very sparse ballad and just let her soul shine through. She is very gifted vocally so less can be more for her, the same cannot be said for many of today's R'n'B singers. Standout track for me is ""Black Star"""
1,This is a USB 1.1 Hub!,"Just in case it's not obvious to other people, a word of warning is that this is a USB 1.1 hub (does not support USB 2.0). I didn't pick up on that from the description and ended up having to return it. Amazon was great with the return considering I had opened the item before realizing it wasn't the right hub for my needs."
3,Works fine but made cheap,"The hub does its job and worked w/o a hitch but the build quality definitely leaves something to be desired. It literally came apart in my hand, luckily the plastic covers snaps back in place easily. So if your getting a USB hub that will be moved/travel alot I would look elsewhere."
2,"Unfortunately, Greatest Songs isn't complete","Sadly, Love Me Tender and My Elusive Dreams are omitedThis is not one of Eddy's b est albums either, but I am a die hard Eddy Arnold fan. Sadly, the original release does not contain Love Me Tender, and, My Elusive Dreams. I would love to have these two songs if anybody has tehse. I am 28 and have been an Eddy Arnold fan all my life. Greatest Songs is not a favorite and his version of Green Green Grass Of Home isn't even all that good. Casual Eddy Arnold fans should start with his early works before buying this one, but be for warned. The CD is missing My Elusive Dreams, and Love Me Tender"
3,Generous with three stars!!,"I'm not really happy with this recording. Either this CD has been remastered way too much, or I don't remember the real Eddy Arnold. This really lacks the smooth voice I remember and sometimes, it seems the words are said so slowly, the music should have stopped.Jodi S."
1,WHYYYYY?!?!?!?,"I'll make it simple, this game, this trash, is an insult to the HM series. I bought this game a long time ago (like a few months after its release), and I still regret I ever had it (sold it the next day). Yea so you can marry the spoil brat Lumina, and your clothes change with the seasons, different heart events, decide if you want a boy or girl, etc etc etc. WHO CARES?! I just could not get over the MAJOR glitch, the SLOW MOTION crap! This was very, very, VERY, annoying. Yes, I had heard about the glitch, but seeing how I love every HM game out there, but noooo I didn't listen, I had to try it out. Now who ever still owns or still plays this . . . PROPS to you, for you ARE the TRUE HM fan! Maybe if the glitch didn't screw this game up, it could have had some purpose or tastefulness to it."
2,A buggy port,"I owned the original version for the Gamecube but decided to purchase this after my Gamecube broke. Needless to say, I regret that I did. First off, this game has constant frame rate drops. In areas with heavy vegetation, the drop in fps is very noticeable. Secondly, when trying to navigate the soil patches, there is a lag time between when you push the analog stick to when the character actually moves.Game could've been fun, the original was, but the technical issues prevented me from enjoying it. Buy at your own risk."
2,What were they thinking?,"Okay, I bought this game brand new, not opened or touched or any of that.I took it home, expecting to be amazed again by natsume's marvelous video games, since I am an harvest moon fan. I ran to my room popped the harvest moon game into my playstation2 and waited to be left in awe. At first, nothing really bad popped out in my face, but then, I saw it. The graphics were horrible, and it took so long to load just to walk in your house!!! I do give natsume a bit of credit for making the dating scenes more exciting, but that's only one star now is't it? To make a long story short, it was a total waste of money and time!!"
2,ps2 should be a shamed,"well it looks like ps2 messed this game up bigtime... the reviews here dont lie... all the game does everytime you ""open a door"" is load...i got the verry same game on gamecube and it is waaay better than this peace of junk! dont waste your money!"
3,Too Slow to be enjoyable!,I like Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life Special Edition. I however recommend spending an extra $100 dollars for a Gamecube. The Gamecube Edition is faster and easier to play. Sure there are extra features in the special edition but it isn't worth it to wait for more than a few seconds to move your character and other simple actions.
2,Harrrrvvesstt Moo... ... ...LOADING... .... ...ooon.,"I've been an avid fan of the HM series ever since I first played the first SNES one, what, ten years ago? They're all very addicting, except this one. I thought this would be an excellent game, but I simply cannot get into it. Because, during the time that the game isn't LOADING, all movement is soooo sloooooooowwwwwwww. The scenery is at least.. slightly pretty? Not really. Everything looks so dingy, the colours have barely any saturation.Gameplay, apart from being so very slow, as far as I can tell is also confusing, because it confused me and I'm usually a fast learner. Initially I thought the ""special edition"" would be the girl's version, where you play the girl and marry one of the guys in town... but I honestly can't find what's special about this 'edition.' Judging by how slow it is, maybe they just meant.. ""special."""
4,Lightening bolt necklace,"I bought this necklace as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and gets alot of compliments on it. We both thought that it would be larger but should have read the dimensions closer. I wear it myself once in awhile, it is a unique piece of jewelry."
5,Great Condition!,This book looks completely brand new even though it was listed as used. Couldn't be happier!
4,Good introductory to Pauline theology,"This study takes Godet's thoughts on the New Testament and narrows the scope specifically to Paul and his doctrinal stances. It's more of a generalized summary on Paul's letters, and doesn't get very deep or overly technical. It's a good resource for introductory level Bible students looking to go deeper into the Word. I recommend this with his other study on the New Testament, which covers tother themes and the four Gospels. Both are great suppliments for busy pastors.For the serious study on Paul, Godet's commentaries on 1 St Corinthians and Romans are excellent, but are decidely for those with an aptitude for Greek."
5,"Don't ask me, Ask the Dogs !",I like them better than Greenies or Freshies due to their cost and ingredients.. the dogs.. they'd eat the whole box at once if I'd let the.. think that says it all.
4,Works as advertised,"Just returned from a 450+ mile trip using the Highland Duffel. The duffel (and contents) remained totally dry despite traveling through a moderate rain storm. The cover must have been improved since earlier reviews, because mine was undamaged following the trip."
4,good product,"I had thought the product would be much bigger. I made a 600+ mile drive the day after a snow storm, it held up through all of the nasty slush and everything stayed dry. I love that it has the wheels and an outer shell. Others said it was hard to put the cover on but I found it rather easy. Wasn't sure about the tie downs that it came with so i added another just for piece of mind."
3,Inexpensive for a reason...,"Bought the rolling duffel because it was advertised as waterproof and as a rolling duffel. If you only ever put this on the top of your car and did so VERY carefully, it might last for a while. If you use it for camping or travel it is too flimsy for frequent use. The main duffel is made of vinyl plastic and is subject to puncturing or tearing. There is an outer nylon cover that ties on but it is impractical to use anywhere except on the car top since you won't be able to get to carrying handles with the cover on. So if you need occasional extra luggage space in the form of a car top carrier, this may do the trick. If you're looking for something that can be used for multiple purposes and stand up under moderate to frequent use, spend more and get something sturdier. This absolutely won't do for airline travel."
2,Definately not what I expected,"If your using this to pack for 1 person, you might be ok. It's not your typical roof top carrier!"
4,Highland Cartop Luggage Duffel - Worth It,"Bought this because the hardtops were too expensive, and not as much volume. We went on vacation to Cape Cod from Jersey in an Xterra with two teenagers in the back. Duffels just fit between the Xterra cross bars after separating them as far as possible. We made the whole trip there and back including rain on the way home without any trouble. My one tip is FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS! The quality of the material is not bad for the money. The picture doesn't show the weather protection cover which doesn't look quite as cool as the duffle alone. I know it won't last forever, but it was worth the money."
1,"product is garbage, do not buy.","you plug it in , it does nothing. great money making idea for the company. they also charge 3 dollars a minute for customer support. it cost more than the product itself to tell them it does not work. the genius who came up with that should get a raise. it seems that iconcept is more of a scheme than a business, beware."

3,Worth a look for biker film aficionados!,"Bruce Dern again plays a mean biker creep! Unfortunate for an artist who runs into Dern and gets beaten up.Luckily a sexy young women comes to his rescue and nurses the artist back to health! Where can I find a woman like that, oh well only in the movies. the acting is bad but the bikes are cool daddio."
3,Uncut?,"I just watched this film and some of the dialouge was cut from the film, it says R-rated whats up with that?"
2,You get what you pay for.,"40 episodes for under twenty dollars? The sound track is OK... but this show demands a better release. Platinum have started with a really poor video image, then processed it to maximum sharpness, to create wide black and white outlines, then given the result maximim mpeg compression, creating exciting dancing patterns of mpeg artifacts.Contains all 40 shows in their volumes 1,2,3 and 4 (the double pack volume 1 has volume 2 with it!)."
5,Heavenly,"Addicting is right, these are delicious! I first bought them on vacation in Tennessee - they are wonderful to keep in the car and pop one (or several) in your mouth as a refresher while driving. I like to keep a can in my purse also. Then unable to find them at home, yikes! How happy I am to see Amazon carries them!"
3,Not bad...........,"This book is halfway decent. It reminds me a lot of back in the day programming little tricks in dos to make cool effects on the screen. Actually, it reminds me a lot of my high school computer science class when I already knew the language, so the teacher let me sit and make a graphics demo to teach the graphics portion of the class. I made a whole ton of demos of neat little tricks that were simple to do but had a good effect.That is what this book is like. You get a few neat tricks, but the problem I have with this is the same as all the others: too much beginner garbage. On top of that, the content does not allow you as much room for expansion beyond what it gives you.Bottom line:It's a buy next to many of the other books out there. But it's still not near the top dog, Programming Role-Playing games with DIrectX by Jim Adams is the best one."
5,A definite must buy!,"An all-around great album filled with energy, zest, and beauty at every turn. In my opinion, Altan's finest album!"
1,Bad product,This camera never worked properly. After half the film is used it rewinds thus you waste half a roll each time. I gave as a gift and the recipient did not want to tell me it did not work properly so I could not return it. Big disappointment.
3,The Eisenhower White House Years,"This volume, along with the earlier volume MANDATE FOR CHANGE, comprise President Dwight Eisenhower's Presidential memoirs. It does appear to be written by committee much more than his CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which describes his military activities during World War II and is rightly a classic. Yet is offers an invaluable perspective of this very misunderstood time in American history from the vantage point of the Oval Office. Rather than the bland or conformist image many of us have, this was actually a very eventful period, covering the dawn of the Space Age and the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Hungarian Revolution, the rise to power of Cuba's Fidel Castro, the dawn of the civil rights movement and finally, the Kennedy-Nixon campaign of 1960."
5,by bread alone,"i first read this book in high school 20 years ago and have never forgotten it, i purchased it last month and read it again (in 2 days) i want my teens to read it also, it is truely one of my best reads."
2,too complicated,This game is too complicated for the preschool age child it is intended for. It has too many steps and options for each play. My child does like just playing with the pieces and it is a bright and colorful game. We modify the rules to make playing easier.
1,Revisionist history?,"OK, here's a short quiz: The Titanic sank during what year? A. 1915. B. 1914 C. 1912. If you watched the first volume of Mandacy's Titanic: The Mystery and the Legacy, you were informed that the correct answer is B, 1914. From there, it's all downhill. The sound booms out of your speakers no matter how low you set it, and the opening title card ""Echoes of Titanic"" looks like someone scrawled it on a piece of cardboard and held it up to the camera. Oh, and just for the record, it sank in 1912."
2,mediocre documentary,"The worst parts are 1) the sound, often the words are unintelligible and the noise in background unbearable 2)the frequent repetitions of scenes across the 5 DVDs.Often boring. The interviews of survivors are endless.I couldn't watch more than two out of five.Other documentaries on the topic are much better than this."
2,"Good news, bad news...","Good news: my daughter had a blast decorating this light. It kept her happily occupied for several hours, and it was very cute when she was done.Bad news: after all that, it wouldn't turn on.Upshot: She liked it anyway, and kept it clipped by her bed to admire her art. It was a little late to take it back, anyway. But I had to buy her another lamp that actually worked.Moral of story: if you buy this product, make sure it works BEFORE you turn it over to the young artist."
1,Well written exposition of Serbian point of view,"Danielle Sremac is a Washington lobbyist for the Serbian Unity Congress. From 1992 until Nov, 1998 she was director of the Serbian-American Affairs Council. For the past year she has been head of the Institute for Balkan Affairs. She has been a paid representative of Serbia since 1992.If you want a one-stop source for the Serbian point of view on the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, this is it."
3,Common sense information,"This book is great if you have no idea how to write a complaint letter. However, most of us have common sense, and know how to express that we are ""shocked, appalled, and dismayed""! Also, this book discourages the use of certain words and phrases for no other reason than that the author doesn't like them, or thinks they are overused. This book does provide some useful information on how to contact people you may want to send a complaint letter to, but this information can easily be found on the web (for free)."
5,Every person in USA should have this book!,"I have the book for several years and its contents have saved me time and money over and over again. It is rich in samples of real letters and complaints, with real cases.I recommend to anyone that ever needs to write a complaint letter and/or need to reach government agencies."
1,FATMAN FOREVER,"This game is a joke.The graphics are pretty cool,because they are digitized,but other than that,the game totally blows! Batman is just some fat guy dressed up in a Batman costume,and the guy playing Robin,looks like he made up his costume,out of cheap used clothes that he bought from a thrift store.The sound is awful.The game play's like a Mortal Kombat rip-off.It's just a bad game.If you wanna get a really good Batman game for Genesis,pick up the original ""Batman"",based on the Tim Burton movie from 1989,and just stay away from this waste of time."
2,"Title should be called Batman ""tarnished"" Forever","I like the original Batman game for this system as oppose to this joke. The graphics are very good I will say that, but terrible gameplay. The fighting system in this game was different and it was more than just a rock'em sock'em still side scroller. I liked how each of the characters had a huge list of moves; and how you can use them in the dual mode. Despite this being a bad game overrall I remember myself and my brother loved playing this game back in the day. It was cool when I was a pre-teen but now its just one of those stale games."
2,Oh BOY,I love the graphics digitized graphics awesome one thing though gameplay much.Why couldn't have been a simple beat up the bad guys progress to the next level game Graphics over gameplay classic mistake. To use a gadget you have to put in a button combination like Mortal Kombat even the fighting engine was like Mortal Kombat. To get above and below areas is a chore. If I told you how to get above and to get below areas you'd be like WTF. Play Batman Forever Arcade on PS1 & Sega Saturan or download it on MAME 32 don't take my word for it Play it I dare ya? It's not as bad as some of the review's say but boy is this game baaaaaaaaaaaaad!
2,acclaim got lazy,"batman forever is Mortal kombat rebuilt for batman. they put MK's controls and suk random bat gizmo controls in it. i personally never beaten the game, but maby i just suck at it. that or i lost patiance with it because i can't get pat the first hole in the floor. do youself a favor and stay away from this pile of bat crap."
1,"Holy bad games, Batman!","This is just too bad. For such a cool character, Batman has had some bad luck with video games. This is probably the worst and that's saying a lot. This game is no fun (did you see the one star?) and is not worth anyone's time."
3,The Game is Good,I had this Game a long time ago but I remeber playing and It's not that bad it's fun You get to punch kick and do other Batman things with robin I never Finished it but the graphics are Good Not Like todays but they will do It's not such a bad game for being 7 Years old Trust me So try it out.
2,"Oh, god, I'm gonna get slapped...","...but I gotta be honest here.I saw Bad Boy exactly once. They rocked my socks off - no question.But the reason I dug up this CD was that I have almost all of the album _The Band Milwaukee Made Famous_ stuck in my head. Really: even if you've never heard of Bad Boy, or (as other reviewers have pointed up) the Bad Boy you remember had completely different personnel, you owe it to yourself to hear _Milwaukee_.But none of those songs are on this CD.So, I'm not so much disappointed with _Best Of_ - I'm just let-down that none of my Bad Boy favorites is on it."
4,"Cuban piano mixed with African guitars, pulsating horns","Many African bands have tried to sound Cuban: some have succeeded, but nobody has successfully captured the essence of both the way Ricardo Lemvo and Makina Loca have.Imagine Tito Puente or Johnny Pacheco at their salsa best mixed with occasional dashes of Franco or Tabu Ley Rochereau. Hot, hot, hot!"
5,Some of the best african tinged salsa and merengue you will hear,"The african here is mostly in the electric guitars and lyrics thrown in significantly enough for you to feel them, but not strongly enough that they give this album an overtly exotic feel. Many of the salsa and merengue tracks would feel just fine at any latin club. The band sounds tight with interplay between the instruments, specially on a track where the chorus urges the trumpet and flute to produce great jams.He changes the pace with a few of the tracks having a more African feel. These tracks might be a bit unusual for most latin music listeners, but they sure change the pace and throw a little humor.Most of the tracks are salsa and son based, with a couple of merengue and a couple of the African styles I cannot recognize."
3,Ways to simplify,"Paula Huston, almost crazed with her hectic life as a college instructor and a busy mom, sets out to simplify her life and deepen her spirituality, following the lead of great spiritual leaders of the past.I actually gasped out loud when I read the chapter where Huston realizes that the more effort she put into her spirituality, the more judgmental she seemed to be about other people; yep, I saw myself.While I liked some of Huston's ideas for simplifying and spiritualize-ing, I noticed that my mind kept wandering away from the pages of the book. Not sure why."
1,Holy Parody,"This is a book that covers the author's embarkation on a spiritual journey. She drenches her writing with quotes from spiritual authorities and rather shallow reflections on the techniques she encounters along the way.The author seems intent on proving that her enlightened liberal worldview is a natural outgrowth of ageless spiritual traditions. If you want to read about NPR and Volvos, semaphore for ""hey, this isn't conservative evangelical crap, I'm a liberal like you!"" intermixed with flat observations about solitude and simplicity, buy this book.The book reads as if the author was provided a proposal from a publisher to reach out to the Left with an alternative spiritual path that does not subvert in any way what progressives already hold to be true. That would certainly account for the manner in which the author handles her mission. God only knows if she has accomplished what she was sent forth to do."
1,never delivered,"I have never received this item, but because I have paid 0.79 cents for this cable I would not even spend a minute to try to get this item. I will never use that company to buy anything from them!"
3,little boring but decent fare,This book has been advertised as comic and touching. Well for Liverpool residebts its fine since the language used is too dialectical. The main story is good and absorbing but deliberately and excess camaraderie is shown among the servants the master. It seems artificial at times.Not bad for a rainy afternoon but tends to drag at times. I had to skip over many pages to keep the interest going....Rachita
3,Pretty good book,"I read this book awhile though. It is about a girl who is kidnapped and put in a cellar with just some food and water, plus she has her typewriting and backpack. This book was interesting, but I hated the ending!!! I wish there were a sequel to this book!"
3,soul searching.,"Finding it hard to put the book down it is quite the page turner, although it is slow paced. No genre fits this book, in fact; it's in it's own genre. I wanted an ending because the book built my mind up to so many different cinclusions and it ust left me there with no closure. But when you are soul searching there is no end so the book fits the concept and the way it involves around so many personal issues in life its a wonderful journey."
2,"Thought provoking, but unsutible for the young reader","This is a thought provoking book for mature readers. It is increadibly suspenceful and effective. The lack of closure is frustrating, and leads the reader to conclude the worst. Anyone reading this book must be prepared that it is written only from the view of the victim, and the questions all readers have are never answered. The lack of closure, and horror strcken setting, make it unsuitable for younger readers. It should not be classified as a young adult book. Read with caution!"
4,scary,"i cant believe that none of the other reviews mentioned how scary this book is. as far as i understand it, its also aimed at teens -- this is way too disturbing. yes, the ending doesnt explain anything, but i saw that not as a detriment but more along the lines that this book is just SCARY. i read it when i was a young man, and i dont remember it all that well specifically, but i remember enough to know that i would not read it again. reminded me of 'johnny got his gun' as far as being short and leaving the reader feeling pretty terrible."
3,"Interesting, but there isnt't any closure.","This novel raises many unanswered questions which I felt were hard to get past: ""Why was she kidnapped?"" ""Who kidnapped her?"" I found that the novel does a good job of mainstream writing, but that was really the only thing that I found positive about the novel. Sure, Jackie has lots of time to think things over, but I do not feel that the novel has a complete sense of reality for how serious the plot line is. I would not recommend teaching this novel in a classroom unless you are looking for a book critically analyze against a novel like The Diary of Anne Frank ."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Book","I read this book this summer, I read it for school. I found that if i did not have to read this book for school, i would'nt have finished it. This book, altough it has a strong idea for a good book, it doesnt have a climax. I also found it VERY unbelivable. This girl is kidnapped, taken to some unknown place, and writes letters to her parents, friends, police, teachers and also writes a story on a typewriter she had when she was kidnapped. I found it unbelivable because the last thing i would be doing is writing a letter to my teacher while i am trying to stay alive. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE."
5,A book you'll remember,"Reading through the previous reviews here, I find some of the 'cons' expressed ludricrous. It isn't a good book because young readers aren't mature enough for the ending? What about the older ones? And the ending is 'bad' just because things don't turn out right? That's life! And the author chooses to express it, in the most poignant of ways. I *love* this novel; it not only inspires you to be grateful for what you have, but to show your gratitude to those around you. It kicks!"
2,The Girl In The Box,"This story is based on an interesting premise. A young girl is abducted from her home after a fight with her two best friends. Now, she is trapped in a dark room with a small supply of food and water and a typewriter. After her first day of imprisonment, she never sees her abductor. She is left alone, with only memories from the past to dwell upon. I admire any author who can write a chapter book about a girl alone in a room and still keep it borderline interesting. Unfortunately, this book never passes borderline interesting. The author tried to use psychology instead of regular action, but even that failed. Instead of building up to a dramatic climax, the book struggles along and ends with only a small sputter. Having read the book from start to finish, I found myself only wishing that I had chosen another book from the library."
1,A dreadful read,"My 11 year old was forced to read this in the 6th grade. It traumatized her. The book has no point, unless you think the fictional adolescent musings of kidnapped teenage girls are worth your time and effort. I can't believe this book is appropriate for elementary school children. At best, offer it as option reading for older kids, but it was a horrible experience for my daughter.And we wonder why kids don't read for pleasure anymore. . ."
4,"Unique, memorable, even inspiring.","I tracked down this book after coming across several ""I read it when I was a kid and never forgot it"" testimonials. For about the first third of the book, I wasn't sure: the pace dragged a bit, the narrator kept making veiled references to something she hadn't explained yet, and it all seemed pretty contrived.The flashback story accelerates, however, and the present-day story of Jackie's captivity grinds along relentlessly with its suspense over whether she'll live or die, whether that door at the top of the stairs will open.I have never read another book quite like it. I felt inspired at the end by Jackie's questions and the answers she creates for herself, to look at my own life and wonder what kind of a box I might be in, and how I want to respond.Four stars instead of five for characters who seem a younger and less fleshed-out than they're meant to be, and for the slow start. Worth reading, for writers and readers who like big questions."
2,not pleased,"I found this book at the library and thought it sounded pretty cool.But when I began reading this book I found that it seemed to drag on forever and never really revealed much of the plot until near the end of the book.If you could call it the end.I wasnt pleased with this book but I didnt want to stop reading it because I was hoping it would get better.It didnt.About half way through the book you can guess how it ends.I was pretty disapointed and now I'm not sure if I want to read any other books by this author.If I do I hope that they are better than this one.I gave this book two stars because i does have a genral story-line thats pretty decent,but other than that it dosn't rate very high on my ""like"" list of books.If you like odd books that leave you hanging and not knowing what happens,you may like this book.But I dont recomend you buy it.just my opinion."
3,Where is Jackie?,"Jackie McGee has been kidnapped and trapped in a dark room with no windows. However, the thirteen-year-old had a typewriter and paper in her bookbag, so she begins her daily task of typing notes about her situation and pushing them out through a crack in a trap door. She has not seen her abductor since he first pulled her into his filthy van, but he has supplied her with food and water. We are just as ""in the dark"" as she is as to what measures are being pursued to find her. This book does have merit, but the notes do get tedious, and there is no closure, no completion, just no more paper. It needed something else to deserve more......"
2,Needs a sequel,"I just finished the book and was so disappointed at the ending that I had to read all the other reviews. Then an idea came to me. The author should write a sort of sequel from Jackie's parents point of view and tell how they handled the same ordeal and then give us an idea of what the kidnapping was all about and how it ended. That way the story could still have closure without ""Girl in the Box"" having a phony, happy-go-lucky ending. Otherwise the whole story seemed trite and was just an avenue to explore the mind of someone stuck in a horrifying situation."
1,pointless read.,"We read this book in class in 6th grade. Now at 24, I still think it is among the most pointless books I've ever read. it can be summarized as a girl was kidnapped, nothing happened, the end. The writing style was good, its unfortunate that the author chose to waste it on such a poor plot."
4,Very good!,"This was a very good book, now under my favorites. Many reviews have probably told you the summary already.The book gets a little boring, but if you either skip some of the pointless parts or put it down, it turns out okay in the end.The only problem I have is that it has a cut-off ending. I HATE it when people do that. (But that's just me.) Does Jackie die? Does she get rescued? You really don't know, but you can make up endings, I guess.This was a very good book over all."
3,Interesting... 'Vee haff vays of making you read...',"'A Century of Progress' snared me with its cover. How often do you see Adolf Hitler and a dinosaur sharing picture space? (Well, if you're a SciFi/AltHist fan, maybe more than most people, but still...)The premise is simple: In 1984, an aging man, his granddaughter dying of cancer, is approached by a mysterious woman who offers to cure the girl if he will do a bit of work for her and her organization... no more than a day or two, really...The catch is that the job is in 1933, and that the job entails planting 'listening' devices in and around the Chicago World's Fair to pre-empt a Nazi-descended timeline from taking over this Earth as well.Sub-par for Saberhagen, but still a decent read."
1,Johnnie at his Worst,"Please do not judge Johnnie Ray by this CD. This is a terrible retread of some of his greatest songs. This album should be pulled from the shelves as it is an injustice to Johnnie's true talent. The ""Most Requested"" album is the best intro the the greatest singer of the 1950s."
4,Recordings Johnnie did in the 80's!,"""Greatest Songs"" by Johnnie Ray is a fine collection of his biggest hits from the 50's, this collection is different, and interesting to listen to, though, as these recordings were done by Johnnie in the 1980's, his voice is deeper, and every track is in STEREO! Great liner notes by a close friend of Johnnie's describes his life and gives details about who sang at Johnnie's funeral in 1990 and others who were there, great to add to a Johnnie Ray collection, or just to hear how he sounded in his last years."
3,Second Best,"I enjoyed this version of Jonnnie Ray's big hits. I agree with the reviewer who felt that ""The Best of Johnnie Ray"" is better. I feel that his voice in his earlier years was more mellow and smoother. However, he was a great singer and he was still very good in his later years."
1,Johnnie in decline; don't start collecting here!,"These ""re-creations"" of Johnnie's biggest hits were recorded in the early 80s, when his voice was in serious decline. By this time it had acquired a harsh edge, exaggerated by his attempts to reach notes that were increasingly difficult for him to hit. In short, you should instead buy any of several collections of his original Columbia recordings from the '50s - ""High Drama"" would be an excellent place to start."
2,wrong product,"I chose this rating because it is not the book I ordered! I replied earlier through the amazon.com/feedback and got no response that it was not the book I ordered and asked what I should do and I got no response from anyone! I ordered the book that is listed above, but I received Bible Study by Books by the same author. I would still like the book listed above. Please advise!"
3,a bit difficult to read,"I had a difficult time staying involved in the writing. it may have been factually correct, but it wasn't interesting."
3,will take more time than I have,"Good overall review of Paul's life, just will take more time than I'll dedicate to finish. A little boring to read but of average usage (nothing new or unknown from previous readings)"
1,Does not work as advertised!,"The portable keyboard is nice, but for whatever reason the CLIE does not sit well in the slot and it actually ""pops out"" every time I had tried to use it. Only by holding the CLIE (I have a PEG-N760C) hard against the slot, the keyboard works. Same experience with the Targus portable keyboard. So far, the only portable keyboard that has worked as advertised by the manufacturer is the Targus ThumbPad, which is a nice gadget to have but a bit uncomfortable when trying to type fast."
3,It's ok for the price,"The iconcepts keyboard is sometimes better than using a stylus especially if you are using any type of word processing program like Documents to Go or entering new info such as notes of contacts. The one thing about the previous reviewers comment on it not sitting well on the keyboard, is that you must make sure the clip that holds the keyboard together when folded is out of the way. I have gotten error messages and have had to soft reboot my Clie 320. I also would like to see the scroll work on the applications screen. But still, when I'm in a hurry to make some quick notes or work on a short story out in the middle of nowhere this little keyboard is quite faster than a stylus."
2,Cheaper for a good reason,"This keyboard is cheaper than its Sony brand competitor for an excellent reason - it's simply not as good. I'm a fairly good typist, and this was *much* slower than using Graffiti to enter information.You have to poke and push very hard to get the keystrokes to register, and the divided nature of the keyboard makes it very difficult to get up any speed at all. I couldn't type more than a few words without having to go back and add missing or extra letters.I would only recommend this keyboard if you can't cope with Graffiti at all. Entering any large amount of text will simply take you too long and drive you insane with the pointlessness of becoming a two-fingered typist otherwise."
1,A very mediocre basketball game,"I played a couple exhibition games vs. the computer. The graphics aren't very good at all (bad even for a GBC title!). You have to squint to see which team you are. The sound is horrendous, and the AI is either too smart or too dumb. .... Avoid this garbage like the plague."
2,Needs LOTS of help...,"If this is the best basketball there is, Konami needs a bit of help. Very easy, sound sucks, and the players are out-dated. It only deserves 2 stars because it is basketball, and it would be pretty hard to mess up on that...But Konami could do it.-Anonymous"
3,Acceptable quality,"Nice set of drills for the homeowner, but they don't keep an edge long after repeated use in machine shop."
2,Where's the Underwater Footage??,"As an avid shipwreck fan I found this dvd a bit disappointing. I enjoy a bit of history with lots of underwater shots of the ships being discussed. This film had much in the way of history - sort of looked like a powerpoint presentation with history bits flashing on the screen. The biggest disappointment was the lack of underwater shots for each shipwreck. I think there was about 1 minute of underwater footage at most for each shipwreck. If you want just the history, this film is okay although there are other means of gathering more in depth information. If you are looking for a film with lots of underwater footage, you will be very disappointed with this film."
2,Almost really great,"As mentioned by others, the concert is great. The way it was shot with multiple camera angles is great - especially if you want to keep your eyes on Zakir's hands! The editing and 'special' effects are a bit cheesey, but they don't overwhelm the whole video.The reason I'm giving such a low rating is that the second disk's audio is not in sync with the video! That's pretty inexcusable for a live, percussion-centric concert. I may have a defective copy, so I'll contact the manufacturer and report back if that is the case."
4,Worth Buying,"I was at this show at the Fillmore last year and it was a great show, though not as good as their first show at Stern Grove the previous summer. I hope they also release a dvd of that show, until then, get the audio cd. The dvd, is beautifully done, but it also shows that the musicians were a little uncomfortable because it was so damn hot at that show. I remember I was near the stage, and people were crammed like sardines. These guys should be seen at an outdoor venue. Good dvd, overall, though, and the multiangle feature is done wonderfully."
4,Great!,"These juggling balls are great, they don't bounce very much, they have a very good weight to them, they are not very sticky but they are not hallow so some of the balls will make a little noise when you make it and it doesn't affect the performance at all."
2,Not impressed.,"Sorry! I started to read, became very bored and never finished. Two stars for Amazon delivery and quality of book."
3,There are Better albums out there,"While this release by Curb records encompasses quite a large chunk of Hank Jr's career, the sound is less than perfect (to say the least). The CD begins with Hank Jr's copy of his father's classics ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" and ""You Win Again"", then a few of Jr's earlier Nashville Sound numbers ""You Win Again"" and ""Rainin' in My Heart"". While these are fairly representative of his early career, the sound quality is poor, and nothing like the originally released albums which contained these songs. But, then we take a a large jump into the rowdier Hank Jr with such hits as ""Family Tradition"", ""Texas Women"", and ""Dixie On My Mind"". I'm not sure where Curb got their master tapes, but there's a world of difference between the first 7 numbers and the last 13. Personally, I think you'd do better purchsing the original ""Greatest Hits"" CD's that are still available."
5,great honkytonkin album.,"this is another great bocephus album. you just cant go wrong when listening to hank williams jr, are any hank williams for that matter. everyone of these songs are great, i have them all on diffrent albums. still need this one though. but ya"" boy it sure would have been nice to see little bocephus on this one, maybe next time. we'll see. a happy fan."
3,The Alphabet Train,"I will willingly admit that my train-crazy 3 year old loves this video and I love the footage but the disturbingly amateurish voice-over is really enough to make me toss it under the wheels of the 10:15 express. There is another kid's train video which I would heartily recommend -- Choo Choo Trains Up Close and Very Personal ( a whole series of videos with similar titles in fact) which uses most of the same exact footage but does not subject viewers to the stilted and painfully clumsy voice-over of this video. I'm well aware things like this are done on a shoe-string, but don't hire your dad to do the narration where a real actor is required."
2,Non-stop action with the dynamic duo,"If you think a super hero game can never be too fast-pased, this could change your mind. Enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game, constantly trying to take you under. You'd swear you were in Detroit.If you want a slower-paced game based on the animated series, try the SNES version. It doesn't let you play as Robin, but it has more depth and . . . wait a minute!! I'm not reviewing the SNES version!!!As either Batman or Robin, you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killed."
1,A chronicle of lies and official distortions.,"Sendero Luminoso and the Threat of Narcoterrorism is full of all of the lies that were revealed as such years ago. While only helpful as a guide to official disinformation, it is only useful as a study of Cold War dilusions of American academics. Look elsewhere for truthful reporting of Latin American insurgency."
2,scary bunny,I bought this costume as a promo tool for my business. We now refer to it as scary bunny. We had to get football pads to wear under the costume so that the bunny was tall enough. Kids ran frighten. The head kept flopping over. All in all I'm sad because I will have to buy another costume next year
5,Back to the 80's - Without the bad haircuts,This is a very refreshing CD from a nu English duo. It's electronica with 80's sensitivity. Take Air and Groove armada. Add some Depeshe Mode - Vince Clark era - keyboards. Throw in some Neo Romantic sounds. Now you are almost there. The nice thing about the Alpinestars is that the ski theme really works. The art matches the sounds and gives it all a nice Euro-touch. Who said the pet shop boys couldn't have children? Next step should be: Alpinestars learn to sing.
3,Honda mirror,"Fits just fine, wish it came with the beauty cover. Also the little flipper/dimmer thing isn't quite right, it travels a little to far."
4,Great Dresser For Price,"I searched around for a dresser for my baby that wasn't terrible expensive, but was still nice to look at. This dresser is perfect. Nice big drawers, good height and width, and great price. It took a little less than 2 hours to put together. There was a little tiny nick on the paint, but once it was put together, you couldn't see it. We are really happy with the product."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,The dresser is SO cheap!!! Everytime I open a drawer it falls apart. The drawer bottom is made of thick cardboard and buckles under any amount of weight. I am so disappointed. The dresser was not inexpensive and was a total waste of money. I got it for my grandson for Christmas and had to replace it by Valentine's Day. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else!!!
4,Good Value!,"I purchased this since it matched my daugher's crib. Very heavy, and arrived well packaged, with no scratching or damage. A little difficult to put together with one person, taking about an hour and a half. The only concern that I have, is that each of the drawer fronts have popped off at one point, since having clothes put in. We have fixed this, and it has not happened since, but makes me wonder if as the clothes get heavier, it may not hold up as well."
5,This game rules,This is the best basketball game I've ever played. It has cool features like you can create your own players and costumize their stats. Also has a trading mode. And really good Playoff setup.
3,nba 3on3 soso,I got the game last Christmas and the game is not very good. I would say it is for ages 8+ and no younger because they would not understand it. the good thing is I get to be Patrick Ewing and my other favorite players to be on my favorite team the New York Knicks because of trades and they have cool up to date stats. The bad thing is there are graphics that could be better and instead of point games there should be 4 quarter games.
2,this stinks,I think this game needs to be more realistic. you have to score 15 points to win. you should get a time limit of five min. per quarter. They should have more rookies. If It's this bad it should be at a lower price.
3,3 on 3 basketball with kobe brayent,"I got the game this Christmas and is prearty good and bad. I think they should have more then 3 players, should be 4 quarters insted of point games and should have better and more graphics. I would recomend it for ages 8+ because the younger ones would not understand it. But I like that they have all of my favorite players and teams my favorite player is Patrick Ewing and my favorite team are the new york knicks and you are able to trade and there are up to date stats but I think you should be able to trade."
5,Supportive Information,The title of the book prepares the reader for what it contains and it does not disappoint. I found it to be easy reading and most helpful in my loss. I was searching for a little hope and found it as I read this book.
3,Frightening 50's British sci-fi,"I saw this movie when it was released and it scared the hell out of me at the age of 10. Richard Wordsworth's silent terror still scares me. The bleak black and white scenes and loud, shrill string music add to the grim story of a returning astronaut slowly being dissolved and transformed into an alien which entered his spaceship. The complete alien at the end is disappointing but up to that point it's a frightening story of a slow, terrible death."
4,Who was really the monster?,"In this early black and white effort from Hammer, we see a spaceship on its return to Earth. Three men had left on the voyage, but only one is inside when the rocket lands. One man, and a strange, fungus-like residue that may be the remains of the other astronauts.As the poor survivor starts to mutate, we watch lead scientist Brian Donleavy coldly and remorselessly attempt to solve the problem. Perhaps, considering it was the Cold War, we expected characters to be as hard hearted as Quatermass. On watching the movie now, however, you'll find yourself asking the question ""Who was really the monster?"". Was it the poor mutating astronaut, or Quatermass?Donleavy's last line can still send a chill down your back."
2,It works . . . sometimes,I can't decide if this thing is defective or not. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. It seems that it pulls too much juice from the usb port which causes Windows XP to shut it down. Other times I get miscellaneous hot sync failures. I'm going to give it a few more days before returning it to Amazon.
1,"Bad idea, poorly executed.","A depressing story without a point. A painful and stereotypical depiction of life in South Central Los Angeles. Thoroughly amateurish cinematic technique. Makes one wonder how the investors were so completely fleeced into giving the filmmakers money to make this turkey. I know, I was there."
2,Sort of alright,I had problems with the video working properly on this sim. I have a brand new AMD64 bit gaming maching with 512MB of graphics ram. This software is really picky on the video drivers that are supported. Check out the support forums before you buy. You will find a lot of users with video compatability issues. Even on new systems. I wish I would have read the problems that others were having before I bought it. Mine is going up on ebay within the hour.
3,Heroism and evil in the Wars of the Roses,"A decent book on the historical period which took place in England from the reign of Richard II to Richard III. Not as breathtaking as other Costain titles, this nevertheless was entertaining and very thorough in its section on Richard II. Unfortunately, this takes up half the book, and the rest of the Henries and Edward IV and Dickon are given short shrift."
4,fair for the price,"This game is entertaining for fans of cartoonish games like myself. It isn't one of the hardest games but it is fun. If you own a genesis, this game is decent for its price."
2,Snore,"The keepers are ""Culture"" and ""Temperature,"" the rest of Stab The Unstoppable Hero is rather lazy and formulaic power pop, like being beaten about the head by the Sloan catalog. I can't say that this is a bad record -- if you like hooks, you like hooks right? -- but something tells me that Arlo is capable of so much more. Another recruit in the stationary pop army."
5,not tritium,It's not tritium but then again the description doesn't say tritium. My mistake. Other than that it's a great piece of gear!
3,The Saint of Marvin Gardens,"This weird book about a brilliant kid stuck in the weirdest family situation is set, like many contemporary novels, between the old world (the church, an orphanage) and the bright, shiny, new one (Atlantic City). Many authors are using playlands -- Las Vegas for Tim Powers, theme parks for George Saunders -- as metaphors for contemporary society. Thus the bizarre casino land in which Henry is raised, and the makeshift families he moves between, are something he may need to escape from but can't. And Reuss perhaps says this is a good thing. What is this novel saying about gnosticism and faith? And what's that whole zoo thing? Of course, in every novel there's a supreme intelligence hovering over the action -- that of the writer. Here the writer's hand seems to be forcing the action into the form of an allegory. Don't get me wrong; it's an enjoyable read. Do the good guys win? Not necessarily."
3,Might Want To Consider Individual Cups,"I have the silicone baking sheets and love them. Easy clean up. Since I make so many muffins and cupcakes, I was hoping this would be an alternative to buying paper cup inserts (I wanted to be greener). While this product works, what I hated was that it's so flexible that putting it in the oven filled with batter is difficult. It bends and I have to shove it in awkwardly. I tried putting the flex pan inside my metal pan, but it didn't fit quite right.Now, I'm placing it on a cookie sheet. It's fixed the problem, but the product didn't work as well as I would have wanted it, too. I have now purchased the individual baking cups to put into my old muffin tins."
4,Has Worked Well for Me,"I received two of these as a gift. First, the instructions on the package did say to put them on a cookie or baking sheet. I wasn't thrilled to hear that, but it has worked well and I've never had batter get on the sheet so it doesn't add to clean up. I've had no trouble with bad odor whatsoever, the muffins come out of the pan easily and cleanup is SO much better than a metal muffin pan as I can put this in the dishwasher. I definitely prefer this to the silicone muffin cups I have, which don't completely fill up a metal muffin tin."
2,Bring back my metal muffin pan!,"I am so disappointed in this pan. EVERYTHING sticks to it even when I grease the muffin cups. It doesn't burn, so I guess that is a plus, but I don't like leaving 1/2 my muffin in the pan and scraping out muffin bits to serve for breakfast. Trying to clean it is much more difficult because it is so soft. At least with a metal one, you can soak it and then wipe it clean. This pan won't rinse clean and the dishwasher doesn't help. I would definitely recommend you think twice before buying this item."
1,floppy wilton muffin pan,The Wilton Easy Flex muffin pan is way too flexible! It is just plain floppy. You can't even get it into the oven with one hand. It just folds in half. It also has developed a hole so that what ever I put in it leaks out. DO NOT BUY ONE. Evie
2,Rips,The corners of the muffin wells does not stand up - Two of the wells have now developed a hole and after only three uses.
4,muffin pans,My mother had been wanting some of these silicone muffin pans and so I got them for her for Christmas. She is pleased to own them but has not tried them yet.
3,Wilton 6 Cup Muffin Pan,"I was disappointed by this purchase through Amazon. I was expecting the molds to be for the jumbo size not just the standard size. It would have been nice if the description for these molds had been clearer. Normally speaking, regular size molds are sold in a 12 counts and jumbo in 6 counts."
4,"God's diet: A Short & Simple Way to Eat Naturally, Lose Weight, and Live a Healthier Life","The author writes a good, direct book on eating natural foods that are easy to get, prepare and healthy. This diet is easy to follow and makes a lot of sense. I recommend it for anyone who wants a direct, easy guideline for foods that are nutritious, a diet without continually counting calories, probably one that has the simplist guidelines of any that I have encountered, and one that works!"
1,Restoration of All Things,"I guess the author feels that when the Lord Jesus says He came to restore ALL things He left out the original diet given in the garden BEFORE the fall. She states that we should only eat what God made. I wonder if she would use the same philosophy in her food preparation. I don't recall the parts of the Bible where God made frying pans. Amazingly SHE has found God's diet AFTER Dr. Atkins, Barry Sears and the like. She insults the many millions of Hindus, Bhuddists, Seventh Day Adventists, and others with her silly claim to know God's will for the use of HIS creatures. The usual answer to this is that God, throughout the Bible, condones the eating of meat. The point most always missed is that Jesus said He came to restore ALL things. (I take liberty to suggest that this is restoration to 'pre fall' times) A simple check of the first chapter of Genesis will show God's diet!"
3,KW's facts are skewed,"Unfortunately I have not read this particular book, but I have read related books (ie; ""The Hawaii Diet"" and ""What the Bible has to say about Healthy Living""). The principles are sound, but I am particularly responding to KW's comments about ancestral life spans. While true that biblical accounts back the idea of very long life spans for the first several generations, by the time you get into the 500BC area, life spans were much shorter,thanks to disease, wars, and the general breakdown of God's creation, thanks to the curse. By the middle ages, 40 years of age was quite old, and that's a fact which KW must not have bothered to check out."
1,"When did God make Shredded wheat, diet jello, cheddar cheese","One can argue...about God making ""everything""..but I will let that slide.Since when did God make Cheese or diet jello?I understand the concept here...but IMO seems to be another gimmick...particularly when I read the sample menus and read ""cheddar cheese and diet jello"" makes me laugh..salad of diet jell-o with raspberries; Nabisco Shredded Wheat cheddar cheeseno offense...but ""nabisco shredded wheat""...??what is the difference between shredded wheat (okay)and pasta (not okay)silly book..."
2,God's Diet,I just finished reading this book and have to admit I was disapointed. I don't think the information in this book would actually help someone lose weight. sorry.
1,An Erroneous Diagnosis...,"I've only read the review article, and already have a migraine. Her premise is one should only eat foods that grow from the ground or can be killed - i.e., natural vs. human-made. She even excludes alcohol and bread, presumably on the assumption that fermentation (a natural process around long before humans) renders these products as unnatural. Yet, in her sample menus, she advises consuming cheese, butter, and sour cream, all items derived (quite naturally) through fermentation.I'm especially dismayed that with her being a doctor, this contradiction exists at all, let alone in a promotional article. I prescribe a healthy dose of skepticism before taking her advice."
1,God didn't make this diet,"God didn't give man pigs for food. Pigs are the earth's garbage cans, along with shrimp, lobster, and all kinds of food. God didn't make Jello. Gelatin comes from boiling down pig's hoofs, and is not fit for human consumption, not to mention all the artificial coloring.For those who do eat flesh food, keep it clean. Modern ""agriculture"" has bastardized perfectly harmless items formerly known as ""food"". Sometimes this kind of stuff is hard to avoid, and not even 100% practical, but staying away from the obvious garbage is a good step.She bashes wine and bread, and yet in Biblical times that was a perfectly acceptable way to preserve fruit and bread was a common way to serve grains. In the Bible days people were offered loaves of bread as a gesture of friendship. Jesus himself fed thousands of people with barley loaves, and fish.This woman needs to re-write the book totally, after a good browse through the Bible."
3,But what about...?,"What about the unleavened breads the people of the Old Testament ate and the wine they drank?!?Bread is from grain and wine is from grapes...both can be either pick from the earth or pulled from a vine!Moderation is the key in all we do!! Philippians 4:5I DO like the way they ate in OT times...meat with bitter herbs aka. meats with veggies (Exodus 12:8)yes, very low carbs...but they still had unleavened breads and wine with their meals.(Genesis 27:37)"
1,not quite realistic,"I find it absurd to include eating animal meats as part of any diet. Animals are now raised today in warehouses and fed horomones and chemicals, God didnt do that to his creations. Also, in the *old days* we didnt consume pounds of flesh a day as consumers do now, people worked and hunted for thier food! Bread was a part of the daily meals back in the day and to exclude it now doesnt seem quite right, though it partialy makes sence since bread now adays is packed with sugars. If one works a strict vegan life this could work, but not the way she makes it out to be..."
1,Oh Please!!!,"Everything that is on this Earth is edible. Don't drink alcohol or eat pasta? Is this lady crazy? Does she really think Jesus drank grape juice??? God gave us GRAIN to make things like pasta and alcohol! We aren't meant to CHEW its stalk!! I am so tired of these diet fads, and this lady should be ashamed trying to use God to sell her book."
2,Right Track,"Go back to the first foods given us at creation,which involved NO KILLING, and produced healthy lives in the 900+ year range. Flesh foods were only given after the flood in Noah's day. Look it up, experience it! Today animals are very unhealthy to eat-for our health and theirs- and even their products, dairy and eggs. This book leads in the right direction, if we go all the way!"
1,"Bacon, cheese, jello? Was that in the Garden of Eden?","Please give us all a break! If God had intended for us to eat such garbage, it would be growing on trees! Is this book for real or should it be listed under COMEDY? I say, plant a garden and start there. You will eat healthy food and get exercise in the process. What you don't grow, you won't eat! That was God's plan."
5,The food of the Gods?,"I didn't think this book was going to be much help, because I figured ""God's diet"" meant you'd be eating manna from Heaven 3 times a day, 365 days a year, for 40 years. Fortunately, the book's diet is quite a bit more diverse than that.Still, I bet that manna thing would make for a great crash diet sometime."
2,It is what it is.....,"This is a story we all know or have heard I'm sure. A person turns into a crackhead and their daily mission is to find a way to get money or a hustle going on so that they can get that next blast. KInda boring but I gave 2 stars because not only was Don-Don a crackhead, he was a straight up killa."
2,"Revenge, Revenge, Revenge","I'm starting to see a pattern in Moore's books. It's like revenge to the nth degree - you kill one of mine, I'm killing one of yours. I didn't really enjoy this story as much as I did The Apostles or Triple Take and I'm kind of growing tired of the violence, although I understand that's what his books are about. I also didn't find Don to be a believeable character. Maybe because I wasn't sure of the time frame of his downfall or I'm not well-versed in the life cycle of drug addicts. How is this character, who's been smoking crack for the period of time he was smoking, able to function as well as he did for as long as he did? He was on top of his game up until his last hit? Oh, well...get this one from the library."
2,He More Than Slipped......2.5 Stars,"First of all let me start by saying this is my first book by this author,although I liked his writting style this is not one of my fav as far as a good read goes! Although this is a work of Fiction and it could and I'm sure has happened in real life...The majority of the events were just TOO unrealistic for ME! others might enjoy but.... I must say I LOVED the ending I wont give it away but I never would have thought it would have ended that way! I will give this author another try with one of his previously written books because I liked his writting style {and he's from the Chi! Chi-Town stand up!} Do I reccomend this book? hmm Yes as a Library take out or to borrow or if its marked down/free from a book club etc. I donot suggest buying unless u r already a fan of this Authors work!"
3,Vincent Price....shame on you!,"Surprisingly, I did not care for this one much. I usually love my Vincent Price movies like ""Pit and the Pendulum"", ""House of Wax"" & ""Fall of the the House of Usher"". I guess I had a hard time with Vincent Price and the partial nudity thing. The whole thing didn't make much sense. The ending was just as silly as the beginning. Oh, well.....off to the video graveyard!"
3,Good Read,Not a bad book. A little dry at times but ok for a rainy day. If you don't like the sea you won't like this book.
4,Sign me up!,"Not sure I could do the ""around the world"" trip, but lots of good information regarding freighter travel. Definitely want to give it a try."
2,OK for a Diary,"I am considering travel by freighter this year and bought this book to learn the details of this type of travel. There were few details about the ins and outs of the preparation and the book turned out to be a diary of the trip. The one thing that really bothered me was the author's inability to differentiate between ""then"" and ""than"". Seeing ""then"" misused often really grabbed my eye. Maybe it is just because I am a teacher, but it was distracting to me.All in all, it is not a bad book, just not what I was looking for when I ordered it."
1,Buy a better book,"This book isn't the best on the subject and the author seems to be a radical survivalist or at least a Republican. I would recommend Charles Long's How to Survive without a Salary, it is lighter and has better information."
2,Too far removed from reality,"I get the feeling that the writer has never tried some of his suggestions. The ones that he tried, I wouldn't. However, I finally found somebody more frugal than Amy D."
1,living well on practically nothing,this book was terriblei am embarrassed to even have it in my house
3,common sense,"This book has good points if you want to live as a recluse in the woods, have a country club membership and just lost your job, or just need to review basic conservatism when it comes to spending less and living better. I already practice most of the conservative methods Ed brings out (ie buy used stuff, cancel memberships, fix broken things). However, Ed does bring out great tips regarding using epoxy, tooling your own parts, and reminding us that no matter how bad the financial situation, we can somehow find a way to survive. His business tips are iffy at best, and can turn into more headaches than actually money-making ventures during this day and age."
3,Important Lesson for All You Busy-Bodies,"He gets a bit extreme at times, and its mainly for people heading out into the country (he also talks about how to hide undetected on government lands). But it does show how much money we waste and could get by on if we had to. That point itself makes this a good lesson for many people spending all their time making money instead of actually living. Maybe the current economy will teach people to ask: Do I really need 4 cell phones? 300 cable channels? Why do I spend most of my money on a car just to get me to work? etc. Live smarter. Live better. See alsoBetter Off: Flipping the Switch on Technology."
3,Mickey's Racing Adventure - GBC,This game is alright but it's a little to childish for me and there's barely any racing in the game all you do is walk around a lot in the game and collect goofy object's that relate nothing at all to racing the only thing this game relate's to is a lot of older and newer disney character's but hey if you like disney a lot then get this game.
1,Very Difficult,"At first glance this game seems to exciting and fun, but do not be fooled. As a game boy beginner I found it to be very difficult. I could not even open the first level. I am 13 and thought that it was much too difficult for the age group that they recommended. If you are in the mood for a challenge then this is definitely the game for you."
4,The Finish Line!,"This game is challenging. When you are steering, sometimes you have to go backwards. But, who cares? Also, you can use spells for cheats, but you need money for things like that. Even Pluto can go on the courses if you find 9 nuts. Pete's mansion is the hardest race. I recommend this game because there are so many tracks. The graphics are high tech excellence!"
1,Conspiracy theory nonsense,"Very little here of any substantial value: mostly just paranoid conspiracy theory rhetoric. The ""Forbidden Archaeology"" segment was interesting (although, once again, conspiracies are at play here as well.) References were lacking, and many of these essays seemed vague and without any real substance. This is one of those books you flip though, raise your eyebrows and go ""reeeally"" and then turn the page."
4,Conspiracy Nuts?! NOT...An introduction to alternate views.,"If you are already one who questions ALL of what you hear and MOST of what you see then this book is as another commentary stated, ""great bathroom reading"". Stating that ""if"" you have read Brave New World then you already know everything in this book is a little misleading. You Are Being Lied To mostly covers issue which are in front of us NOW which you might not have gotten accurate information from the major news outlets or any information at all if you do like most of the American public: Eat, Sleep, & S**T with a lot of work and T.V. taking up the rest of your time.Powerful interests and ""responsible"" news outlets in order to better shape your thinking and thus public policy limit facts and/or distort the issues of the day. Definitely worth the purchase but as with all things take a grain of salt and check/research beyond this one source.Rating: B"
4,Question Authority!,"Disinfo is one of the best resources available when it comes to alternative views of everything from the mass media to the nature of reality itself. Though some of the articles contain rather speculative statements and opinions, I found this book to contain many enlightening insights into how and why the authorities of certain institutions lie to the public. As a result of buying this book, readers may find themselves digging deeper than the mass-consensus for a long time. This is healthy and comendable, for you have every reason to be paranoid about the govt, corporate america and the mass media. This book does a wonderful job of proving that your paranoia is justified. By the way, I am almost sure that ""alex burns"" (two or three reviews below this one) wrote one of the articles for this book. ""you are being manipulated"". Just thought I should point it out."
1,Very disappointed in this one,"You truly cannot tell a book by its cover, OR its description. Because I have been uncovering the truth for over 25 years, I expected much more out of this book than it delivered. It was extremely disappointing, to say the least. Despite all of the hype involved in promoting it, the book offered no new insights, and made a mockery of uncovering the truth.Some of the material was a bit raw and seamy, and it fed my trash can as quickly as I could get it there. Not one I would recommend for true investigative reading."
5,A Definite Read,"Wow, I felt like I was eating for hours, playing with my food. I didn't know what to eat, but I tasted all options and left feeling bloated. If I'm being lied too, then whom should I trust? And is ""trusting"" a myth? Yeah, I agree, with other reviewers; this is definitely a starting point. You can't believe everything you read. After all, we all lie sometimes and that is the alone truth that I accept.On the contrary, the cynicism alone in this anthology is worthwhile. Some things will definitely make you go ""hmmmm."" It's entertaining and gives you enough material to spark interesting ""convos"" with a group of skeptics and the not so skeptics.I rate it as a definite read."
1,this is not journalism,"I've read about half of this book, and I am furious. While I am all for free speech, it should not be disguised as careful journalism. You can say ""The president said.."". There is no need to write ""The dick president said.."", as I have read in this book.I am not an expert in many fields that are discussed in this book, but am well trained in some areas. The articles in these areas are ludicrous and irresponsible, the cited evidence far fetched (in the best case) but usually just completely stupid. The logic is flawed, the arguments completely one-sided, eveidence to the opposite completely left out.I will not read the rest of this book. I am scared that I might believe information from the chapters that is similarly wrong as what I have read.The book really conforms to its title."
2,Would not recommend...,"I am split between the pros and cons of this product.Pros- A lot less of a mess-Can dilute medicineCons- Can't tell if she gets all of the meds, meds get coated around base-Is surprised by fluid everytime and chokes-REJECTS her pacifer for the rest of the day!The last con sucks. My daughter is 4 1/2 months now, and gets very upset with this. I think it is easier to just give her meds through a dropper and deal with the mess!"
3,Oriental flavor fun,I have finally seen an Oriental unicorn in action! A Ki-Rin. Pretty typical anime fare but it does have an intriguing storyline. =)
4,My son loves this,"I ordered this for my son because he remembers his dreams each morning. He's taken it very seriously and loves having something special to write in every day. Even though he got plenty of toys, this was one of his favorite birthday gifts.I do have to mention that mine looked nothing like the picture here. It is blue with an inset in the front for the pen to attach via an elastic band. The elastic band broke two days in. I think I can fix it with some hot glue."
4,HAY THIS IS PRITTY GOOD!,"Turok 2 was actualy a good game. That Australian kid waswrong! This is actualy a good game, as far as Gameboy goes... Thegame bites at first but it gets better. The bullets may look like balls but so what? It is the game that counts. I have played alot of Gameboy games an seen a few that are worth getting, and this is one of them."
2,"Good graphics, gameplay not so good","This game looks really good at first, with the high res opening credits and options. But when you actually atart the game it is pretty pathetic. There is a wide selection os weopons however thay all shoot the same stupid grey balls for bullets! Big fat grey balls for bullets? The gameplay can be good sometimes but the game is so repetetive. The new turok game sounds a lot better so i suggest that you but that instead if you had your heart set on turok."
5,Eileen's BAD,"This album is the first I heard of Eileen.I was blown away.She brings Celtic to a whole new place.Her use of various colors is extraordinary,especially in the case of percussion.She is a fine soloist.She's firey! Her Irish roots come through and it's so perfectly mixed with good old American soul!She hits you with one thing after another.Nothing stays the same.You go away from this with a great feeling!"
4,"2 books very good, 1 very bad","THE BLUE SWORD and THE HERO AND THE CROWN are wonderful books, they kept me glued to the pages, the stories are original and compelling, the heroines are interesting and charming. I liked the best THE HERO AND THE CROWN.SPINDLE'S END is another story: It is a super modified version of The Sleeping Beauty, the narration was a chatterbox, too many unnecesary and annoying descriptions, too many unrelated comments in the middle of the narration, too unfocused, it deviates too much from the story. Besides once the princess was living with the fairies nothing happened, nooooothing happened, it was tedious and boring. In addition, the male counterpart was as charming as my shoe, there was no developing of the relationship at all. I would advise to buy the first books separated, and to do not buy SPINDLE'S END."
2,LIKE I RUN A MAFIA YOU KNOW...,"I hadn't realized this was a TV episode when I watched the film. This movie was part of a ""Man Cave"" 8 pack. I managed to pick up the needed background information during the feature. What made this film different was the 18 year old mafia ""valley girl"" leader who was reckless and funny taking over the family business. When she wasn't on the screen, or the fiery red head, the movie was pretty much of a bust.The couldn't have sex and nudity so the give us some cleavage, a peep show, and a girl on a trampoline. Victoria Pratt plays the 18 year old mafia leader who looks closer to 30 than 18 by the wrinkles around her eyes.The whole premise that the government has some secret intelligence force and uses Mission Impossible type gadgets to go after organized crime is inane. Normally they have someone on the payroll acting as a double agent in order to get information.Not worth the view unless you are into the characters who happen to be on the lame side."
1,Big Disappointment,"I received this DVD as a gift. I like John Woo's work, so I thought this would be a good film. The tag line is ""they only stop to unload."" After 35 minutes with very little action or plot development and listening to wooden characters echo poorly written lines (""I feel like the last living cell in a human body"" ""If it helps, I'm sorry""/""Well, it doesn't help"" / ""Well, I'm still sorry."") I turned it off."
2,"If you have zero Java experience, this book is not for you..","I recently also bit, and made the mistake of purchasing this title. This was motivated by my frustration with the incredible lask of practically ANY titles on the subject of Java Game Programming. There is something akin to less than 10 total titles printed on the subject in the last 10 years. The writers C and C++ background shine through here (which quickly becomes a significant annoyance, due to the profuse C and C++ ""Comment boxes""). This would be wonderful, except for the fact that this book is supposed to be on JAVA. More time could have been spent on validating the included code examples for things like basic java standards complience, as well as actual compilable code. Many of the code examples will require significant re-writes for anyone running JDK 1.4, even though the book claims to have been written while the 1.4 spec was standard. Without a previous Java base to draw from, this book would have been practically useless to me."
1,So many typos!!!!,"I am really pissed about this book. I waited for it for two months and when it finally came it had five useless beginner chapters and a bunch of basic applet crap. The worst thing about it is that it looks like it was proof read by a child and a careless one at that. The example code on the cd seems fine, but the printed text is missing the last character or two on every line in some examples. Ironically it occurs in an example called ""A complete example"". I am sorry, but this is just unacceptable!!! Code Sample From book:public String toString(//return a verbose description of attributreturn attribute + "": "" + getPointsAllocated()I think this is supposed to be a method, but who can really tell?I want my money back Tom you lazy no proof reading bastard!!!"
2,To bad...,"Unfortunately, this book suffers from the same problem as many other Java books on a specific subject. The author believed it necessary to explain what Java is in the first 8 chapters, instead of assuming some previous knowledge on the subject (there are plenty of better books out there on beginning Java). Game programming is an indepth field, and unfortunately is not covered in-depth in this book. There are many in-depth books for C, C++ on the subject, but as of yet, none to count for in Java. There are a few games published using Java out there, eg: Vampire:The Maquerade, Roboforge, etc. Maybe the developers for those game should write a book, as of now it's still a neech market."
5,"What a lovely, inspirational book!","I was so happy to find this book at a recent conference. The quotes it contains made me feel proud that I am following a vegetarian lifestyle. And I am in such good company! Einstein, da Vinci, Pythagoras, Alice Walker, Kevin Nealon, and so many more...I will be giving this book as a gift to all of my vegetarian friends, and also to the people in my life who are moving towards a more compassionate way of life."
1,Bearly concealed contempt for fathers - not on my bookshelf!,"I almost bought this book for my 6-year-old son, but started flipping through the pages, and I'm glad I did. In the story, although Papa is supposed to take the lead in improving his son's report card, he is portrayed as a bumbling idiot who is incapable of performing his role, and who requires and receives stern direction from Mama Bear.Look at the cover - Papa Bear is shown frowning at the report card as if he can barely read it!This book plays into the common, trite stereotype that fathers in the household are unnecessary buffoons who can expect at best to be tolerated, but never respected.If you think I'm overreacting, read the book, imagine the story with the gender roles reversed, and then imagine the ensuing outcry if a publisher dared to print such a version."
3,"Good songs, could have more","It's quite a short DVD, and I think it could have had more songs (more of his hits with Jimmy Gonzales and Mazz) but I'm guessing he probably didn't perform them because of copyright or separation from Mazz. Whatever the case, it has some old favorites - it's basic in format, nothing spectacular - in fact it's like I could have just set up a tripod with my own camcorder and recorded this. I'm not 100% satisfied with the ""value"" of it, because I think it could have gone for about $10 rather than the $18 I paid for it."
4,Good replacement,"Was looking to replace the lid on an old steel 8"" sauce pans. One of the old pan's lid's plastic hand broke and couldn't be replaced or fixed as the screw holding the handle on broke, so a new lid was in order. Shopped around and this is the best replacement that was not glass so it would match with the other pans in the set.The handle doesn't transfer as much heat from the lid, but they are still warm to the touch. They wont burn your hand but children may be uncomfortable with them if used to help keep contents warm for serving."
4,It's a nice lid,"It is what it is advertised to be - a lid for an 8"" skillet. It fits my 8"" skillet perfectly. About the only exception I take with this item's description is where it says ""Riveted handle with high arch stays comfortably cool on the stovetop"". I do need to use a pot holder to remove the lid if I have been cooking something for a period of time. It cleans up well and looks new after about six weeks of use."
1,Disappointed,The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise.
2,Highly Over-rated but a Good Guide to Singlish,"Having read several raving reviews about this novel, I'd expected far more of it. Being an expat, previously in the Netherlands and now in Singapore, I expected to identify much more with some of the issues raised.This book was somewhat of a struggle to get through - but was a good guide to Singlish (""Singapore English"") 101. Other than that I found it fairly plain reading and as deep as the Singapore river (ie, not at all)."
1,Cant be used on windows vista or windows 7,the product arrived but didn't worked because it can't be used on windows 7. I was really dissapointed because I payed shipment to Mexico.
1,VERY Disappointing,"With fifty years of TV behind it, this is the best TV Guide could do? A compilation of Christmas cartoons that are on every year. Frosty the Snowman, Charlie Brown's Christmas, Grinch, Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, etc. Where are the clips from the classic variety shows? Not here. Mine went into the garbage can after one viewing it was that bad. I gave it one star for quality. ZERO stars for content."
5,"Oh, Yeah!","Inexpensive cable and works perfectly! I did some research on cables before buying. I can't find an HDMI cable locally for less than $15. But I read on the CNET site that they themselves have bought these inexpensive cables on Amazon and use them in their work with no problems whatsoever, so I thought if it'll work for them testing electronic equipment all day, it'll surely work for me. And it does. I bought to hook my Roku up to my smart tv and it works great! Very pleased!"
2,Good if you hook up once,"This is a very thin cable. It works fine, and would be okay if set up once in a home situation. However, I used it with laptop for mobile presentations. Too many winding and unwinding and the thin cable broke, or shorted, inside. Lasted just over a month. If you're going to be winding tightly to transport, or have to plug and unplug often, look to get a thicker (28 awg) cable."
1,Don't get fooled by the awesome box!,"Oh BOY is this game awful! When reading the box, I thought this would be very fun because you get to create your very own golfing environment. But not only is it extremely, extremely hard to get a 4 or 5 star resort rating within the money you have to spend, I keep putting gopher control buildings and the golfers keep complaining. They're worth $2,000 each. They also complain about being bored, hungry, and tired and have to wait too long for teeing. I keep satisfying them, they keep complaining. And the golfing: I can't explain how boring it is to actually golf on this game. The characters [stinks] and the way of golfing [stinks] too!! The store I bought this from told me I couldn't return this game once I opened it, but I tried to, and boy am I glad they somehow took it. Trust me, don't buy this game. Everything about it is boring and rediculously horrible!!"
3,Where is the manual?,The game would have a higher ranking from me; but the lack of a manual makes the course design learning curve too high. I can't understand why they would have a 'documentation' option on the CD and have it be a WORD doccument of the exact same fan-fold piece of junk they included in the box.The game is well done and fun. Just be prepared for a long learning curve when you start designing courses. The built-in tutorials seem to have a bug too and stop advancing and giving messages. I built the object they asked for but the game didn't notice it and wouldn't continue (twice in the exact same spot.) This increases the frustration from the lack of a manual.
1,Worst Tycoon Ever!,This game is terrible. There is no way to know how to make your guests happy. The AI is moronic. Guests will walk a mile to the bathroom even if one is right next to them. This will create new problems. The worst part is that even if your guests hate your golf course you will have a five star resort and win the game easily. It's greatest sin is that this game is just not fun.
4,An Excellent Primer on Indian Policy,"I happened upon this book by pure coincidence but have since come to rely upon it as an essential reference source on the history of federal and state policy towards dealing with tribes, tribal governments and tribal members. A really well written and interesting read, not too academic or technical, and does justice to the experience of Native Americans while maintaining a remarkable objectivity uncommon to most histories on this topic. Very useful to put contemporary Indian policy issues into a larger historical context, in my case, in representing state government interactions with Arizona tribes. A good read for interested non-government amateurs as well."
3,Textbook-Chief Red Fox Is Dead,"This is my fourth semester buying used textbooks from Amazon. I have learned that it is better to buy the cheapest book that is in my state. The cheapest, because although it may have some writing in it, for the price that is easy to ignore. It will have all it's pages since I don't think a bookseller would send one that didn't; word would get around and that vendor would have no more customers. And in my state because the shipping costs are less since the textbooks are shipped from the seller. If you can find more than one textbook from the same vendor, even better. Overall, this textbook was as indicated and for $2.00 was a bargain."
3,Great!!,The book had a little highlighting in it but it was cheap and it got the job done which is what I care about!!!!
5,Awesome!,"This album is amazing. The group makes a ""rythm"" section with their voices throughout. Very entertaining."
5,Beautiful Christmas music,"I, also, have not purchased this CD set as it is not available!! :( However, I have heard several selections on my internet radio station and I love every song that has been played. I would love it if it became available, again!"
4,stovepipe reducer,"Item is ok....a little loose fitting on the 9 inch side but, that could be my other pipe's problem too, so not sure.reasonable price, would use same company if needing more similar items."
5,great anime,"Came with a cool soul eater sticker, the shows nice but watching it online will tell you if you should buy it or not"
3,Mostly a trivia game...,"This game for the GBA is not a real entertaining game and is kindof weird. You chase around flying demons, squash bugs, and then answer trivia questions. The trivia is a good test of your knowledge but, the gameplay is not that fun."
2,The Bible Game review,"I thought this game was for small children, but it's a little more difficult than expected. I also didn't care for the spiders and scorpions. Most children are afraid of these things and don't consider it much fun to play a game with these in it. I like the concept of defeating the enemy and learning scripture, I just don't care how you go about it."
4,Bible game,"I gave this game as a gift to my son and he seems to enjoy it. It is different from the Xbox game of the same title, which is nice."
5,Writing Conversation,This book is excellent for teachers wanting to know more about how to have effective converstaions with their students during reading conferences. This will change how you approach conversations about writing with your students.
5,Excellent! A must for the winter months!,I really use & love this product! It is easy to clean! There ia nothing as good as fresh citrus juice in the winter!
2,I found this game to be dissapointing!,"Let me start that I am a HHUUGGE fan of the Gargoyles TV show. The story was absolutely thought-provoking and the animation was stunning and the characters showed so much depth like nothing disney had done before.Unfortunately this game seemed more like a cash-in on the whole franchise becuase the whole game was just shoddily put together and the controls were lousy.The graphics were rather unimpressive even by 1995-1997 standards and Goliath the character you play looked rather awkward. The controls were rather awkward and made it hard, not to mention unenjoyable to play.A very dissapointing game considering how much of a HUGE fan I am of the cartoon series. Even radical Gargoyles zealots should pass this game by."
2,Some nice things Some not so nice,All but the basket and cups where thrown out due to musty taste. Mugs where beautiful and basket was great for garden tools in the garage. No a recommended purchase though.
4,Toys for experienced woodworkers,"Very useful and comprehensive information. Very nice samples but you need more than basic tools to built these. I have a nice range of tools but still I need more to do all these. Overall, It is an inspiring book and a must have book if you are into making wooden toys."
4,Good Place to Start,This book will give you plans to work with. Next you can put your personal touches on it.
4,Hoo Yah,"This movie is a great overview of seals history and missions. For those who are interested in Seals but don't know a lot about then i recommend it. If you already know a lot about the Seals I wouldn't strongly recommend it because it does not go into extreme detail. Overall it is very cool, very well done, and a good film for for all seal wannabes."
5,NINJAS RULE! 9.75 OUT OF 10,"This game was one of the best games ever made for the Genesis, not to mention one of the greatest games ever created. This game has really cool level designs and the missions are awesome to play through. Joe Musashi has a number of attacks and platforming moves up his sleeves which makes the action all the more sweeter. You never know what he might be doing next on another level like the level in which he battles ninjas via surfboard. If you liked Ninja Gaiden you'll probably love this amazing retro ninja classic. The graphics are nice and crisp, the enemies are pretty cool, the gameplay is still awesome, the character designs and level designs are awesome, and it is an experience unlike anything else you've played. The only problem is the game at times feels too easy, but that's never a problem during this wild adventure."
5,Excellent DVD art-program!!!,"The new icons, user interface, design center, and galleries make it easy enough for anyone to use. Also the new features are a snap-enhance my favorite pictures with the improved Photo Workshop. It's fun to make Ballons to your pictures!!! I could add a little fun to my family pictures with balloons."
2,a letdown after v10,"This was very disappointing. I don't use PM myself but have helped a friend with it. She bought v12 mostly in order to get some fresh graphics. V12 has far fewer than v10. Read the fine print on the v12 box: most of the images are available only on the web. So when you search for images in the clipart catalog, many of the categories are completely empty. The images that do exist are not of good quality.A good feature seemed to be that for the first time, projects made in earlier versions could be imported into the project catalog. However, it turned out that most of them lost their links with the pictures used, so although the catalog showed them, the actual projects couldn't be used. If you like an earlier version of PM, my advice is to stay with the version you have."
3,"""Back in the Fifties again""","I first read this book in the early 1950's, checked out from the High School reading room. I purchased it in 2005 for my Grandson to read and have a bit of understanding of high school football in the 1940's and 50's. Kind of ""hokey"" for adult reading, but great for a youngster.The story is about 4 high school buddies that played in the same backfield for their high school football team. The school dissolved and the 4 boys were assigned to different schools, where they all excelled in football and each of the teams played one another, and..............(read the book, its enjoyable)."
5,"Hello, I am an addict. Yes, I am addicted to this fruit","Hello, my nme is S*** and I am an addict. I have been clean three hours...because I ate them all and NEED MORE !!!!I cannot get enough of this product. I only have one complaint. The bags are too small !!!!!Please send more...now...as in today... I'll wait. Right here... pleaseeeeeeeee :)"
1,"IT IS NOT GOOD , VERY BAD TASTE !",I WAS BUYING THIS THINKING OF REAL DRIED FRUIT BUT IT WAS NOT !!!& IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CANDY OR CHIPSTHAT WAS AWFUL SNACK FOR ME & WASTE OF MONEY
5,To clear things up...,"Just to make sure it is known, Living Stereo records directly into DSD and makes no conversion from PCM. All editing is done in DSD. Therefore, there is no ""24 bit mastering."""
5,badass,"this cd is a real good down to earth cd. when you listen to this cd you hear blues and rock put together. i like robert frith because he is from my home town and he has played at two parties that my neighborhood had, and he is a real nice guy."
4,french complete course cassett tapes,"Found the tapes and coursebook extreamly helpful. I understood and remembered words and phrases in a short period of time. Pronounciation was clear, pauses between were just right to practice. The dictionary is an added bonus. Only down side was tape player ate it-- so am ordering replacement set! More ""daily living"" converstion would be helpful."
2,Full of repetition of same things again and again,"This book is not much about how to fast. This is more about why to fast. And it will tell you hundreds of times why to fast. It will tell you to use apple cider vinegar an equal number of times. It is so much repetitive that I had to put the book down every time I read more than 40 pages at a stretch.No doubt, it has some very good pieces of information. But that information needs to be extracted from the book. With its very big font, it becomes very annoying to read similar sentences presenting more or less the same ideas again and again. I think it would be a much better book if the matter put into over 250 pages is presented in about 75 pages.It is impressive that Mr. Brag has treated many people.... but this book is full of bragging about how he treated people. And the treatment of same person is mentioned several times. It becomes irritating after a while."
1,Bragg likes to brag!,"The book repeats itself constantly, some of the material is outdated or just plain wrong, and it focuses a lot on what a fabulous physical specimen Paul Bragg was. After doing a little research, I found that he died at 81 and not the 96 that his followers tout. My mother died at 89, and still had a box of ""little debbies"" in the pantry. I think the basic ideas of the book are common sense, and could have been said in a 10 page book."
1,This model no longer supported by Belkin,Belkin does not support this model any longer - it isn't even listed on their support website. I've had mine for several years and recently bought two new LaCie d2 Quadra drives - it works with all my older equipment (even two older drives of the same make and model) but will not recognize the new drives. I've narrowed the problem down to the hub but there are no firmware updates available and no troubleshooting advice in Belkin's knowledgebase.
1,Windows 7,"I purchased the 6-Port Hub, and tried it on my HP computer, with Windows 7. No luck! Contacted Belkin Service and they informed me that drivers for windows 7, are not available and are not expected to be available in the forseeable future.Has anyone been successful in finding a firewire hub that will work with Windows 7?"
1,Be very very careful!!!,"I guess I should have read the reviews here, more carefully. I have a Mac Mini that I'm using as the hub for my home net: it is attached to the TV and it hosts a huge RAID drive. I thought it would be perfect to use for iChats with the parents, using an old firewire iSight camera I have lying around. Since the RAID is firewire and there's only one firewire port, no joy. When I saw this little device, I jumped on it.Not only did it not get the iSight working, but, while attached, it appears to have corrupted the RAID drive including 20 years of music and video (all legal, thank you very much). Bummer dude. There are comments, elsewhere, here, about ""hub compatibility"" etc, which probably explain the issue. Whatever. ... and it might work perfectly in some applications. Having it kill my hard drive, though, with no warning, gets it one star. I just wish there were a way to assign it about -2."
3,underpowered,"While it basically functions as it should, the hub seems to be slightly underpowered. I have just three devices plugged into it (two self-powered hard drives, and a Digi Mbox2Pro bus-powered audio interface), and it doesn't always recognize both drives. Also, sometime when I eject & turn off one of the drives, the audio interface disappears as well. As long as I don't change anything (i.e. turn off any drives), it works well."
2,Fine for Awhile,"The Belkin was a replacement for an older Belkin of the same model that I thought had gone belly-up. This new ""improved"" version worked fine but only for about a month, then it went completely dead. I tried the old one to see if it would work until a new one I ordered had arrived and it works find WITHOUT the power transformer. I am using the old one now and keeping the new one as a replacement if this one decides to quit also."
4,Firewire 400 Hub,"There are very few on the market, and after a few months this has worked fine. I have had no problems connecting external drives or iSight camera.It gets only 4 stars since I have had to exchange Belkin USB hubs under their lifetime warranty after a year or so, and I am concerned that this itemwill remain problem free."
4,Second one works like a charm,The first hub I received turned off my computer when I plugged it in. The second one works fine.
2,broke after about 2 years,"It worked ok for about 2 years. Then one day, it just stopped working. Two years was just too short I think. So I give two stars. I won't buy this again."
2,kind of works,"Locks up my intel mac pro running snow leopard instantly every time it is plugged in or out. Wedged hard such that the machine is not even reachable by network for a clean restart. Must be hard reset by power-off. Save all documents, and be prepared for instant death when you bring this unit anywhere near your computer.If you enjoy living dangerously and are planning to install this on a mac, be sure to shutdown your machine first, plug in the device, then reboot. Given that, it seems to work.Also, comes packaged in the worst kind of blister pack that requires great care to open without tremendous risk to life and limb.If there were any viable alternative, I would investigate it seriously. Have to say, while the details may differ, this is pretty typical of the level of quality delivered by anything I have gotten from Belkin in many years.I'll give it two stars because, if you are desperate, and very, very careful, it can be made to work, and you may still have all your fingers."
4,Belkin FireWire 6-Port Hub...works for me,Pros: this product has worked great for me...no complaintsCons: I would like to see it be powered by the computer rather than having an external power supply needed.I would recommend this product.
4,"Works fine, light as a feather","I write this review only because the negative reviews almost made me not buy the Belkin FireWire Hub. Alas, the options for such a devise are few and far between and unless you want to order something (instead of picking it up at the store) you have even fewer choices.So, reluctantly, I picked this up and LO! on my Intel MacBook it was 100% plug and play. No software, no freezing, nothing but sweet FireWire action.At this very moment I have a LaCie DVD Firewire drive, SeaGate 300GB Firewire drive, MOTU 8Pre Firewire Interface and a Canon DV Recorder all plugged in with one more port to spare. I was having trouble daisy chaining all of them before and so far (a few hours) everything has been running great. If I have any trouble I'll update this review.My only critique is that the hub is so small and light weight it sort of need to be pinned down, otherwise it'll go where ever the wires take it. Just FYI."
3,Careful what you wish for,"I bought both the 7-port USB hub and the 6-port Firewire hub to work with my iBook. Needed more ports. No problem with the USB hub. I attached the Firewire hub, then attached my new Iomega external hard drive, and had a near-disaster which took me a full day to recover from. Turns out my new hard drive is not supposed to be plugged into a hub. No warning from Belkin about that possibility, and a warning from Iomega deep in the CD that came with the drive. So, MAKE SURE YOUR COMPONENTS ARE HUB-COMPATIBLE. That's the little lesson I learned."
3,Noisy for firewire audio interfaces,"The device works as advertised but is better suited for hard drives than audio interfaces. The audio never cut out, but the noise level probably increased 300-500%. Even without playback and the volume quite low there is an obvious hissing sound. It sounds almost exactly like playing an audio tape. There were no other devices on the hub except a Presonus Firebox. I tried several ports and several cables to no avail.I'm giving it 3/5 stars because I had intended to use it for Firewire audio + Firewire hard drive with my Mac mini. But I'm sure it's great with firewire drives."
4,Seems to work,"Not bad- seemed to link up all of my firewire items. My computer crashed once, but I think it's for a different reason."
5,Perfect!,"This is the perfect addition to my new iMac. It allows several firewire products to be used with ease.It is for firewire 400, so an adopter is needed if it is used with firewire 800."
2,Balky & Disappointing,"This thing is just plain old buggy.I had an older Belkin Firewire hub which worked perfectly for about 6 or 7 years, so when it started acting up, I cheerfully replaced it without reservation, with this new model.It works fine with my hard drives, but consistently makes me disconnect and reconnect a digital camera that I plug into it. I never had that problem with the previous hub. I thought the problem might be a faulty wire so I have tried several different ones with the same spotty results.Additionally, some months later, my imac developed start up, and restart problems. The machine would not start or restart. I discovered that unplugging the hub from the mac allowed normal restarts, after which, I could plug in the hub and use it. That seems to have ironed itself out although I have no idea why."
5,Happy to find it.,"After searching every store in my area, I went to Amazon. I can't believe such a useful tool isn't in stores, but Amazon came through. Belkin's FireWire hub is a real blessing."
1,Don't buy Maytag MFI2568AES only lasted under 5 years!,My Maytag Model MFI2568AES did not last 5 years. I was just told after several repair visits and multiple part changes that my unit is beyond repair. The repair person found the copper used on the unit deteriorated and leakage into the system caused the unit to seize. I bought Maytag because of the quality it is suppose to consist of but this is my first and last for this company or any Whirlpool products. Kenmore is my next choice of replacement.
3,Could be better,"It seems to me that they could have made this one piece and it would have been better. As it is, the mop handle is loose in the hands, the actual mop has to be snapped onto the end of the handle and the bucket needs to be snapped into the bottom of her foot. It's plastic, rather cheaply made, and just feels like its overpriced for what it is.This would have been an awesome thing to have if it were once piece and a little more were put into it. Most of her clothes are simply painted on, that is, there is no texture to them. I probably would advise against buying this in favor of better options out there."
4,Meh,"I Threw and a little Grew... Planted during monsoon in arizona, ever scraped it into the dirt. Did not explode into a great green food plot but some grew. 4 stars because i expected more for the price."
1,piece of junk,"THis item broke after about a month of usage. The plastic piece which allows you to adjust the charger to your unit doesn't slide very well and now refuses to adjust. Moreover, the radio signal isn't strong, and the adjustable 'neck' isn't very adjustable, so if you have your cigarette lighter in a difficult spot in your car (like in our 2007 Nissan Sentra), the thing has to basically ride on the floor. This was not our best purchase, and recommend buying it only if you can see the item in person prior to purchase to ensure it fits your needs."
4,Continued Good Music by Sawyer Brown,"This is the kind of music you just want to put on your headphones, grab a beer and listen. Treat Her Right should be a standard played by traveling DJ's at all weddings for the Bride & Groom dance."
2,BAD TITLE; MEDIOCRE MOVIE,"I haven't figured out the title for this movie, but it wouldnt matter. This made for tv movie from 1996 is a tepid character study with little action to make it entertaining.I will credit Bill Campbell (ENOUGH, THE 4400) and Poppy Montgomery (WITHOUT A TRACE) for attempting to bring some substance into their roles; considering the weak script, they do a good job, although Poppy's character is unlikeable through most of the film. Campbell is sincere and makes us feel some empathy for him. The movie is based on a short story and obviously padded to flll its time slot, and is recommended only for true scifi fans."
1,Solid Rip Off,"It was an ok movie,I would give it zero stars if I could,as I hate liers,This is a near total ripoff of a 1930s.40s radio sci-fi show."
1,Cold Equations,"Very Disappointing! The original story by Tom Godwin was one that haunts the reader forever. I read it many years ago as a young teen. When in college, a professor presented the class with a booklet he asked us to read and discuss. When I read the first sentence ""He was not alone"", I flipped the booklet over. When asked by the professor why I wasn't reading I replied: ""I've read it"". He smiled and said ""I understand"".The DVD version changes the focus of the story from the internal struggle of the pilot to one of rebellion against the ""Evil Corporation"". This was not the thrust of the original story. While the general storyline was loosely kept, the DVD lacks the tension and ghostly quality of the original opus by Mr. Godwin. I do not recommend the DVD. Seek out an anthology and read the short story instead."
4,Timothy's Great Coffee,"This is a great tasting, strong coffee that we enjoy best in the early morning.If you're looking for something to really wake you up, this is the one."
5,Our Choice Among Several Dozens Tried,"When we started up our new Keurig Brewer, we tried over 40 different coffeesover several months and recorded our overall preferences on a scale of 1 to5. Each coffee was rated several times. The overall winner was Timothy'sExtra Bold Parisian Nights coffee, and now we seldom drink any other."
4,Good Flavor,"This flavor has a bold coffee taste. I gave this flavor only four stars because it has a SLIGHT kick after-taste. Not necessarily bitter, but a bite."
4,A hidden gem with addictive gameplay,"Being a longtime Sega fan, when I heard about this game originally being released in Japan I wasn't that upset. I for one hadn't a idea what this game was truly about until one faithful day as I walked past it at my job and recognized the title. I checked the back of the box and realize it was a RTS something I had been wanting to play for awhile, and at [item price]what did I have to lose. Well to my surprise this has become one of the coolest games I have ever played. Not being a hardcore RTS player the control scheme is very easy to pick up ( be warned there is no instruction manual with this game ) It has a decent storyline and addictive gameplay. I do wish it had been released for the Dreamcast but I can still play this online with my friends so its ok. If you have an extra [item price]this is a game worth a serious look."
4,AN ACTION RTS,"Hundred swords is a rts with action being more of the focus than collecting resorces its only 2 resorces to collect and it pretty easy to do that. my only complaint is controling troops it very difficult for example if click on a place far away the troops don't take the best route or the accessable route you have to hold shift and lead them by clicking the way you want them to go now that my complaints is out the way lets talk about this game strenghts troop production is very quick the graphic a awasome and the story is intresting keeping you play for more. there are 3 types of troops (calvary, infitry, and archers) and each has and advantage and disavantage against each other. this is an easy game to learn considering it does not have an instruction manual and worth the purchase I would recomend this to fan of this style of game play and give it 4 stars."
3,Overpriced,"Awesome film stock, but ridiculously overpriced.I just saw the price at B&H; ($4) and I feel a bit cheated."
2,Didn't work so well,Bought it to use a modern laptop (read: super glossy screen finish) outdoors on playing fields. Even when generally pointed away from the sun this didn't do much good. I think I need a hood like the NFL refs have.... So if your use model is the same as mine I would not recommend this. The only solution is a laptop with matte finish screen or something else...
3,This is not an IBM adapter,"Please realize that in spite of the name, this adapter has nothing to do with IBM. If you read the text closely, and look at an enlarged version of the image you will realize that.The powersupply is suitable for an IBM R40 (and presumably for a whole range of other laptops too). It produces 15-17 Volts according to the label (The IBM R40 requires 16V DC).It is a cheaply executed device, with flimsy wires. If you need something that stands up to the rigours of travel, you might consider an original IBM replacement adapter, or something else a little more sturdy."
2,IBM 02K6496 Equivalent AC Adapter,"No problem with the item. Problem was that one hour after placing the order, I tried to cancel it but was told it was already being shipped. I believe the source could have accomadated my cancellation but I will keep it and live with the experience."
3,hardly worth the money,"This book is ok, but frankly I expected more for the $60+ I paid for it. There is nothing in the book that you can't find on line if you dig a little. The original retail was only $29.95. Some listings I have see say the original retail was $599! So buyer beware...ok for the avid collector."
4,This bible is a good reference tool.,"If you have caught the slot car bug, this book should be a must have to get you up to speed. It has a nice selection of track designs that span across all current track manufactures(There is also a chapter for those wanting to create permanent tracks).You can tell Robert Schleicher has been active in the hobby since the beginning. His descriptions and writing style are easy to understand. As well as up to date.He goes into custom modification of tracks, and is appropriately detailed without boring you into a coma.The only ding that I can give the book is it's frequent use of black and white photographs. The book uses heavy, quality paper throughout. All color pictures would have been nice.Good book. Well worth the price"
4,A Lovely Box for Photos...or?,"Unbelievably, but true, I purchased this box on Amazon on June 4 for under $12, including super saver shipping and the 4 for 3 promotion. It presents much better in person than in the picture. The deep cherry wood goes well with the silver plate trim. The outer dimensions are: 13 "" high at highest point, 11 "" high otherwise, 8 "" wide, and 6 "" deep. The interior dimensions are 7"" high, 4 and 7/8"" wide, and 5 "" deep. The reason for the interior dimensions is that one could decide to use this box for jewelry. There could be sufficient thickness in the top of the box to permit brass screw-in hooks for necklaces. Otherwise, it still could store boxed jewelry. This was intended for photos, however, and there are three cherry/black felt booklets with plastic sleeves that will store a total of 120 pictures up to 4 x 6 size."
3,"High nostalgia value, but there's room for improvement","This is a good collection of Donny Osmond material, including some of his duets with Marie. A lot of music for the money. Much of it doesn't hold up after all this time, though; the early stuff just sounds silly, with elevator music string sections and back-up singers to match. There are some photos on the CD liner notes that are ridiculously blurry; surely with all the pictures that exist of Donny, they could have found a couple that were in focus! The order of songs also leaves something to be desired, namely chronological order, so there are some jarring transitions from a song with Donny's high, sweet early teen voice to his deeper, grown-up voice and back."
5,Donny Osmond Review,"What can I say about this album except great. I have played the album at three if not four times since I bought it. Donny was and still is the greatest singer around and, has improved over the years. There are some songs on there that I have not heard before, and love them all especially Puppy Love which I simply adore, I only have to hear that song and I am suddenly transported back to 1972 and am once again eight years old. All the songs bring back such good memories for me from when I first listened to them and now being able to listen to them once again only without the scratches on the vinyl record. There are certain songs I play over and over again like Puppy Love, A Million To One as they are such great songs - it is hard to believe that Donny Osmond is now a grandfather of two. I recommend that any Donny Osmond fan buys this album, well worth the money.Laura Lambert"
4,He was a little bit Rock n' Roll,"Actually that is a stretch, but this Hits collection is a decent collection of Donny O's career. What is worth noting is Osmond's changing voice from track 1 to 25. He sounds like a kid in the beginning, then does his best Peter Brady effort in the middle, then to a mature adult in the end. Despite this...still a good effort. His duets with Marie stand out the most. Their remake (a lot of the songs were remakes) of Deep Purple is a favorite along with Morning Side of the Mountain.He never was ""Rock n' Roll"", but was and is entertaining."
5,My first love,Donny Osmond will always be my first love! I love all these songs! They bring back memories of many hours of listening to his music. You can also catch him singing with Marie in some of these songs. The Osmonds were my role models growing up. I even named my daughter Marie.Great cd for any Donny Osmond fan!
5,Great Book,We are very happy with our purchase it is a great book and is just what we were looking for
4,Great Game,This is a wonderful game. The children and adults love playing it. Purchased as a gift for a 7 year old.
3,"Good, but not too great","As a family-friendly title for the Xbox, I can't say the Bible Game doesn't get the job done.Multiple mini-games and a Christian-based soundtrack round-out what would otherwise be a perfect Wii-port. It's not a great game by a long shot, but anyone who's looking for a simultaneous 4-player game that's setup like a gameshow, you can't go wrong with the Bible Game."
5,Great Game Buy it now,Love this Game. Hope to see more like it. picked up a copy for a friend and he loves it too.
2,"Hmmm, I don't know about this game","I just played this game for the 1st time and I must say, I was disappointed. It could have been okay except for the fact that I was the only one that landed on the Wrath of God 3x's! The computerized players didn't land on it once, but I landed on it 3x's??!! I know that it is not all about winning, but how could it possibly be fun if I am the only one to get my points wiped out 3x's. I will give it another try, but needless to say I am quite underwhelmed with this game the 1st go around."
5,Christian Fun game,"The Bible is one of those games that are not being recognized by many, but this game is captivating. It is fun and you learn about certain stories or people from the bible. I would recommend this game for anyone that wants a family game for them and their children. Now, for us that owns the Xbox 360 as well, we need the bible game for it as well with the graphics."
1,Game doesn't work on New XBOX systems,"The shipper did their job and got the game to me quickly. I was very excited to use this game to relate to my Sunday School class (4th and 5th graders). Bought a new 4GB XBOX. Put in the game and it said I needed an external hard drive. Called around and was told I had to upgrade the XBOX to the 250 GB model - did it, and still the game doesn't work. Apparently this game only works on the original XBOX system :-( I am very disappointed and hope ""they"" will update it soon to work on the current systems."
1,Irreverent,"If you are looking for a game that teaches Biblical facts,this is not it. The music is current CCM.Makes light of the Wrath of God. This is not a good game for anyone who takes God serious. If you are worldly this is for you. This is a waste of money."
1,This game is a joke....,"Im to lazy to get up and goto church, why would i waste money on this? its boring, its stupid and if your a grown man playing this, your clearly have issues"
3,Thanksgiving Tea Pot,"Nice Thanksgiving themed tea pot - a little expensive for the relatively small size, but it is the first Thanksgiving tea pot I found that didn't have some large, garish cartoon like turkey on it."
1,Deceptive description with picture,"The description with the picture for this product was shown to be 2000mg-100 Softgels. It should read 1000mg-100 Softgels. It was delivered 5 days after the promised date, due to the fact it just happen to get ""out of stock"" after I paid for it. I have received a full refund."
1,Not what I expected,"The dough kept getting stuck in the cookie cutters - even when i dipped them in flour. Since they are solid on one side you can't push the dough out so it's a real pain. The cookies expanded in the oven, the parts still fit together but looked nothing like the image on the package. Transferring the cookies from the table to the pan was also a precarious thing since picking them up and moving them would cause them to stretch/ deform or even break. I will probably never use them again."
2,Disappointing,"This product was very disappointing. First, there was a cutter missing from the box and had to be sent to us (I will give credit to the customer service department though. They were very nice and helpful). Second the actual cutters were not easy to use. The dough was difficult to release from the cutters- even though they were floured thoroughly. Third, the cookies break easily. Luckily my wife made 2 batches because many cookies broke while frosting them. When it came time to assemble the pieces, again the pieces seemed fragile and easily broke. We never were able to have a complete gorilla as all the legs broke in half. We wanted these for my son's birthday cake as a topper and the pieces that didn't break looked nice, but the hassle was not worth it."
3,a challenge,These cookie cutters were a bit difficult for kids. It was hard getting them to stand on the stands.
1,Unreadable,"I downloaded the sample and I am so glad I did. The print is very poor, like a bad scan or something. Definitely needs to be fixed."
2,Ultimate Paintball 3,This game has bad graphics wich take fun out of the game if it had better graphics it would be more fun.
4,Stargate fans should like this game,"Being the only Stargate video game available at this time, it is actually pretty fun. You play as Colonel Jack O'Neill in this side-scrolling adventure. The game stays close enough to the story of the movie, but at the same time, it's not really anything that has to do with the movie. The characters are there, but the storyline of the movie isn't really in this game. You will occasionally run into characters, like Daniel, and talk to them but it's basically your typical Genesis action game. Overall fun, but I only recommend it to Stargate fans."
1,Almost as bad as the movie,Acclaim is notorious for making poor movie-to-game translations and this just proves it. How they were able to make a game as unplayable as this boggles the mind. But I'll give them some credit; they didn't have much to work with since the movie was pretty awful.
5,Grab this one if you can,"Of all of Burgess' books, this is the one I recommend to anyone with intelligence and a sense of humor; I considered him the greatest living writer in the english language during his tenure here, and have read -- and collected -- most of his output.This is the one he should be judged by and remembered for. If all you've ever heard of was ""Clockwork Orange"", take a chance on this winner of a novel."
3,One of the best first lines ever,"It has been almost twenty years since I first read this novel. Two things stand out. One, the story emblazoned in my mind the power of the principle of unintended outcomes, especially the evil results of good deeds. And second, it has an opening sentence that I have remembered to this day: ""It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me."" Still makes me laugh after all this time."
3,"Good hat, not quite low profile.",It is about 1/4in too tall. The front of it is trucker style so it does not have a fitted look.
4,Excellent quality,"I just bought this ""big boy"" bed for my 2 year old son. It was very easy to assemble with just a screwdriver and the included wrench. The finish is top quality and matched his very expensive crib set. Only complaint is that the rails for the bed are too low for his thick, expensive crib mattress (sealys) so I had to use the thin cheap one that I got free when I first purchased the crib =(My son just loves his new bed!"
3,Not Very Sturdy,"We bought this ""big girl bed"" for our daughter when she turned two because she kept climbing out of her crib. It's a very pretty bed (we have the cherry color) and the side rails are just high enough with the mattress. It has the wooden slats to keep the mattress up and those are the cheap part of the bed. They break very easily. I would lean on the bed (I'm 5'2, 105 lbs) and break them without putting all of my weight. My very petite two year old jumped on the bed once and broke more of the slats. We have had to buy replacement wood several times in order to keep using the bed, which is very frustrating. We had hoped to use it for our son when he is older but that is not going to be able to happen."
4,Great album for the all time fan,"What an album with a great list of songs. From ""One Bad Apple"" to ""I Can't Live A Dream"". If you are an Osmond fan or were one back in the early and mid 70's, this is for you. Since The Osmonds didn't release any of their earlier albums on CD, this does help all of us who wanted to hear ""Down By The Lazy River"" without scratches and hear it digital. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the production of some of the songs isn't that great on it. It's like they turned up the mids and bottom end of the EQ on the later songs on the album. However, it is a great album and fun to listen to. Especially if your a musician and they are or were you first musical influences like they were for me. Jay rocks on drums and Merrill's voice rocks. Can't ask for more."
1,Just what I wanted at the right price,Looked around till I saw this on Amazon. What a great price! Got it in a few days took the two adhesive pads and it was fixed. Been on now for months and I have not had any problems.
3,O.K. for the price; only ten bucks g ahead and buy it.,"Gamespy apparently doesn't support this game, so take it to a LAN party. But don't get 'bugged' if they play Battlefield 1942 all night, because it is much better.In Razor Unit, you just run around shooting. It can be tricky at times, because it's hard to tell where they're shooting from. I didn't notice any bugs but I never played it without the patch. I have a P4 2.4GHZ with a GeForce 4 440. Seems to be compatible with everything. But nobody is ever onlne to play multiplayer."
4,Not a bad game like other review state if you go to lans,This game is not as bad as the other review say.I think its got alot of potentional.The game is rather boring alone but if you go to lan parties its a good game.They are also working on patches for this game to fix bugs.I think they released it to early.But the graphics arent bad they are desent.I enjoy game but i also go to alot of lan parties. So if you go to lans buy this.The AI does [isn't good].
4,"""Cool"" Chili Pepper bandana realy works!","I wear mine for physical therapy sessions, onece I forgot it was was VERY uncomfortable. I'm hooked on these, have given some to friends."
2,Allright but disappointed,I bought this game after reading the reviews and thought cool this is the best sega game. It is kinda fun but it takes an hour to get to level six. I wish you could start at a level like six instead of starting back at the begining. It needs a memory card or something. To long to play. If you know a way of starting the game other than at the starting level let me know
5,its a amazing game,I have this game my whole life my dad gave me this game with the sega genesis when i was four and I am still playing the crap out of this game just yesterday me my friend was playing two players on this game. I beging to think this game might be funner than most of my xbox360 games.If you like classic genesis saga games this game is for you. If you buy this game it is worth it.
5,IT'S STILL A CLASSIC 9 OUT OF 10,"Sonic's glory may have disintegrated in the wake of his crappy 3D games the would follow in later years, but his Sega Genesis adventures are still among gaming's most classic memories. Aside from trying to stop Dr. Eggman, there isn't much story to be located in here. It's all about speed, running through obstacles and to defeat enemies in this surprisingly challenging game. The biggest flaw of the game is the camera. The camera sometimes can't seem to catch up to you when you run at incredibly fast speeds which unfortunately will cause some cheap deaths. Other than that this game is awesome, and is something any gamer should own because it's still a classic. If you own a Genesis you better have this game."
5,One of the funnest but hardest games of the mario era,Here are condesne speed run static doctor robotnotic total boss endurane is 18 precent for the firt three fights the player had invulerability shield on for the first fight. Total boss damage resintance include metal sonic all the robontic robnotic and the laser cannon is about 86 percent more or less depending on what attack patterns you use if you know the weak spots when the proper time to attack is. For the final fight boss hit the robot on its button the jump and aim for the vchest and neck area for the second half do this correctly you should not take any damage even though he is swat and punching at you during the battle..
5,Awsome Sonic Game,Out of all the sonic games this is the best. Sure the new games have 3D graphics and the characters acutally talk but you can't turn into super sonic at will.Only on certian levels (usually the last levels). Also the special stages are fun (unlike the ones in Sonic Heroes).
4,Sonic 2,"The best game ever! Over 16 million copies sold! This was my favourite game (and still is) Not as hard as Sonic 1, hooray. Its worth it to see cute Tails copying Sonic's every move!"
5,PELLADVD'S = Best seller's on Amazon!,PellaDVD's Shipped this in 3 days.This was purchased for a friend of mine.The game was 100% working and my friend beat the game the night he got it!Thank you so much Amazon and PellaDVD's for supplying me this! :D
4,Kiddy Game,"This is more of a kiddy game because of its graphics from Sega. I played it so much that my eyes get dizzy following Sonic throughout the scene. Although, I think everyone should take dizzy pills because of how fast he is running. I know if you look down at his shoes, you will get dizzy."
4,"STILL ONE OF THE BEST,SEGA DESTROYS","Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is absolutely a worthwhile gaming experience. This game has it all killer gameplay,replay value,great controls,graphics,sound,awesome and crazy levels with high speed. In 2003 its hard to find a game this good these days with a few exceptions (Halo,Halo 2,Doom III) but besides a few titles the new games just don't impress me,so they have better graphics but where is the gameplay and such. Anyways back to the review Sonic The Hedgehog 2 can appeal to almost anyone young to old. Also checkout SONIC CD FOR SEGA CD it is by far the best Sonic game and Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is second in my opinion."
4,almost as good as the 1st,"sonic 2 is not as good as sonic 1, but that doesn't it's bad. on the conterary, it's still AWSOME!it had more speed, multiplayer, better graphics, and super sonic.the special stages are cool, but can be frustrating without a game genie. there are sonic 1 or 2 places where you get stuck in the enviorment. when you get all the emeralds and 50 rings in a level, becomming super sonic isn't a choice. but that doesn't slow this game down.if you want a game to have fun with by yourself or with freinds, sonic 2 is the one for you."
5,Better then the first!!,"Putting tails in the game was perfect! The game was great! And the zones were too! The music was perfect, though I think all the sonic music in games and movies is great! I'd buy this game!"
4,Really good book,This book to me has a lot of details and that is what I like in a book I give it a 4-star!!!
5,Every bit as good as the first one,"The second book in the series, this book takes the same event in history but looks at it through the eyes of those on the opposite side of the Civil War. Again, I felt like I was learning things that were interesting - nothing like learning about the war in school! The author is so good at helping us see all sides of this issue in a page turning way. Never wanted it to end, but I was anxious to discover all the answers to my questions at the same time. I love how she inserts her beliefs in a way that is easy to understand while not feeling forced into the story. I had to buy book three immediately upon finishing this one!"
5,great book,"I have read this book twice. It is very very good. The story involves two young women. One seeks work as a nurse, in order to impress a minister in the hopes that he will marry her. The other young woman goes off to war, dressed in men's clothing. The story is fascinating. Very good book. A great read."
4,really quite Good Nicole A D,I think this book was pretty good I just wished that there was more about julia and james in the ending than there is. and i wish that nathaniel didn't kiss her at all. Pheobe is prettygood to.nathaniell I have to definatly wonder if he's saved at all. But all in all I think this book is very good.
2,Unbelievable,"Trying to find redeeming qualities about this book, I found the case studies were the most interesting. The rest of the book I found to be dry and unrealistic. At times, the advice sounds a lot like how to climb administrative ladders instead of how to manage.The final straw for me came in the Crisis Management chapter. Mosley advises, ""A mid-toned pullover style of shirt or sweater, some durable cotton slacks or jeans, socks, and exercise shoes are the perfect attire for the well-dressed middle manager during a crisis.""Oh Puhleeze!Looking at the publication date, I think this came out before hurricane Katrina or the Indian Ocean tsunami and a few other disasters since 2004. I hope Mosley is well and has survived any disasters; I imagine she would have different advice for us now in the aftermath of those terrible tragedies.Overall, I found the rest of the advice to be equally worthless throughout the entire book. Definitely wrapped too tight to be real. Sorry, but both thumbs down."
2,Missing items!!!!! .\ /.,"It said a pack of 6, but I only found 3 in the box. then I tried to look for their seller contact info, none."
2,not what you think,"If you have brought other books by this author you will know how great they are, but this is a disappointment. it is not a jewellery freferance book but a book of quotes."
1,Not really a healthy cookbook,"Although the title of this book says ""Healthy Cooking for One"" it is neither! There is no nutrition information and the only reference to reducing fat or salt is a tip that says you can substitute lower fat products in the recipes. There are dip recipes claiming to serve 1 that use an entire package of cream cheese. Not healthy and not a single serving. The black and white photos are not inspiring and the recipes are so simple that they would only be interesting to very new cooks. I was very disappointed in this book and do not intend to even add it to my library. Sorry, but this is a waste of trees."
1,Don't waste your money,This cookbook was a TOTAL waste of money. The recipes were so simple that a young child could do better without a cookbook.
4,another stupid review,I ordered this book for my wireless kindle the book came through in good working order The book had how to cook a hot dog
1,Sorely disappointed,"The topic of the book excited me. The actual book completely disappointed me. To begin with, there are many grammatical and typing errors. The recipes are dull and uninspiring, using the same ingredients over and over. While seeing recipes for plantains was interesting, that section is way too long. The black and white photos are fuzzy. There is too much white space on every page and in between recipes. I look at cookbooks to inspire me. This one turned me off. I am returning it. I am sorry, Ms. Hills. Better luck next time."
3,"Fun, but many errors","The overall idea of a DBZ RPG is good, and the system posited here works pretty well. However, the rules listed in this book are full of contradictions and many things are left unexplained. Currently, the book is most useful as a reference to the English version of DBZ as it gives info on all the characters (major and minor) in the Saiyan Saga (which is before trip to Namek). The game itself needs some work, so don't buy this if you expect to learn it quickly. Your best bet is to wait for the Frieza Saga book coming out soon, which hopefully will have rules errata for the main game (or maybe rewrite the whole thing)."
5,Awesome,Worrking on a campaign at the moment. It helps explain some of the reasoning for why some things in the show happened the way they did. It also provides some insight on some of the things the show deosn't touch very much on.
3,Almost perfect but lacking some crucial thought,"This book has the some of the best ideas and concepts from the hit TV show Dragonball Z. However, the procedures for gaining experience points and spending them on your character to make him better is not well thought out. Skills, Hit Points, and Power all cost the same amount of experience to increase, and the book doesn't give a cost for increasing other attributes of the character at all. This game also uses the watered down version (Instant Fuzion) of a generic system (Complete Fuzion) and so experienced role-players will want to download the pdf file that contains the complete fuzion rules since the Instant Fuzion is fast, but so unrealistic that it detracts even from the Dragonball Z universe."
2,Not Much Music for the Money,"The Dukes of Dixiland - great music of course! But I had barely put it on the CD player than I had to change it, and only then realized that I was only getting 19 minutes of Dixieland for the money. Since most of my CD's go to 45 minutes or more, I felt a bit short-changed."
1,Lousy recording,"I know this group and they always produce good quality, high fidelity recordings.This one apparently is a pirate copy so bad the music sounds like it was recorded inside a large coat closet."
3,This book will collect dust on my book shelf,"It is comprehensive in it's text but there were not enough pictures to suit my taste. The text was not arranged in a fashion that makes it an easier reference. It would be helpful if there where cross references on subjects such as soil. It is a pretty book and I'll keep it but I'll keep looking for a book with photos of all the plants discussed and stat tables on each plant for easy reference on zones, soil,etc.."
2,disappointed or duped,"I did not receive the Enigma Eau De Parfum spray that is showcased in the photo. I believe I was sent either an Enigma cologne spray or toilette spray because the square bottle was more than 1.95 ounce. Also, it doesn't keep its fragrance for any length of time thru the day. I am very disappointed."
4,Underground Classic,"No pun intended, this short (144-page) journey through funeral homes, cemeteries, and crematoriums with side trips to probate lawyers, casket-makers, astrologers, and stone-cutters (among others) is truly an underground classic and a MUST-READ for baby-boomers. Once you start talking about it, you will be surprised how many of your contemporaries have read it. Matson doesn't have all the answers, but he raises thought-provoking questions about dying (and what happens next) in a manner which will bring a smile to your face while enlightening you about things you never thought about, much less knew--although you will quickly sense that you DO need to think about them and DO need to know about them."
4,highly comprehensive bio,"at times a dense read, this provides detail about rothko's life starting from his family's origins. once you wade through to the art, this book is a extremely interesting story about an extremely interesting man."
5,YIKES ITS 700 PAGES LONG !!!!,I wasnt that interested in his childhood..its the adult fired from brooklyn college unable to sell many paintings id like to know more about!!!!However this is the book to read if you want to know the facts of his life.
2,more than I want to know,"This book is choke full of information and instructions. But I found the approach of the writer to be disorganied and tedious. Some chapters were too brief. This book assumes much more than basic sewing skills. You would need experience in creative sewing to use this book. I am an advanced seamtress and probably could have found useful things here, but I preferred to find something else. I returned the book after looking it over."
2,Its not very good,You get to fly around in a ship that often runs out of fuel and the enemys beat you most of the time its almost impossible to get passed level 3
2,Bad Manner to send a cd,The book delayed a lot and the cd included in this book was attached onto the cover with a glue hard to remove. The act of remove the cd causes damage in the book cover and the glue remaining bind the internal pages.
5,Touchstone Book 2,"The book is very good. Many texts, listening and writing activities. Several people's everyday situations.I recommend it for students or for those wanting to learn a little of the English language (for foreigners)."
2,The Gang's Not Here,"Sometimes you can't go home again. Producer Hal Roach's attempt to revive the ""Our Gang"" formula (with the help of original director Robert F. McGowan) doesn't work - mainly because the new kids are so unmemorable. Shot in Cinecolor, the low-budget ""Who Killed Doc Robbin"" (1948) has the presence of George Zucco but not much else. Few laughs and no chills in this painfully familiar haunted-house comedy. You're better off watching Spanky and Alfalfa in ""Spooky Hooky"" (1936)."
3,"Can understand about two words: F---, and well, f---.","And the Magic ""F"" Word is laid on most generously. I bought this because we are fans on Maury Chaykin, as well as the rest of the Nero Wolfe gang, and the story sounds interesting. The film is probably better than we think, and probably great for Canadians. It was lost on us because we turned it off after about 30 minutes of trying to figure out What! They! Were! Saying! Except for the Magic ""F"" Word."
4,warms up,"Warms up during use, so I don't know if this is one of those batteries that lead to harm along the way. Otherwise, Im happy with it."
2,defective toy,"The order was delivered promptly the price was fair, but the item was defective it did not work at all. The return process also was easy and I did get a prompt return of my money."
3,not too thrilled,This is a very clumsy toy. The moves are very jerky and it scared my son more than entertained him. It also only does a couple movements and sings one song so it doesn't hold my son's attention at all.
4,cute,i think this toy is hilarious. both my 2 yr old and 4 yr old love it. it is not to be tossed around.
3,Sure isn't a singing Elmo,"We ordered this item for our son as he always was entertained by the tickle me Elmo type dolls. Knowing the ""spider man"" type toys were more ""manly"" we bought this one for him for christmas instead. What we got was something that costs the same as an elmo doll but nowhere near the use. First off the moving arms don't reset themselves (this is something the manufacturer even knows as they slip extra instructions in on how to manually reset them) so when he's done he looks like his arms are broke cause they point backwards. There are only 2 songs he sings and they're very short just lasting less than a minute. Other than swinging arms there is no other movement. And not to mention the worst part yet- the singing is done by what sounds like a 5 year old kid which sounds really weird looking at Spider man. My opinon- buy the elmo for the same price!THIS TOY NO LONGER WORKS AT ALL- A TERRIBLE BUY, should be used more as a decoration"
1,Not working (again)!!!,"We just got a replacement for the first itsy bitsy spiderman that we bought. Because I have now read reviews on this toy we did not even let our 2 year old touch it, we told him that this was a dancing toy that needed mom and dad to work it. He was thrilled to have it back. It has now been less than 48 hours and we are faced with the same issues. The arms work only occasionally (we did notice that now the company includes directions on how to reset the arms if they malfunction) we have to reset the arms after every 3rd or 4th song. And now our 2 year old starts screaming when the toy makes this awful clicking sound in the middle of the songs, he is petrified of this toy. My son is not afraid of loud, noisy toys as he has an older brother that has some really loud toys but this toys sounds awful.The concept of this toy is so cute, I am sad that the quality is not what we expected."
4,My Nephew Loves This,"I purchased Itsy Bitsy Spider Man for my 15 month old nephew for Christmas, and he loves it. It is easy for him to operate, so he plays Spidey's songs and dances along over and over. I highly recommend it and give it four stars only because it would be cooler if there were more than two songs. Overall, a great toy for toddler boys."
4,My son loves it!,My three year old son accidently found this item under my bed where I was hiding it until I had a chance to wrap it. He was in love with it and I had to hide it again so he would wait until Christmas morning He wanted to open it right away.I like the catchy tunes he sings. Cute toy.
1,Huge Disappointment,"My children received this for their birthdays recently. In less than 24 hours, the arms were no longer moving along with the song. We also are dealing with the loud clicking noises.It's a bit too much to ask that a child place this toy ""correctly"" so it does not damage the arms.We got the Bouncing Tigger at the same time - much better toy!"
1,tedious...,"I just could not comprehend why many music lovers love Bartok--his music might be intellectual, but to me it's boring!"
5,great game,"great game! it's an rpg. If You've ever played god of war, its a lot like it except ur in a team. there are a lot of boss battles, in some u need to push buttons at the right time, theres a lot of crazy powers, there are some puzzles but not much and their easy"
3,MUA,"Love the gameplay, but, I experience problems with loading and the game reseting my PSP 2000 during loading times. The game would have 5 stars if not for this technical problem with the game. All other games work fine on my PSP. I can't get past a specific level because of this problem."
5,why is this priced so high?,"great game, but why does amazon think people will pay this much, when you can get it for 19.99 everywhere else?"
4,Silly fun for young viewers,The characters (all played by child actors) are fun and capture the attention of preschool thru school age children. Great songs and silly situations that tell the classic story are a delight to all.
4,She loved it!,"gave this to my baby for christmas, she loved it! thanks!If I were a more openly excitable person I'd give 5 stars so don't feel bad about 4, the product is cute, and worth the price to see my baby smile :]"
3,decent fighting game,"Eternal Champions is a decent fighting game with original characters. The graphics, sound, control, and fun factor are average, but not the worst I've ever heard or seen. Eternal Champions was one of the first fighting games I played for the Sega Genesis and I liked it for awhile until I played it a lot, then it just got old. The characters are like no others you'll see in any fighting game and have some cool moves. There are lightning fast moves and even some strange ones such as a wizard that throws snakes at you. All in all, it's a decent fighting game and at least deserves a rent."
1,Ridiculous Game,"This game is the worst fighting game ever. You have to press start to change from punch to kick, the players are original, but just damn dumb, and the game is hard. You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person. The graphics are ok, but it's horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game, and you can't even change your character if you loose, so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change characters."
4,A Good Book,"The book is simple and good, giving the best lines and most important analysis of the major openings. There are almost no words in the entire book! A nice navigation tool for chess opening theory, useful to players from the level of intermediate to advanced."
5,Amazing!,"Great, easy to follow recipes. Wonderful full-color photographs of methods and finished products. Easy to use, for chefs of all skill levels. Superb book, for beginner to expert."
5,Very happy,I was very pleased with the quick response to my email and the delivery of my product I would order again without question.
3,Not That Great,"I put this game into my sega genesis recently and I still don't like it. Some parts in this game are hard to understand what to do. They don't give you clear instructions in my opinion. You have to figure it out on your own. Some kids would probably like this game. It's an OK game, but definately not the best on the sega genesis."
1,a real stinker!!,"besides getting the well-known names and facts wrong in the ripper portion, thor has taken pieces of what appear to be his interests (sherlock holmes,mickey spillane, cloning and conspiracies-a la robin cook), mixed them together and come up with a real mess of a book. don't waste your money."
4,+ 1/2 stars...The Last Roundup from Reprise,"When Dwight Yoakam's tenure at Reprise came to an end, they took the opportunity to round up individual tracks from various tibute and soundtrack albums (along with one then new track ""Louisville"") to cobble together this album. While not as essential as 2003's DWIGHT'S USED RECORDS, this is an indispensible addition for anyone who appreciates Yoakam's gift for interpreting other artists' songsThe highlight is his mournful take on Merle Haggard's ""Holding Things Together."" But Yoakam is up to the challenge of covering everything from Elvis's rockabilly ""Mystery Train"" to the swing of Bob Wills' ""New San Antonio Rose,"" the yodelling ""Cowboy Call"" to the Grateful Dead's ""Truckin'.""And after hearing Yoakam perform with Earl and Randy Scruggs on ""Borrowed Love"" and his take on Bill Monroe's ""Rocky Road Blues,"" I'm ready for Yoakam to release an all bluegrass album. [Running Time - 36:10] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Jon as Related to Joseph and this CD,"Jonathan portrayed the part of Joseph in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" and did a fabulous job. As my little sister was in the chorus, I got to hear everything Mr. Pierce did in shows and rehearsal. After hearing his performance opening night, I went online to Amazon to see if I could hear previews to this CD. I must say that I was amazed, to say the least. This man has a powerful voice and he puts it to good use."
3,All and all a good book,"I thought this was a good book. Obviously that guy Frank who rated it has some serious issues about pararescue jumpers, maybe he washed out of the course and is a little bitter? Don't be mad frank, it's an 80% wash out rate. The book focuses on Jack Brehm, because he is the author, and can only tell the stories from his perspectives. Granted it's kind of slow, but this isn't a Science Fiction book, it's a Military History book, so it's not going to read like a Star Wars book. I work around and with these guys, and they are heroes and I think frank might change his mind if he ever had to be rescued by one."
2,SLOW AND LAME,"WHAT A DISSAPPOINTMENT. WITH THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD, I HOPED BREHMS BOOK WOULD BE DECENT. IT WAS ANYTHING BUT. A TEDIOUS SLOW READ I POSED THE QUESTION TO MYSELF, ""WHY AM I READING THIS?"""
4,"For the Price, It's hard to beat","I am what most would call a beginning cross stitcher but I brought this book because I wanted to look at folk art and traditional cross stitch patterns. The book is not a book on how to do cross stitch, there are several volumes out there on that topic which are fantastic. This book is not a how to guide, it is a book with over 100 old fashioned folk art designs. They are all printed in black and white and could be used for anything from cross stitch to needle point or ever as knitting patterns. The designs range from mythical beasts to elaborate boarders. I would have liked to have seen more ideas on how to use the patterns included in the book, but for the price, it's a hard volume to beat."
4,"Always an Elvis Impersonator, Never an Elvis","Or, ""this Elvising is hard work.""Every small townprobably has a Lock and Load Motel on its outskirts. A haven forprostitution, drugs and unwary travelers who are looking for a cheap night's sleep. In Helen Chappell's mystery Giving Up the Ghost it also comes complete with the corpse of one minor mafioso, a superannuated doper ex-prom queen and a whole clutch of Elvis impersonators (or Elvii as Uncle Albie calls them).Forget about the mystery it's not that important, just sit back and enjoy a great ride with Hollis Ball, her dead ex-husband, Sam, and all the other denizens of Watertown, living and dead."
2,rushed,"the story didn't develop very well, was kind of dull and wasn't as funny as the other ones. the plot was rushed(I'm not talking about the amount of time it took to write it)."
3,Fun yet confusing,Although i never got passed level 2 the amount of weapons you have are nice and they have a nice way to allow you to chose what one you want.
3,"Roxana, I wanted more from you!","Although well written, this story of an ""ordinary"" woman became rather dull. Roxana had many gifts, yet in my opinion she never reached her full potential. Roxana's power struggle with her mother in law and her relationship with husband and her children were described, yet I never felt any real depth or passion. Perhaps the author was trying to show the detachment that Roxana felt from others as she suffered from severe depression, but the result was that I felt rather detached from Roxana as a character. I didn't find her insightful or interesting. I wanted Roxana to question her husband's affair, have some kind of meaningful conversation with her mother in law, have some friends over for tea, make a quilt--do something-- instead of meandering through life in such a passive way. I thought the writing was at times beautiful, but I wanted more from Roxana."
3,Unexceptional,"I did not like this book as well as most of the other reviewers did. They have more or less accurately described the plot - the book is the reminiscing of a 90-plus year old woman who has lived her entire life in North Carolina. The problem with the book, for me, is that for the first 60% of the book, she has little to say, and very little interesting happens to her. I did not find any noteworthy insights coming from her statements or observations, just a dry recitation of not-very-interesting facts and events. The last 40% is better; I finally got to feel as though I was listening to a flesh-and-blood person and hearing some of her more intimate and perceptive ideas. But considering how many outstanding books there are out there in the world that I haven't read yet, I don't think this one was the best use of my reading time."
2,Overall under-developed.,"To me 'Out of Hand' contained a storyline that had potential it didn't reach. For starters, there is no real gay or homoerotic action between the boys. Pretty much what you see in the trailer and in the pictures on the DVD box, is all you get. There is abundant female nudity and very breif male backside nudity.As for storyline, I call it underdeveloped. The boys becoming friends is awfully abrupt. The ending is also abrupt. Situations like Paul's mother being very poor and sick or even Sebastion's little crush on Paul seem like they will be important and expanded upon, but aren't.The movie can be slightly disturbing and explicit sexually (just not between the boys). I'll leave it at that.All in all, I purchased this film because it was advertised as a man/man love story, which it was not. Setting that aside, I felt the storyline had a lot it could have expanded on, but didn't."
5,Great Blank Media,These discs are the best blank media you can get.They'll work with virtually any drive and can write up to 18x speed.
1,These are NOT SONY DVDs,These Dvds arrived today and at the suggestion of others I used DVD Identifier to determine if these DVDs were made by SONY. They are not! They are made by RITEK corporation. It sucks that we are all suckers to these corporations and there manipulations. First disk I tried burning had errors.
2,Sony 100 pk blank DVD +R,I was expecting much better performance than I achieved. 20% failure rate. Am now having great success with Amazon Basics blank DVDs.
4,fantastic trash!,"I liked both these movies. They were very, very low budget films. Thirsty Dead is a bit tame, but still bizarre and fun. Swamp of the Ravens has eerie zombies and actual autopsy footage. There is an episode of some horror show with Lon Chaney, and a bunch of (i can't believe anyone would make movies like these) trailers. A super cool easter egg too."
1,Not what I thought...,"No Power Rangers are in this at all, just the megazords, and it's not even that perfectly applied... I was really hoping for a better graphics version on the ps1 lightspeed rescue..."
2,Where is the Ranger Fighting???,"I got the game and I always loved Power Rangers, watched it ever since the beginning, and most of the games are really awesome. But this one is an exception.My biggest problem with this game is that there's no fighting as the rangers. It's just completing missions in the zords, which is okay, but I expected more. I understand it's a budget game, but yeah, no actors from the show doing voices, no dinothunder theme song, and no fighting. I wouldn't recommend this unless your a hardcore fan of the power rangers. Honestly this should have been called ""Power Rangers Dino Thunder: Zord Battles"" or something like that, because that's all it is."
1,don't work,my game dosn't workk... its the second time i bought this game w a diferent seller.. my kid love power rangers !!!. so i get him a gamecube power rangers disc for his wii..
1,A Old PR Fan's Review,"A few days back went out a got the game its only 20 bucks and theres a reason. You can only play as Yellow, Blue and Red, but even more only as there Zords. You can't even play the rangers...personally i think thats kinda silly.I was hoping it was like the old SEGA Game from the MMPR movie, that was a good game...made no sense but it was fun...you can get the game if you want too 20 bucks for a PS2 game won't bust your bank, but if your looking for a old style PR game with hand to hand cobat with foot solders...Giant Robo fighting is all you got here"
1,I don't know what they were thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy this game, it's a complete waste of money,I mean it really really stinks! go see the movie instead."
5,A Must for Wilcox Lovers,"This is a great collection of Wilcox's prose and poems. What I like about this collection is it encompasses a wide variety of her works. Not only her more sentimental and passionate works, but also those that are on a more practical level."
4,X-Men X-Treme!!,"X-Men II:Clone Wars is a fantastic action-adventure game for the Genesis console. It boasts large character sprites, clean, colorful graphics, a huge number of intersting levels, and who doesn't like being able to pick Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast, Gambit, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, or even Magneto to play as before each level? The plot is fairly thin (so thin you won't even notice it), but that's not where the fun factor is: clean, fast, powerful action, big, varied levels (Siberian taiga to Asteroid X to the Amazon rainforests), and big, fast bosses make this game into a Genesis masterpiece."
4,Good purchase,"The flatware is good quality and faux wood handles look great. The curvature on the spoons and forks is a little more than what we prefer, so we bent them each back a little to better suit us."
1,A huge disappointment!,"I hate to rain on the parade of all these glowing reviews, but this book is a product of shoddy, lazy, amateurish research. A full 59% of the footnotes are based on secondary sources, & a full 25% of those are from one source alone which the author himself admits is unreliable. The section on Aaron Burr's mother is based on a ""source"" well-known for decades to be [untrue]. The discussion of Burr as a ""slave-owner"" is totally misleading, based on assumptions for which there is no evidence, & completely overlooks Burr's well known anti-slavery record. I could go on & on, but you get the picture. The book is full of factual errors, misleading assumptions, & faulty logic. Theodosia Burr Alston needs a good biography, but this isn't it."
4,Theodosia Burr Alston,"I have recently published a paper on Theodosia Burr Alston in a medical journal, concerning her medical history and mysterious death. In the process I read numerous articles and books.Cote's scholarly biography, in my opinion, stands out as the best book written about this fascinating individual and her family. I especially enjoyed reading Cote's theories of Theo's disappearance and the mystery of the Nag's Head portrait. Overall, the book is easy to read and provides a panoramic view of this period in American history."
3,A Decent first outing,"It been twenty year since the a truce between the Colonials and the Cylons. Now scavengers search space trying to cylon technolgy and a man called Tom Zarek has come upon a research station where humans and cylons live together. The Battlestar Galactica with crewmember William Adama and Saul Tigh are on scence to see what the research station is truly hiding.""The Cylons' Secret"" is the first original book based on the new Sci-Fi channel show. While it was decent I was missing many of the characters that make the new show so great. I am willing to the other books a chance to be better."
1,this is NOT a how-do of dog training,"This is a book of 'inspirational' stories extolling the virtues and benefits of positive reinforcement in training problem dogs. There is no actual information as to how an owner can do this at home. The author, a dog psychologist by trade, hints that these details may be found in another of his books called ""The How and Why of Psychological Dog Training"". Amazon doesn't seem to carry that title which makes me wonder if the book may have a new title. Had I known this in advance, I would have spent my $$ dollars on the real training book rather than on this thin story book."
5,Beautiful Inside & Outside,"This is a FANTASTIC CD! It combines, a hot latin sound with pop, hip hop and rap rythms, and of coarse the very sweet voice of Patty Cabrera. This CD has something for everyone! I strongly recommend it."
4,"Good Product, Wrong Color","Good sturdy product with all needed screws and pegs. The only problem, and for me it was big, is that the color shown in the photo doesn't match the actual product I received. Looks bronze color, but is actually a shiny polished silver."
3,A fun racing game that will keep you busy for minutes!,"This is the greatist horse racing game that you will ever play. Every year, I watch all the great horse racing events on TV. I decided that I wanted to get a good and realistic looking horse racing game. I went on EBAY and bought a Sega Genesis and then bought the game. Jee, I love it! SO realistic. Great Graphics and realistic gameplay make it awesome. You can race on 15 different tracks and compete in the Kentucky Derby! The only difference between real horseracing and this game is that in the game, instead of riding around on horses, you ride around on broom sticks. Makes the game even more realistic! I suggest this game to anybody. I give it 5 stars!"
3,No racial boundaries in hiphop,"I bought this dvd because i was interrested in seeing how hiphop influenced other cultures in the world, except for the blacks, whites and latino's. As far as i know Jin is the first asian rapper to get thsi far. In this DVD you can follow him throug some promotional concerts he did and also see him freestyle some. His family also get interviewed. What you don;t get to see, are the battles he did on BET."
5,Always fresh water for your pet,"I have the petmate fresh flow purifying water and is excelent. If you are away for few days it has another container to keep water in the fountain., the water is always circulating and the filter keeps the water clean for your pet, the only thing is that is very hard to find the filter. You need to change the filter once or twice every year."
2,"Sounds better than it is, for some cats.","It works fine, but my cat won't use it.I was thrilled with the reviews I read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived. Unfortunately, I like it better than my cat does. He largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass. Oh well.Before you buy, make sure it's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat. This fountain has no water sound (pretty quite, actually). I think that's why my cat ignores it."
3,All right....,"This fountain is all right. It worked a lot better in the early days, but now it seems like the pump is wearing out. Perhaps it needs a more powerful pump? I'm not entirely sure. My cats do like it, as it keeps the water moving, but you still have to clean out the dish quite often, which is something that I didn't expect to have to do so much. It does make a humming noise, but that doesn't really bother us as our house can get quite noisy with the two cats and our two year old son. I've never had any problems with it leaking. Overall, it's a decent product."
1,cat fountain,Had a previous model that I loved; this one is way too hard to clean and the autofill does not work well.
1,VERY VERY LOUD,I agree with the review that say it sound like a coffee grinder. And we also made all the adjustments. Our cat is terrified of it and has opted for drinking the Christmas tree water instead. It was in a room several rooms away from our bedroom and it kept me up all night. I'm throwing it out tonight.
2,kitty loves it - but its problematic!!,"My cat loved to drink out of the tap. So we bought this pet fountain to keep it off the sink. it works and the cat loves it, but the thing started leaking the second or third day after we bought the product. we have changed the filters and re-assembled the product (in case we assembled it wrong) but it still leaks! It also leaks slowly and we have hardwood floors - so we did not see the leaking until the floor started to swell a little! this could be specific to the product that i bought, but i am seriously looking for an alternative. it's great and quiet if it works well!!"
2,good for vacations,"I got this product to provide water to my cats while I'm away on short trips. The product is a bit noisy, so if you live in a small space, it can be a bit irritating. My main complaint is that you have to clean the dish on a frequent basis, which is not an easy task because the pump is not completely sealed off from the water. I also worry because I've had trouble with mold developing in the unit. Another reviewer said the the product was better than an alternative spout-design fountain because this product causes water to flow down a ramp; the fact is, the ramp is just one more thing to get dirty. I don't want my cats to drink dirty water. I don't think this product is sanitary enough to use on a regular basis--even with regular cleanings--but it can hold a lot of water while you're away on short trips."
2,Not the best...,"This was a painful read. The writing was littered with redundancies and little cohesion. The concepts revealed could have been adequately expressed in a much shorter journal article. However, it is one of the only books that addresses the issue of governance vs government.Bottom line: if it is absolutely necessary to teach changes in governance, this is an acceptable option until a better work is published. The casual reader should steer clear."
2,Stenciling and Embossing for greeting cards,Nothing like I expected. Actually quite outdated. Cards seemed antiquated. Next time I will look at date book was published. Thank you.
4,Tasty fruit snack,"This is a great snack that also taste great. I am on Weight Watchers trying to loose weight so I have this snack mid day to curb my apetite. It works, thanks.!!"
3,A little bitter,The product came on time. And overall tasted ok. There was a little bit of a bitter taste to one of the fruit....this it was the apricots.
4,MMMMMMM Good,I found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack. I have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just don't taste that good. Nice surprise.
5,Healthy & Delicious On-the-Go Snack,"I ordered these for my 2 and 4 year olds after purchasing at a local health food store (for double the price). My girls love them! They are all natural, with no sugar added, and taste delicious. I had been looking for a portable snack and these are perfect. Even better, the fruit is grown in the U.S. so I have full confidence in this company and product. I highly recommend this snack!"
5,My was of enjoying this product,I like to mix the cherry one with one of the other fruit packages in my hot tea. It is healthy and delicious!
5,Sega Power Rangers Movie,"The game wasn't as juicy as the SNES, but I thought that being able to start out as a morphed ranger... was a bit boring, but what was good was being able to choose between the original 6 in a few stages, then a few with the 3 new ones (Rocky, Adam, and Aisha). Also, some stages where you can select which Zord to use was creative. Too bad the SNES didn't have that."
1,Ew again...,"Again Power Rangers are not cool and not good, they don't deserve even one star. Thier show was one of the many reasons Sonic the Hedgehog got canceled. Maybe the only reason."
2,For die-hard fans only,"Not many games are as mindless as T2, and believe me, that's not a compliment. You do the same old thing over and over until you can't take it anymore. And while it's kind of fun at first, it dries up quickly. Pass on this one."
4,"Excellent , but format could be improved","Now including 15 years of full text of these premier Anesthesia journals it is an excellent value for the money, easy use, fast search capabilities, and tremendous amount of content. Each year it adds up the most current year.The only observation I would make with this and all the other versions (of which I own all since 1995) built with the same engine, Knowledge Finder, is that the images are available sometimes in low resolution, which limits its usability for using in presentations for teaching.The display format in the screen is not easily read, but is better than the poor printout format which many times is cumbersome to read, as well as a limitation in which images get printed at the end of the text.Overall, it is an excellent value, but I wonder if it would be a much better format to have all the content close to the original format, as ie. stored in Acrobat, and using an appropriate search engine, as I understand Acrobat is rather slow for this."
2,the collectors guide to switchblade knifes,"Some pictures and grading info, has a wide array of types and years of knifes. ""Antique American Switchblades"" is ten times a better source."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 7 - ID#12299,"Four movies on one disc.Horror Classics Vol. 7 - Platinum Disc ID#12299#1: Night of the Living Dead - 1968 - Director: George A. Romero#2: Christmas Evil - 1980 - Director: Lewis Jackson#3: The Ghost - 1963 - Director: Riccardo Freda#4: The Snake People - 1968 - Director: Jack HillAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
3,Not quite as powerful as another model,"I compared this model and another I'd been purchasing for years, and it's not as powerful. Stange because it uses the same batteries and looks virtually the same except the bullet on the new one is smaller (probably 2/3 smaller or maybe even 1/2 the size). My previous one was a Jel-Lee Flicker...and was awesome until it began to not do so well after a year or more."
4,"Not perfect, but so worth the trouble!","This baby is incredible! I will never be without one again. I had my first one for nearly a year before it died. It got lots of use in that time! The second one I bought on Amazon arrived with a dead battery and a torn rubber sleeve. Upon replacing the battery, I found that it burnt out my new battery within a week (I only used it twice in that time). So I just pop out the battery after each use. Kind of a pain. So Amazon is replacing it for me, free of charge. Very good service. I hope the new one doesn't kill my batteries the same way, but it's so worth it! Keep a supply of 9V's on hand. A fresh Duracell and you'll be in heaven!"
2,A Let Down,"At first I was happy.., for about 3 minutes, then it starting losing its power. I changed the battery 3 times, and had the same results. It runs on a 9v and starts with powerful vibrations, and within a few minutes fades down do a dull ""buzz"". After being shut off for about an hour I tried again with the same results."
2,"Awesome for a month, then broke",This would get 5 stars if it didn't break in a month. The metal portion that touches the left side of the battery broke off. It has super strong power and I liked the various speeds.
3,Eh... It gets the job done.,"I had a cheaper vibrator that did a better job. My other vibrator (which broke, the cord frayed) had nothing but vibration that got stronger. This one has 3 pulse settings, which really didnt do anything for me, and two vibration settings, which I thought should have been reversed. The vibration settings dont go near high enough. It takes longer but it gets the job done. It is rather noisy though."
5,Charger gets the job done!,There is nothing special about this charger - it simply gets the job done and charges the phone well.
2,More frustrating than helpful,"Out of all the MCAT review books I got, I used this one the least. It wasn't very helpful: the questions aren't arranged in a very practical way, and the questions didn't much resemble actual MCAT questions--they require a more detailed/extensive knowledge of science than you really need. This book won't help you refine your reasoning skills, which are what you most need. Try Examkrackers instead--much better."
1,Ugh,"This game probably would have been awesome if it had been made for the Atari 2600 in 1981, but on the PS2 platform the thing is like a big dump in your shorts. The graphics are atrocious, the action is terrible, the mustic was made on a $20 Casio, the tracks are depressing, and I don't think the game will last twenty-four hours in my house.I bought this game because I just have to have snowmobile games. Forget you ever started reading this review and buy Arctic Thunder and Sled Storm. Both games have flaws, but are infinitely better than this thing."
1,"No, it really is a bad flick","One star given because the story does have a beginning, a middle and an end, and the camera was pointing it the right direction (most of the time). Seriously, I think my head would explode if I tried to watch this again. Paint by numbers 'thriller' in that (in)famous Canadian Cinema Verite Style (that makes about as much sense as this movie). Some seriously wooden 'acting', and some of the most contrived plotting you will ever see. I'm saddened to see Michael Madsen (a guy I like alot) in such garbage, but it seems he is really a 'C' level actor who occasionally gets to act with the big boys. Take a pass here my friends."
3,Not A Bad Flick,"This isn't such a bad flick. I get every Michael madsen flick that they put out and even though I'm a huge fan of his i must say alot of flicks are garbage, but this one is isn't too bad made in Canada for alow budget, and still they mnaged to pull off some cool action scenes, some very cool motorcycle chases, and some very big explosions."
4,Very informative,I learned so much while reading this book. It made me a little scared for the future of arts. I admire the courage Jane Alexander had to take on such a huge responsibility. She truly is a force to reckon with. She has such style and grace - I believe that's why she was so wonderful at her job.
3,Robert Vaughn as a caveman..... priceless,Tennage caveman:Robert Vaughn as a caveman.... just this is worth the price ofadmission. Our Man from Uncle is running around the prehistorictimes looking for answers. This is not a bad movie...i actuallyfound myself enjoying this film. Love those 1950's haircuts andmost of the men all clean shaved. And the best part...there is astory.
3,Drive In Movies,"I bought this DVD for Teenage Caveman, a film that I remembered watching as a kid. It was all I remembered, cheesy story, B grade acting, all the things that make a bad movie good. I figured Viking Women and the Sea Serpant was free. I'm glad it was a free movie because it is just bad, once was enough on that one. If you like the old B movies you will have some fun watchin these old movies that were so bad they made me laugh with joy"
4,Simply a great game,"I owned this game for my ps2 but lost it. Now that it is available for the psp, I can take it anywhere. Overall,this game is fun,even though it is short I enjoy the music and the gameplay very much."
4,Buy this game,Anyone that missed out on this game on PS2 should pick it up on PSP. This is a beautiful example of simplistically innovative gameplay. If you play guitar or like J-Rock or even enjoy multiple genres of music in general this is the game for you. This game is to rhythym action games as guitar hero was tomusic action peripherals. Please give it a chance; you won't be disappointed.
5,Worth the hunt,"This is a great follow-up to the first novel (Night Calls). The pace set in the first book doesn't slacken, the characters feel right, the story is gripping, and the writing is so smooth as to be nearly invisible, like you're floating along in the story rather than translating words on a page into mental images. I picked it up one evening before dinnertime, and neglected to eat dinner and stayed up past my bedtime in order to finish it. I can't wait for the next book."
5,"Second Allie book, yay!","What a great thing to have another Allie book! Night Calls is a keeper, and this one is too. The magic is real but it doesn't overwhelm the people."
5,Already awaiting the third!!!,"I stumbled upon this book by accident. I was looking for a horror about witchcraft and found this book instead. Since I am not an avid Fantacy reader I was hesitant to start this book, but once I did there was no turning back!! I found Allie to be a character with whom all ages can relate to even though she is only thirteen in the novel. I absolutely can not wait for the next book in this series!!! I seriously hope there will be one because I am looking forward to watching this young heroine grow up and develop her already massive powers."
2,"Slow, Crashes, but nice idea...","I'd wait to buy this until they come out with version five or so. By then, the bugs might be gone. As it is now, I'm using Outlook 2002 on a Windows XP 3ghz machine with 1gb of RAM, and it takes me 34 seconds to load Outlook (time for the splash screen to go away). Occasionally it will tell me it had to disable PlanPlus on startup as well. The memory usage (if you leave it open all the time like I do) is high as well, although I don't notice it much, having such a leet box (translation: fast computer).I do give them 2 stars instead of 1 because it's pretty. I decided to use it based on screenshots alone. Outlook 2002 on its own is really dull, especially after you've looked at it daily for years. The extras (like the Compass, Mission/Values, and Goals) are very similar to their planner kits' first few pages. So if you liked those, I'm sure you'll enjoy the extras on PlanPlus."
1,Trashes Outlook 2003 Install,"I installed the trial version, downloaded from the franklincovey website. It crashed twice during install, and now MS Outlook takes several minutes (yes MINUTES) to launch. I tried to uninstall this piece of crap, but it will not uninstall.Do not pay money for this product!"
1,Perhaps 2.0 is better,I wouldn't risk it based on the reviews here. The first version ruined my Exchange profile - now I can't have tasks in Outlook -EVER. FC Support is worthless. So ironic that a company that puts so much emphasis on integrity and excellence put out such an incredibly shoddy product. I'm sorry - I can't trust a company that would release such an incredibly bad product.
2,"Bugs, bugs, bugs...","I downloaded the 30 day trial of the previous version and found it to be quite useful. I later purchased 2.0 and am very disappointed with it. It has slowed down Outlook considerably - I have a P4 2Ghz with 1 GB memory and it's slow! There are also many bugs associated with reading email. It sometimes returns to inbox after reading a message, other times it pulls up the next message. It does not let you mark a message as unread. Sometimes when using the scroll bar it will pop up a an email message randomly???"
2,"Nice interface, but really slow","I am running PlanPlus on a 10 month old Gateway 450 laptop. XP is my operating system. Accordingly, I think my computer, while not brand new, ought to be able to accomodate the general office tasks I ask it to perform.Plun Plus has a nice interface-- I like having all the outlook features in front of me and it's relatively easy to use the FranklinCovey tools. That said, it takes forever to load Outlook now and probably every third time I open an email box, I get 90 seconds of the hourglass. The irony is stark: this tool that promises increased productivity has become a barrier to that objective. I wish I had paid attention to the 30-day try-out period, because I would have sent it back. Wish I had bought it on Amazon, too, because I would have payed considerably less."
4,Works well on my system...,"I am running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition on a Motion Computing Tablet PC and MS Office 2003. This software works very well with this configuration, and the wizards do help get a handle on the FranklinCovey time management system.I do like the PlanPlus Home page a great deal."
2,"Great concept, buggy execution","I like the FrnklinCovey priority concepts and ideas. I like the ability to sort tasks by dragging and dropping to set priorities. But PlanPlus crashes, crashes, has unexplained behaviors.... I feel for the Covey support guys - they must be pulling out their hair."
1,PlanPlus version 6.0 is as bad as all others reviewed here.,"I have been buying, downloading, installing, and using software for almost 30 years, and this is without a doubt the worst piece of software I have ever encountered. Outlook only loads after clicking through nine error dialogs, it creates 5 empty tasks and 5 error emails to support. If it loads, and that is only 30% of the time, most windows are flaky. For instance clicking on a new project opens a blank email. Any element of the Palm application will reset the palm.DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!"
1,Less than 1 star,"I've just spent the last hour helping a client to get FranklinCovey software of his machine so he can use outlook again. It seems his daughter clicked on the wrong thing while using a thesaurus site. Dodgy software.Should anyone else arrive here while trying to escape this mess, they'll want this URL: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303930"
4,After a year + I am re-reviewing this... HINT - I don't use it any more,First off...there is a 30 day trial to download from the web if you want to try it out first (BUT BUY IT FROM AMAZON...they have the best price and you will want it). Some of the other reviews I read said they had problems with the program.Unless you have a tablet PC you have problems with this program...and even then some of it was kind of funky to work with. But worth it if you can handle the small quirks.
3,"Good, but could have been better","This is a rather decent fighting game starring DC's premier superhero team. The roster of characters is a bit limited (What! No Green Lantern?) However all the mainstays of the JL are here-Yes,even Aquaman. But the computer A.I. is pretty cheap. It's fursturating to be trying to land one hit, and geting pummeled by the Flash quicker than, well...The Flash. Also, the special moves are rather tough to pull off, and when you do a special you usually have no ideal how you did it. If the game were more balanced, and had more characters to choose from, it would be more interesting. As it stands, it's good, but could have been so much more."
5,What a great collection of hits!!!,"This CD is great! You start off with the song ""Small Town Saturday Night"". There are many other great songs on there as well. ""Sure Love"" and ""Hearts Are Gonna Roll"" are fine examples of great songs. His best song on this collection is ""Satisfied Mind."" It is an absolutely beautiful song. Tony Arata has done it again. I saw on another review that Randy Travis has this song on his ""You and You Alone"" album. Hal Ketchum sings it well, but since it did not end up being a release, I hope Randy Travis can do something with it. In the meantime, keep the hits coming, Hal!!!!!!!!"
5,Amos69er,"This is a great recording and this guy (Hal Ketchum) Is a fabulous singer. I plan to order more. I got it at a really great bargain, and received it before the targeted date of delivery."
3,Vosloo fan reviews Reason to Die,This movie is about a bounty hunter(Wings Hauser) who goes after a man(Arnold Vosloo) who jumps bail and heads back to his native South Africa. Once the man gets to South Africa he starts to hunt down prostitutes. Hauser tries to catch and stop him. There's alot of action and alot of Arnold in this movie. Okay story line. A MUST for Vosloo fans.
4,"Graphics are outdated, but a good game regardless.","I like playing this more than the board game because there aren't all of the pieces to set up. Also, things such as cards are done automaticlly."
2,This game is boring and I hate it.,"Board games are not supposed to be translated to video game platforms. Risk is a slow-moving, colorless, blank game that is only fun to some degree if playing with friends. Otherwise the computer opponent will relentlessly hunt you down and kill you, although the AI isn't too good. The controls aren't bad, but who cares! Buy the board game."
4,"It fits, it works, what more can you ask of a filter...","Shipping took a couple days longer than expected, but that was fine. It had an oily residue on the black rubber, which I'm sure was to keep it soft for a tight fit. Smelled a little like mineral oil, so I just installed it, and ran the filter in another room for a couple of hours. I then put it in the bedroom where it lives. Works great. Can't seem to beat the price anywhere else."
5,Great band if you like Modern Celtic style,"I used to live in Scotland and discovered this band there. They are a really great group and this is one of my favorite albums from them. I had it on cassette and needed to upgrade to CD for my car now. The style is what I would call Modern Celtic Rock. This is the type of live band that you would find playing in local Edinburgh pubs at night. Some songs are more Rock and some are more Celtic, but the voices and styles are great on all. The music ranges from slow to fast options, and I love playing this on road trips. It is great background tunes to the passing scenery. The band has a great viewpoint in their songs as well, that really speaks to the Scottish experience. Not sure if this part will fully convey to those not familiar with the culture, but the music is still great if you like the Celtic style."
2,Probably good but in French,"This book contains a wealth of knowledge and many color photos, but if you're interested in the Panhard VBL you need to learn French. A great many military books of this type are courteous enough to include English as well, so a greater number of people can enjoy what they offer. As it is, this becomes little more than a very nice picture book. Disappointing at this price. Of course, the description clearly says ""French"", so you are warned. Now twice."
2,Terrible,"Dor's articulation of Lacanian clinical structures reads more like a literary dramatization of certain character types than an engaged analysis of various Lacanian structures. Apart from occasionally throwing the terms ""castration"" and ""phallus"" about, he mostly lampoons stereotypical forms of neurosis in highly moralistic terms... For instance, he speaks of the ""pathetic"" attempts of obsessionals to keep women at bay by turning them into objects. Now why would a psychoanalyst refer to any behaviour on the part of his analysands as ""pathetic"" or even admirable? This book reads more like those popular personality diagnostics than a rigorous Lacanian analysis of psychic structures. If you're looking for a real introduction to the clinical dimension of Lacan's thought read Bruce Fink's _A Clinical Introduction to Lacan_ where you'll find both structural analysis of the three Lacanian types along with case studies. Don't waste your time on Dor."
2,Not Worth It,"This book is mostly a transcription of lectures, and as such it is basically pretty flimsy. The so-called ""structures"" are presented quickly in a mere flourish of words, thus there is really no opportunity in such a style and mode of presentation of even beginning to have any kind of real practice in these structures--or even to know what such a thing is. This is a patched-together publication that will do nothing but placate those who have no real desire to encounter Lacan, but just want the tabloid version, which, unfortuneately, is what this ""Lacanian Clinical Series"" seems to be all about. There's really not much of substance here, but then, this appears to be the trend in most publishing on Lacan in the US nowadays."
4,Forgotten Truths,"In following with Sir Anderson other works, when reading this book it becomes quite clear why this is the same man from Scottland Yard who caught Jack the Ripper. Clearly his heart for knowledge is shown in his indepth look into the Bible and God's wisdom for our lives. The truths explained are quite applicable for our society so filled with malfescience."
5,So what if it's not 3-D blood and gore?,"This is a classic. You are Simba making his way through various challenging levels, each of which represents a different event from Disney's The Lion King. Every level has creative challenges Simba must overcome (you'll find that you often must avoid being squashed by a rolling boulder). Your main opponents are hyenas and hot lava, your health comes from bugs, the evil mastmermind boss is (of course) Scar, the graphics are absolutely charming, and you even see Simba's age progression when he suddenly appears with a mane.It's a simple, well-done, happy little game, and definitely more than worth your [$]."
3,The Lion King,"In this game you run around as a stupid little lion who wants to be the King.I think it is good for younger kids, but not for older ones."
2,Flawed guide to a great game.,"Myst IV is a great game, and any serious gamer knows this. But the guide is another matter. There are some serious errors, and if you rely on it too heavily, you will be very frustrated and you'll stop progressing in the game. Instead, use a site like GameFaqs that has user-written walkthroughs that have been tried and tested."
2,"Buy the game, not the guide.","While Myst IV: Revelation is another beautiful, great game in the Myst series, this guidebook is not so great. If you are playing a game that relies heavily on difficult puzzles, then you need a good guide - however, this one is full of errors. It took me hours to figure out why I couldn't get past some puzzles after following the guide, only to realize it had given me the incorrect information in order to solve them. It would be better to find an online guide or walkthrough, instead.Please, don't judge a game by its guide!"
4,movie 3 pack,all of these movies are really bad. I laughed hysterically at these. I do not suggest purchase unless you are like me and love the really bad b-flick.
5,Great Harmony!,"I've always loved their song ""Mr. Sandman"" - so I ordered the CD just for that song, but I have really enjoyed the rest of the CD as well. Their harmony is incredible and it brings back lots of memories. Fun to listen to."
4,fun from the fifties,"I bought the cd for Born To Be With You, but it was great to hear Mr. Sandman and Lollipop again as well as other great songs. Very enjoyable CD."
5,Altan's Best,"Although I own all their albums, this by far is my favorite Altan record. Harvest Storm was their first masterpiece, but this is Altan's crowning achievement. While there were fine performances on there earlier recordings like The Red Crow, they hadn't yet refined their exhilarating mixture of sweetness & fire. More recent major label recordings, unfortunately, saw too much smoothing of their edges (although 2000's ""Another Sky"" was a return to form). Island Angel perfectly captured that balance & was the last album to feature late, founding flute player Frankie Kennedy. An album every Celtic/Irish music lover should own and the place to start any Altan collection."
5,The 2nd best CD from the best Celtic group,"Island Angel is a supurb record filled with haunting songs, along with reels and jigs that are fast and dynamic. This record also contains Altan's finest song: An Mhaighdean Mhara as well as Dulaman, Jug of Punch, and the title track.However, somehow the record just doesn't hang together like Harvest Storm does. Perhaps the transition from reel to song is too violent. I personally find the reels enjoyable, but...Is this an angry record? The co-founder of the group, Frankie Kennedy, died from cancer a bit more than a year after this music was recorded. Perhaps the reels are a shade too ""aggessive"" as a result? Who knows.In any event, this record is so good you won't believe that better music can be found, until you hear Harvest Storm.If you like Loreena McKennit, Enya, or Clannad, I'm sure you will like this."
5,Covert Surviellance & Electronic Penetration,Covert Surviellance & Electronic Penetration is the best book of its type ever written. I advise the customer to buy this book- just to buy it. It is a good book on this subject for learners and experts alike!
5,Works great,"The static electricity has gone down 200% since buying this filter! Easy to install. Did not have to rinse off like others said, no smell!"
5,great quality -- great price,"Same as the filters I purchased locally from Heating dealer, but at less than half the cost. They were shipped fast, and were of excellent quality."
4,Good Product,"These seemed like the exact product that I took out of my GeneralAire humidifier which is reassuring. Fit was great, but as mentioned, be prepared for a dusty mess. Open it over the sink and give it a quick rinse because the soot is irritating. My only small complaint was the excess shipping charge. I've shipped numerous books that weighed more, showed up quicker and at half the price that I payed for this ship. The only thing that kept this from 5 stars."
5,Truly innovative thinking,"Sagmeister is a true artist and thought-provoking designer. His ideas are fresh, unexpected and sometimes shocking. He's an industry hero and this book is filled with so many wonderful examples of his work. His solutions will inspire designers and make non-designers do a double-take."
5,"Thanks, Stephan!","This book was such a relief for my eyes when they're all been fed up with fancy, trendy , modernistic, digital-based design books (or whatever they call themselves).I realized that I could think and do more than ""well-produced mediocrity"", thanks to you, Stephan (Hope I'll be in your class one day. I just drew a picture of myself sitting at the table under the slogan fart=style in your office. I know that's where I'll be sitting at 3 years from now)Best of the Best Books of the Year!"
4,Olfactory Effects.,"All I can say is...wow! This book hits all senses like a Mac truck, intentionally and unintentionally by Sagmeister. I love that this book is a design piece in itself...but wait...I'm taking off the red sheath/condom, paging through --- WTH! I'm tripping out in an auto showroom filled with new car tire aroma downwind from a super glue factory!Every page turn is a whaft of the God knows what alchemy that made the red cover and/or the metallic page trim. So I've got the book airing out, pages fanned open, then I can sit down and indulge in this work. I know from a brief glance through it it's fabulous."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE if you are a designer who loves good inspiration,This is a fantastic collection of works By Sagmeister. The insights and commentary are one of the big sellers of this book. You can also see the changes in style that he went through during the course of the beginnings of his career to where he is today.
4,Pretty fun.,This is a pretty fun game if you love power rangers. Its really short though and can be beaten in 5 minutes. But overall its worth having especially if you are a fan of power rangers.
1,I learned not to skimp on HDMI cables,"Works fine for most devices, but when I tried to use these with my AverMedia HD video capture card, one of them wouldn't work at all and the other one only worked in one direction (I had to plug a specific end of the cable into the card -- the other end didn't work). I know the card wasn't the problem because I tried it with a cable from a retail store and it works perfectly. Moral of the story: don't skimp on the cables you use to connect your expensive electronics."
3,Cables Wouldn't Work For Macbook Pro,"The cables will probably work fine if you are using 720p resolution or maybe a smaller 1080p television set (32""-46""). But if you are using a higher end television I wouldn't recommend it. I used it on a 55"" 240Hz 3D LED Sony TV and it looked like it was a little choppy when playing movies in 1080p. Also the cable did not work with my macbook pro, as another review stated. Overall its a good cable for the price but if you have higher end equipment you should probably just buy a cable thats a little more quality. I ended up buying a media bridge cable for $6 more."
1,A short life,This cable failed after about 2 months use. I believe that the failure was due to a rather poor connection between the cable and one of the connectors. I will not purchase another cable from this vendor.
1,Did not work,"Ordered two cables and received both quickly. Unfortunately, neither cable worked to connect tv to cable box. I couldn't believe both cables could be bad right out of the box and ended up changing the cable box and requesting a service call. Sure enough, switch to the HDMI cable from the service tech and no problems. Both cables went straight into the trash."
3,Satisfied with price,"The shipping cost more than the cables, which work just fine. We occassionally lose picture from the home theater DVD player, but it may not be a result of the cable itself. Overall, we are satisfied with the purchase. Delivery was reasonable, I wouldn't have chosen USPS as my first choice, but they delivered nonetheless."
2,Didn't work well as part of an HDMI extension.,"I needed this cable as part of an extension with another 6' HDMI cable with a female to female coupler. On it's own, there wasn't any problem, but connected as part of the extension, I was getting some kind of ghosting or interference. I had no problem when I tested the extension with other HDMI cables.I emailed the company to return the product and was promptly refunded my money. It was probably what I should have expected from a $2 cable, but I was pleased that the company responded so quickly and with a refund.p"
4,Received 6 footers instead of 10 footers,I ordered 5 of these and they shipped me the 6' long cables instead of the 10' long cables. They work and so far I haven't actually needed the 10' long cables so no big deal I suppose.
1,IT'S AN EFFERT AT A COMEBACK BUT IT ALL SOUNDS THE SAME ONE SONG INTO THE NEXT,"TO ME VIXEN ISN'T VIXEN WITHOUT ALL OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS AND YOU CAN DEFFINITLY TELL THAT JAN IS NOT THERE,, MAYBE IT'S TIME TO REGROUP WITH THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS AND MAYBE GET SOME WRITING HELP , JUST A SUGGESTION I KNOW HOW HARD WRITING AND COMPOSING A SONG CAN BE . THIS IS CONSTRUCTIVE CRITISIZM ,NOT BASHING , I PROMISE. ANYWAY TAKE CARE AND GOOD LUCK TOWARD MUCH SUCCESS AND GOD BLESS. BARBARA"
2,kind of boring,well in a nutshell: is kind of boring and the visual effects are not great as in rez for dreamcast (similar and much better game). the levels are kind of hard and challenger but the game is mainly boring... thats it. so boring that there are not much else to be said!
4,good,"good package ,good box~ almost new ~ but in my oppinion , it's a boring game for me ~~~(only for me ~~>_<)"
3,Beyond Average,"I really like the idea behind the simple PSP title Every Extend Extra, and it is fun at times. However, in the long run it is just another puzzle game (the likes of which you can find all over the internet nowdays) and I honestly don't find myself replaying it very often. In any of the game's modes.If you enjoy Lumines, Bejeweled, ... maybe checkers... and/or other simple Flash type games, this is your kind of game. Though, it is average and replay value is a bit low on my scale."
1,Lacks incentives to keep you playing.,"The title of this review says it all. I'm going through a library of games and trying to play each one for at least an hour. I couldn't stand this game after 15 minutes!I believe a key ingredient to a fun game is incentives; Give the gamer a reason to keep playing. For example, in the game Grand Theft Auto you complete missions to reveal more story/plot or to earn access to new and more powerful weapons; 2 very powerful incentives.This game completely lacks incentive. Oh I'm on the next level, more flashing colors, random shapes and crappy repetitive music. Oh joy!Seriously there is no reason to play this. At least I can keep the spare game case LOL.Thank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful."
2,wanted to like it,"The high point about this game is definitely the mesmerizing graphics and great sound, it is a nice show. This game reminds me of Fantavision for the PS2. If you like that game a lot, you will probably like this one more than I do.I really like puzzle games. Tetris, Meteos, Lumines, Polarium, I've enjoyed them all. But when you get down to it, this game is just boring. I really recommend that you try this one before you buy it."
2,Sorry Jack,"Even Jack Palances gritty voice can't make this documentary creepy in the least. Other reviewers are right: the package blurb states this is about strange occurances that befall the cast and crew of The Omen. What they have done is overhype each and every problem that the filmmakers had into some pseudo-paranormal hyjinx. ""Mysteriously, there were 6 types of lunch meats, six of each, on six separate tables in the catering tent. A sign from Lucifer!"" Only kidding, that wasnt in the movie. But its that kind of embellishment that should make you say 5 Hail Mary's and take this out of your queue."
4,A GREAT DOCUMENRTY,THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENRTY ABOUT THE OMEN MOVIES AND ALL THE WEIRD STUFF THAT HAPPENED DURING FILMING. IF YOU LOVE THE OMEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS DOCUMENTRY
3,Godzilla fans alert!!!,"The only reason I bought this DVD was because of the Mecha-Streisand episode, which goofs on Godzilla, Ultraman, Gammera, Mothra, and features Cure frontman Robert Smith!!! Of yeah, Cartman's in it too. Its not often you see a Japanese monster homage in current pop culture, so I salute Trey and Matt for giving props to the big G."
4,A Christmas present,"This was a Christmas present for my 20 month old little girl from her grandparents. She enjoys playing with it and I know that as she gets older it will get alot of use. It is sturdy, pretty, and appropriate for little girls of different ages."
4,recommend,This is a nice little book with good pictures and the book itself is high quality. I recommend this to anyone with a little child who likes tea parties.
4,First Tea Party,Our granddaughters love this little book. They enjoy dressing up and having a tea party with all the treats.
2,"a ""little"" disappointed","My Very First Tea PartyThe book was very small, measuring about 5""x5"", and that didn't hold the interest of my three-year-old granddaughter. Also, the book came to me damaged along the spine of the book. Not a very good buy overall for the money."
5,Adorable!!!,This book is absolutely adorable. I purchased it for my 18 month old neice and plan to buy another for my baby girl too. It is a really nice story with adorable illustrations. Durable and perfect for little hands. What little girl doesn't like a tea party?
2,A bit too abstract,I started reading this book to my 20 month old granddaughter who loves books but she lost interest before I could finish. I think the pictures were a bit too abstract for her and the text a little too wordy. She might be more interested in it when she's closer to 3 years old.
4,My Very First Tea Party,The book arrived in a timely fashion. The book arrived in the condition specified by the review. I was pleased with my order.
1,unreliable,"very disappointed with this vendor. this was ordered as a Christmas present for a child. date for delivery when ordered was compatible with delivery by christmas. info that indicated delay occurred to late to reorder. very poor customer service. i will never, never use this vendor again."
2,Great book if you are a Christian...,"However I am not, and therefore was terribly dissapointed to find a blessing to God at the end of the book. Wish it had mentioned that in the description or at least shown that page in the ""look inside"" link. Would have saved me $ and hassle. Just a warning to those that may not practice a form of Christianity. Otherwise it is cute."
2,oop. didn't read earlier reviews re: religious content,"Blessing a tea party? good grief. Didn't realize this was part of the book when I purchased it. It's okay otherwise, but certaintly not appropriate for its intended audience."
5,Sweet and simple,My daughter (4) and I enjoy this book. It's a good pick for Mom when she's worn out at night and too tired to read a long story :) The book is rhyming which my daughter really enjoys. I like that it addresses manners and includes a prayer!
2,Could have made much better!,"This game was interesting for the first few weeks then I got to the 5 level and it wasn't fun anymore.They could of made it more exciting, which they didn't. The good things are that you can jump which is really exciting.The bad things are that theres only 4 horses and you can't do anything to them,also they are really slow.Another reason is I wish you could put leg wraps on and bell boots or splints on the horses.If anyone finds a game that you can jump and do other stuff please do a reveiw on it because i love jumping in real life on my friends Thoroughbred and competing in events around where i live.THankz"
4,some bad flaws but otherwise good,"When i first got Hitman 2 i was expecting a realistic 1st and 3rd person tactical/shooter. I was dissapointed when i found that you(47) could take about 25 shots from a 9mm pistol and not die. Also if the AI had an automatic gun they would shoot it like was a pistol. They would never switch to rock-and-roll mode and shoot at you. When you shot a 3 round burst from the m4 at an AI player's foot they would still be able to fight too. I was dissapointed with the unrealistic way the guns handled.The first person view was also a failure in my point of view. The perspective was way off. All the guns were too small in first person. I only play with 3rd person view.Other than all that, the graphics are great, The AI smart, the missions good, and the variety of weapons good."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I loved the first Hitman release because it was fresh even if it was a little rough around the edges.The Hitman2 sequel smooths off the rough edges on the engine and fixes some of the gameplay problems. Unfortunately, it lacks imagination. It feels like you're stuck in one level the whole game. Yeah, the scenery changes, but the gameplay is always the same. No adaptation, nothing new. This might be the reason the game feels like it's over before it begins - it's way too short for the money.Not to mention that they shipped this thing full of bugs. It crashed out on me more times than I can count. This is especially bad if you're playing without save games, since you lose big chunks of your progress when the buggy game dies. They'd better be working night and day on a service pack for this thing!..."
4,THE HITMAN FACTOR!!!,"Hitman was a hit cause it brought about a new meaning to gaming by intruducing 47 to the world.Its excellent levels,good storyline and irritating toughness makes it as crazily as possible-A WINNER.Then Eidos brings the sequel.HITMAN 2 and i got to be honest wih anyone who reads this review.This game is worth playing.There are a few control issues and it does get a bit tedious as you advance thru the missions,but you'll be so addicted to the game that to get a silent assasin rank you have to replay every level again devising 2 or 3 stratigies using elements in the game itself.That makes HITMAN 2 another winner.There are huge levels located in excotic places.Every level is different.Even the 3 st petersburg missions have different atmospheres.There are decent no of guns and snipers and an excellent storyline.MY FINAL COMMENTPlay this game even if you are new to the hitman series.IT WILL get boring after you FINISH the game 4 times"
2,okay,To slow meaning story. Just not into spending hours trying to learn the action keys. They have taken a video game and tried to make a pc game.
3,As good as the sequel,"I played Hitman: Contracts first and wanted more, but I was afraid that Hitman 2: Silent Assassin wouldn't be as much fun. Other than some very minor ways in which the game worked which had been improved, I enjoyed Hitman 2 just as much as its sequel."
1,Save your Breath : DOESN'T WORK ON XP!!,"Im not complaning because it stinks or anything but because of something big. THE GAME DOESN'T WORK ON XP!!!!! I returned it to see if it was my computer that is the problem but it is very common for hitman 2 to crash on windows XP. so if it says ""Direct3D : unable to create device. Try changing resolution or color depth"" and on XP. Return it immediately. I returned it and got it on Xbox."
4,decent but needs some changes,"Hitman2:Hidden assassin looks great and plays just like the first hitman title. Although some parts need to be changed.* You cant change weapons while running, like in 47*it pauses the game when you go into inventory, good or bad...maybe both*the in-game save. sure, everyone cried for it in 47 but it means you dont have to be as careful and tideious like in 47, it built more skills as an assassin. In game save is going to somewhat kill that by making it so easy to go back and reload whenever you mess something upOther that those things i though should be changed the graphics are great, same old gameplay and lots of fun to be had"
1,What a let down!,I've played Hitman 1 and loved it. It took Eidos 2 years to release this new installment. 2 years!! and this edition feels like an expansion pack at the most.NO STORYMANY BUGSA GREAT IDEA GONE BAD
5,KICKS FREAKING ASS!!!!,"I just got this game with my new sound card, and I have to say I can't stop playing it. The graphics are by far the best I've ever seen. The same goes for the audio and the gameplay in general. Let me put it this way, if I was stranded on a desert island with only one thing, it would be this game. Just holding the cd would be glory enough.*bows down before the makers of this game*"
4,An add-on to your collection,"the game is great. the variety of weapons, enemies, and choices to beat the mission is astounding. I am very hard to please when it comes to video games but this game is great. The bad thing is that the shooting/stealth becomes banal after a little while. The first 4-5 levels ae good. The next levels are pure ""empty all of your lead"" type of levels. I was amazed at the graphics and realisticness of the game. This game is good for older people only due to violence."
3,Hitman 2 or just an expansion pack???,"I was a huge fan of the first Hitman. Despite all the bad press it had been getting, I could see no fault with it. The idea of being able to play a professional hitman was beyond anything any other games had to offer at that time. The only fault that I had with the first Hitman was the lack of in-game saves.Hitman 2 gave us the saves. Fine. I was hoping more from the team in terms of 47's skills/movement abilities instead of just more weapons. What about mantling - climbing over walls? Or what about the ability to distract the guards .. say, throwing his voice around? Or throwing rock/coin? Scaling building with more high tech equipments?Hitman 2 is really more of the same, which is fine, really, if it is packaged as an expansion pack and not a sequel."
1,non functional product,"NOVA Corp. lists system & programs that are compatable, i.e. Windows XP and Adobe Illustrator. Product will not open. NOVA's customer service is unwilling to address the problem, or offer any solutions, so BEWARE! The product apparently is not capable of working within the systems and programs listed, and as I have been told ""It isn't thier problem"""
3,"Clip Art Is Great, Pictures leave much to be desired.","The clip art you get with this package is very good. I bought it for clip art that I could use for my engagement/wedding announcements, ""Save the date"" Magnets, Invitations, ect. For these purposes, the clip art was exceptional. The Catalogue sent with the program is a wonderful addition and is a definate plus. However, the pictures are where I felt the program makers let the customer down. There are only 5 categories of pictures. Three of those categories are religious. The other two categories are seasons and holidays, both of which are well stocked with great photos. If you are looking for A LOT of religious photos as well as,again, an excellent collection of clip art, this is your product. If you just want the clip art, again, this is your product. However, if you are buying it for the pictures and expect any sort of variety, do not buy this product."
3,Nova poor customer support,"While I realize our experiences with a company's customer service varies, I just want to echo another user's complaints with Nova. I have Their Seasons, Events, etc. software in addition to their Greeting Card and Business Card packages and found their suport to be quite terrible. It took multiple emails and numerous excuses (operating system corrupted, OS not designed well, etc.) before admitting their software was at fault. But, the price is right at $0.00 - a penny more is a penny too much, IMHO"
4,Mesmerizing,"I loved Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Light Raid was no different. I began reading it in the morning on the way to work and found it so entertaining that I simply could not stop reading it. I finished it in one day.Light Raid is a simple, yet exciting novel about a young woman who finds herself in the middle of a spy ring involving her own family. It takes place in a future where wars are no longer fought on the ground, but rather with laser beams directed by satellites.Light Raid is a light and fun read, full of mystery, suspense, wonderful characters and even a healthy dose of romance. Willis has a great knack for being able to draw the reader into the story from page one."
4,Entertaining,"This is an interesting story that takes place a few years (centuries?) into the future. Water has become an altogethor different resource, and it has caused the restructuring of North America. The culture is at once recognizable, and yet bizarre and takes place in places that don't strike many people as action centered. Like a chase scene in Victoria, British Columbia or references to the ""Prince of Saskatchewan""!!! There's family and ""Family"" dynamics going on, spying, romance, fun and tragedy. Entertaining and interesting"
3,Freddie King does it again,"Any Freddie King video is a good thing since he passed away almost 27 years ago. Howeer this DVD is not as good as some others of his. The first set in Montreux (June 20,1973) has Freddie and Co. having trouble with his vocal mic and at times he cannot hear himself sing. The second set in Sweden (December 19, 1974) is much better quality. Freddie plays a small club (almost looks like a resturant) most importantly he plays songs you dont have on other DVDs'. His third set is a carbon copy of the bonus material on the 1966 ""The Beat"" DVD from Sweden. If you have that DVD you already have this material. If you are a collector of Freddie king music pick this DVD up. It is worth a listen."
4,"Good-smelling, good price... good product","This doesn't smell like typical nail polish remover, it smells actually very pleasant. My only complaint is with getting off sparkly nail polish. Maybe I didn't let it sit long enough before trying to remove it, but it left some sparkles behind. Otherwise, I would give this a very good review. It was a bigger bottle than I was expecting, and it shipped fast. I would recommend this product to anyone who hates the smell of nail polish remover."
5,Great!,Its gentle to my skin. Beside some nail polish remover smells so bad but it does not. The smell is okay.
2,Okay,"I didn't feel like going to the store, so just ordered it online, there are no complaints with this product."
2,No No NO....,"I really do not want to put down Marie Osmond. Let's just say most of these songs were made in the '70s when she was a teen, with other people telling her what songs to sing and how to sing them. I LOVE Marie Osmond. But even I can't get thru these songs. This is the way that I feel is not even on here. That song and the album of the same name are really great and should be on cd. I lent my vinyl copy to a ""friend"" and never got it back. The best songs are the last ones on the cd and you can get those on her country cd's available at budget prices. Those are the best cd's to get if you're interested Marie's music."
5,"STUNNING, SPELLBINDING, MAGICAL!","This is simply breathtaking! I barely breathed for nearly two hours - that's how awestruck I was. Sure, if you know anything about American theatre, you love Elaine Stritch, but you've never experienced anything like this. I can't find adequate words to describe the magnificent journey she takes on as she recounts her life on and off the stage. Buy this! Watch this!It is simply, purely, honestly...magic."
5,Fabulous entertainment,"What a great DVD...this amazing performer Elaine Stritch is such a star - I am real fan of this great lady and just LOVED this DVD.....laughed, cried and loved every second of this terrific performer...love her!!!!"
4,"Always liked her, never saw enough of her","Ever since I knew she had done the one woman show have wanted to see it. Didn't know it was a life story thing but was not disappointed. Great energy performance. Funny, entertaining."
5,Stritch shines in one-woman show,"This is the one-woman show Elaine Stritch created for Broadway and for which she was given a well-deserved Tony Award. This is an autobiographical romp through her theatrical career with lots of great stories and songs, all woven together in great style by writer John Lahr (Bert Lahr's son). This special event was videotaped for HBO at the Old Vic in London and it's a magical evening, one I can't recommend highly enough if you are a fan of the musical theater. Elaine Stritch is in great form and shows off her dazzling skills as a masterful entertainer, much to the delight of the London audience. She is as well known for her West End shows as she is for Broadway and this is a great opportunity to see a fabulous performer telling her life story."
2,A has-been,"The reviewers here are rating the performer, not the show. Stritch looks haggard, sings horribly, and most of her stories are only interesting to her. A dreadful performance all around."
1,Shaq Fu,Shaq Fu is a game that should never have been created. Horrible 2D fighter and miserable plot. Great for a gag gift for a classic gamer.
3,shaq FU again,This was the version of Shaq Fu I owned the SNES version was my bros. This is a more playable but that ain't saying much you still have the same 7 broken fighters plus 5 more you fight the the old man from the dojo Leaoutsu a guy named Disel Shaq makes fun of his name before the fight but Shaq's nick name is Disel. Argus I don't know what he's suppose to be Nezu the kid you have to save then you get charged with assault on minor THE END! Yeah I wish the end no you fight some General dude who's a cheap MF. You fight Beast and Sett. Another difference was you got singles off the Shaq Disel album yeah that album went aluminium lol. I spent my allowance money to get this game when I was 9 thought I was the coolest kid ever no i was the lamest. I loved Shaq's raps too. Should've really bought Street Fighter SCE on GEN a actual fighting game. Play if you want to ROFL. I promise to review a good game it's going to be an awesome sega cd game coming soon.
5,Ride The Tiger,"I discovered Tiger Balm ""Ultra"" many years ago when a friend applied it to my shoulders, neck, and forehead to treat a headache. I use it frequently now to deal with chronic muscle tightness and soreness, and it works extremely well. I have also used the red ""X-tra Strength"" balm, and found it less efficacious for my needs.For people unfamiliar with this product, it is nearly 25% camphor and menthol, so it has a very strong smell. It may also feel fiery on first application. Bear with it. You will have very good results."
5,Tiger Balm,I was unable to find this product in the 50 gm size at any store in my area and was very happy to find it at Amazon. Have used it for years and will continue to use it as it is the best product for my needs.
5,"Prince Of Peace - Tiger Balm Ultra, 1.7 oz cream","Anytime I over do it, I reach for this knowing I will be ok. I have used this product for years and it has never let me down"
5,Great stuff,"I have used this pretty consistantly for the past 10 years and it as always worked well for me. Being petroleum based makes it stick to my skin better, but also makes it harder to get off my skin it I happen to get it somewhere I do not want. It stays active for many hours, it is good for general pain related to spinal, joint and muscles and it helpful for sprains."
4,Tiger balm,"This is an excellent ointment, I didn't like the container, it's a little difficult to open, price was good, smells nice."
4,Excellent,"While I agree with others that it seems like Bayside has slacked off with their lyrics and it seems the music has gotten catchy, I think the CD is still wonderful. This band never disappoints with their albums."
5,A journey of the soul,"In City of Rains the reader will not find surface inuendos nor the modern liberalism that has made the word ""relationship"" meaningless and temporary, rather, he will be drawn into the journey of his own soul...in all of its multilayered forms...to see that the seed of love in its purest state yearns to break through the soil of life experiences. I will read it again to nurture that seed in my own soul."
4,Nice remake of an old classic,"OK, first off, the graphics are a lot better than the Atari 2600 version :).If you're a fan of platform games, this is worth a look. The graphics are very good for 16-bit and the action is pretty consistent. You control a young Indiana Jones wanna-be who goes dashing through the swamps and jungles in search of lost Mayan treasure. Along the way you need to avoid snakes, crocodiles, and other such nasties. Jump pits, climb ropes, use your whip or your slingshot to fend off your enemies. Pretty fun game."
3,1 of 2 not bad...,"Heavy Gear 2 was an ok game, BattleZone 2 is a great game, I would recomend BZ2 to anyone who is into real time war / battle games!"
4,Great Biography. Lots of info.,Was a great Bio for all of the actors. Kind of depressing their stories of struggle. DVD was great. Reccomended for any classic monster/horror movie fan.
5,Heroes of Horror,A really interesting view of the Horror Masters and their lives. Have been wanting to get this for quite some time.
5,"excellent, thought provoking","Every person who is thinking through issues of Church and culture needs to read this book. Between doing nothing in culture and fighting unwinnable culture wars, Merrill finds a middle ground, a third way.Especially helpful to me was the section on the mythical ""good old days."" Those who believe in the notion that America was once a ""Christian Nation"" and solving our problems means getting back to that place would do well to read this short, challenging, highly engaging book."
4,Eco-drive is great,"The watch was a hit, my wife loved it. The only difficulty is setting it as you need to use tools - forceps."
2,Not applicable to Present Day Sports Gambling,"Bob McCune's book ""Education of a Sports Bettor"" contains little advice which would actually help one become a professional gambler. JR Miller, (who is a long term losing tout) sells McCunes books on his website. Much of the book consists of long ramblings which offers no help (maybe some wisdom) on handicapping.His baseball methodology will not work in todays market.. Sabermetrics is the way to go. I would suggest reading Michael Murray's ""Betting Baseball"" and the basketball information is rather outdated. You'd be better off learning how to statistically rate teams rather than use the simplistic method that Bob suggests. Betting the NBA is nowhere near as easy as when they article in this book was written (in the 1980's)I do not recommend buying this book."
1,Awful,"I'm not one to aimlessly bash writers or post baseless negative feedback, but this book is terrible. Save your $39.95 and invest it elsewhere.If you are a big fan of the ProfessionalGambler.com touts, buy ""JR Miller's How Professional Gamblers Beat the Pro Football Pointspread."" All the material that Bob McCune attempts to cover here, is covered in Miller's book in a clearer, more concise manner.Avoid Avoid Avoid!! For an aspiring professional gambler, this book provides NO valuable new information. This is the most eloquent writing about NOTHING I have ever tried to digest. Gave up about 3/5 of the way though. Many fundamentals are outdated and not applicable to 2011 gambling and the age of Offshore Books and ""The Internet"" for news and information. Horrid writing style."
3,A house inside my mommy- not as gender neutral as I'd hoped...,"I loved the idea of this book- it is very cute and well written. I just REALLY wished the author had made it more gender neutral- It's obviously a book about a boy who is expecting a little brother (even though they initially say they don't know what gender the baby is)- ordinarily I would just substitute ""sister"" or ""her"" (since we are expecting a girl) in for the masculine terms, but because of all the rhyming it makes it extra difficult... I think even my almost 3 year old pics up on me stumbling over the words to make it ""fit"" our family. So if you have two boys- great book- if you're expecting a girl- plan on being creative! :)[...]"
2,Didn't like the text,"I enjoyed the rhyming nature of this book and the pictures. But, the content of the text seemed to frighten our two year old. I think the last line is something about the mother being his ""mother until she has another"" (baby)... worked better without the words."
2,Lazy Author Didn't Do The Research,"The book is entertaining but the author (or editor, not sure who really to blame) didn't do any research before printing a lot of the stuff. For example Ghost Mountain does exist in Bucks County, however it is no where NEAR Sellersville. The person who provided the information was probably from Sellersville, but you can be assured there is no mountain of any size in the tiny boro that has to borrow it's police department from bordering Perkasie. In fact it's mailing address doesn't even provide coverage large enough to even try and claim that as the mistake.There's a lot more that most any Pennsylvanian can easily prove incorrect but I think you already get the point.Is the book insteresting? YesDoes it provide some factual information? Yes there is some.Should you take everything in it with a grain of salt? Definitely.Not bad for if you are bored but pick it up at your library. Not worth the money in my opinion."
2,"Would have been better titled ""Ghostbusters - Pennsylvania Edition""","I ordered this book after reading a brief review of it in my local newspaper. From the review, I understood the book to contain odd Pennsylvania history, traditions, and locations--interesing and humorous items. I ordered it blindly, which was my own mistake. Upon receving the book, I was disappointed to see that much of the content focuses on the supernatural--something that I have no interest in. Unfortunately, the newspaper review made no mention of that."
2,I can't believe Pennsylvania can be this boring,"I love the Weird Books. I wanted to love this one as well, but the book was as boring and dry as driving through the state on Interstate 81. Is it the state that's boring or is it the authors writing about the state? I'm going with the author on this one because I can't believe the entire state of Pennsylvania is made up of satanic cults, the amish, various tidbits about the quakers, coal, and William Penn. The little sidebits written in by people of have sent in the stories?? Most of them have satanic cults on the mind. Not a one of them had a clear thought between them. I;m sorry to say you would get better stories sitting around a boy scout campfire."
3,My Opinion,"Weird Pennsylvania was interesting, but not what I was looking for. I thought it would be more about haunted places in the state."
4,2 thumbs up,If you like local history or just want to read about some oddities the weird series does not disappoint.
1,"Bad writing, silly stories","A friend lent me this book. I was looking for interesting places to visit in PA. This is not a useful book for that.The stories are not researched. Similar stories can be found in any mediocre book of ghost or weird stories. Nothing about the book is ""Pennsylvania."" How many books have stories about spontaneous combustion? What makes this a PA story? Stories about large fish? How is that PA?There is a story about a cemetery on Blue Myst road related by Anonymous. There is no other information about the location of the cemetery. There is nothing PA about this story. Sure, it's local lore, but local to whom?I'd enumerate some of the writing faux pas, but you don't care. The problem with too many books is that people read them and don't like them but don't know why. It's because of the bad writing. This book is afflicted by bad writing.I am glad I got a chance to look at this book before investing any money."
4,A Good Read-Much different than other HH books,"I really enjoyed this book. Though not as informative as I would have liked, it gave an insight into Howard Hughes ranging from mildy compassionate to sadistic. The books expands from focussing exclusively on Hughes to highlighting the adverse affect of Hughes actions on Ron and his family. The surprising thing was Ron gets sentimental even after he was treated so poorly by his employer, but, it gave you an essence of how captivating Hughes was to anyone who came into contact with him."
3,I Caught Flies for Howard Hughes,"This book is a fascinating personal account of the strange, at times obsessive behaviour of Howard Hughes and the power he wielded from inside his secret world. However I did not find any of the incidents recalled amusing and certainly not hilarious."
2,war machine,This toy is from 1995 and I was unaware at the time of purchase. this was disappointing. This would have been good info to have since there are newer versions of this toy and that's what I thought I was buying
2,Crash Booster,"Given as a Christmas gift to a grandson, age 9. The product was not made very well, basically plastic and cardboard. The kids seemed to enjoy it but alas was broken by the end of the first day. Would not recommend buying."
4,Special message,"Love veggie tales and the truths they tell in ways the wee ones understand, thanks to kindles my babies are not only able to watch veggie tales in our travels, but mami can read to them also!"
3,Good for the price,"I think it delivers great performance for the price. Good color, brightness, sound. We've used it in cars with the supplied cigarette lighter adapter, in planes, and conected to a TV. It plays all DVDs we've tried on it, including DVDs made with our Panasonic DVD recorder (I noticed another reviewer was not able to do this--you've got to finalize DVDs on the Panasonic--a procedure not inuitively obvious since it's buried deep in the manual). My only complaint is that the battery only lasts about an hour and a half. I'm looking for a spare batery to remedy that problem."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this dvd player about 2 years ago and I also bought it with a case so it would be protected...or not. This dvd player is literally made out of garbage. The plastice hinges where the screen is held broke off so now it is just hanging by two wires. The compartment also broke off where the dvd is put in. Also, if you do not use the so-called ""2.5 hour"" (which at the most I can get out of it is 1.5 hours) battery within two days when you last used it, then the battery will die. Also what I've noticed is if you tap the compartment where the dvd is place in it will start the movie over, and the movie sometimes just goes blank when I'm in the middle of watching it. Bottom line is that no one should by this dvd player. You're better off with some other company that makes better dvd players."
1,Poor quality product. Buyer BEWARE!,"The hinge where the screen meets the base is very weak plastic, and after watching about 8 movies over the course of 3 months on the product it broke. Initial's customer service is a nightmare to deal with. I recommend you stick with name brands like Sony or Toshiba, who stand by their products."
1,BAD,This is awful. Don't get it. It doesn't work properly and isn't even widescreen!!! Could you believe it? Get something that can play DVD-R/RW istead!
1,4:3 Widescreen??,"Product ad copy writers who know nothing about the technology they are writing about, should be out looking for a new job. 4:3 is FULLscreen, NOT WIDEscreen. This is NOT the original format of DVDs. In fact, even the 16:9 ratio is slightly less than the typical DVD movie aspect ratio. I'm sure the people from the Initial Co. gave the product specs to Amazon, so they are the ones getting 1 star from me."
3,Good quality light weight jeans with great pocket placement.,"These jeans are a lighter weight than standard jeans. The extra pockets (3) are perfectly placed for tools, pencil, or a cell phone. The legs are roomy but not baggy. Waist sizes run about 1""-2"" smaller than other Guide Gear jeans."
1,"poor CS, and made in China","Almost rude response from them when asked about why they are not made in Japan, said not quality difference, same as always from around the world supplies.... yea right. Even tried a second time and got no reply from them. Ask anyone who knows steel and cutting edges if there is a difference and we know there can be a huge difference , even the Chinese best is no comparison to quality Japanese steel. Another example of a company, reducing their once quality product and still charging the same amount. I will stick with the Stanley 1"" snap off blades ,made in USA on in England, at least for now. they are less than $7 at BORG for a 10pk. The are razor sharp, can shave hair off skin with them."
4,Good basic game for kids under 6,"This is a very easy game and kids under 6 will learn a lot about control and following instructions but that is it. It is a good game for kids under 6 to learn the basics of how to control characters, etc but nothing beyond that. So as a starter game - buy it. For someone who knows games well- pass on it."
1,Really for the little kiddies!,"So who came up with the concept of this game. I would have expected this type of gameplay on the Gameboy, but the power of the GameCube could have been utilized more in the making of this game. You pretty much just battle as the Megazords. My son who is 5 years old doesn't even want to play the game anymore. He played it on the first day for just half and hour and got bored. He kept complaining that the game is boring and that he wanted to go back to the store to get a different game. It may be great for the kids who are just getting into video games. But it can be boring for the older kids. The game can be put to better use as a coaster for your drinks. Try before you buy!"
5,karate book,I gave this book to my granddaughter. She has not really mentioned the book. She did say her and her mom read it for her reading time. I hope she is also learning the steps too.
4,Good basic course,"I had three years of french in high school, but like everyone else, I don't remember much of it. This course is well designed in that the first cd provides a basic review, so that the words I hear sound familiar again. The second and third cds provide more of an indepth lesson on simple vocabulary and verbal grammer. The exercises in the book allows the listener to practice both the pronounciation and sentence structure of the language. The only complaint I would have is that the speakers on the cds sometimes recite too fast, and the words slur together, making it difficult for someone not proficient in the language to understand."
4,Helpful and easy to understand.,I moved to France and I did not know one word in French. I had some books with me and the Living language set. In the end it was the only thing I used and the only book I was learning from. It helped me learn the basics of the language without me having to put too much work into it.
3,One big flaw!,"Basic French course was in great condition, but was missing one of the CD's in the set."
1,Don't buy this valve,"I installed this valve in my radiator. Upon putting the coolant in I had a small drip out of the valve.I tightened the valve by hand. The handle came loose under hand pressure. Now I could not open the valve to drain the radiator, or close it to stop the drip. I had to remove the drain cock at the wrench nut because it was now worthless. Very poor design."
5,Exact replacement,"This drain cock is the exact replacement for the new radiator I just put in my 1976 Ford pickup. I couldn't find this in ANY of my local auto parts stores. It was such a good deal, bought 2 so I could have a spare."
2,What the Hell?,"It is a book that is barbaric Judo. It does not get intermediate or advanced, it is a bigginer Judo book with no technique. Little can be learned from this except how to injure a groin or poke out eyes."
5,Background information and philosopy of Kung-Fu San Soo.,"Master Greg Jones has a very solid and deep understanding of kung-fu san soo. It is evident in this well written and very articulate book on one of the most devastating martial arts currently taught to the public. Master Greg Jones ability to translate what he learned from the late Master Al Rubin into words is testimony to his knowledgable and extremely compentent training. This book will give the uninitiated to kung-fu san soo an excellent starting point on the art. This book is extremely useful for long time, experienced students of the art as a review and referrence manual. I bought this book in 1988 when it first came out, and have since read it five times. An excellent resource on the martial art of Kung-Fu San Soo!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!,"This is one of THE BEST GAMES I have ever played! It is true to the original, and has almost all of the graphics and sound effects of its arcade counterpart! The only thing that's missing is the recoil of the gun! I would recommend this to a die-hard collector of arcade-style games!"
3,"Dated, Corny, yet ADDICTIVE!","The New Order Nation is brainwashing everyone in the world and they kidnap AEROSMITH. It is up to you to destroy Helga, the leader, and rescue the band. Overall, this game is an action packed blast from the past!I am sure the other reviews on this page are ancient, but I am writing in January 2002. So today, this game is really corny, which is funny. Everytime I go the the Middle East level, I pretend that I am fighting the Taliban. Now you really know that this is 2002!!!Rescue the babes and watch out for that green-slime monster!"
1,What the...?,"I have no idea how any of those other reviewers could have liked this game. IT'S TERRIBLE! I'll sum up the plot in a few words. You're Areosmith and you're trying to stop some evil government sceme. It seems the government has sent a clone army after you because all the enemys are the same guy in a yellow suit! Also when you shoot them they don't react at all! I don't know about you but if I was shot in the face I'd at leat fall on the floor and scream like a... well, you know. Of course this makes the game extremly chalenging because it doesn't matter how skilled you are you're still going to die every few seconds. That gets really old, really fast. Choosing to continue is kind of like choosing to light your hand on fire and then hiting yourself in the face with it. No wait, that might be more fun."
2,An album that disappoints after its predecessor,"WHISPER OF A SECRET was the third album by Déanta, an Irish traditional music ensemble from Northern Ireland. Here Déanta's lineup was Mary Dillon (vocals, keyboard, guitar, harp), Deirdre Havlin (flute, whistles), siblings Eoghan (guitar, harp) and Kate O'Brien (fiddle, viola), and Clodagh Warnock (bouzouki, fiddle, bodhran, percussion) and Rosie Mulholland (keyboard, fiddle).I enjoyed Déanta's previous album,Ready for the Storm, but this isn't nearly as powerful. Mary Dillon's voice is no longer as enchanting as it was, and the performances lack fire. The appearance of Richard Buckley's soprano saxophone on ""Paddy and the Bandit"" and the final track gives the album horrible smooth jazz tones. ""At the Crossroads"" is a decent tune, but I find it hard to recommend this album even to committed fans of Irish traditional music."
5,Really cute,"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas, she loves it. Seems pretty sturdy and easy to assemble."
4,Lots of fun,My 5 year old daughter loves this vanity and it's a nice size for her. It's so cute and girly. It was easy to put together. The only bad part is that the little drawer falls out easily.
4,Enchanted,My 3 year old granddaughter loves it. She's a little diva so this is perfect for her. She's into 'make believe I'm Mama' so she spends a lot of time playing. Worth ever penny!
5,Granddaughter Loves It!,"Purchased this for my Granddaughter.This item seemed to be very durable and made with no sharp edges or corners.My Granddaughter thinks she is a ""big Girl"" since she has her own make up vanity."
4,My daughter is in Love with it!!,"My 3 year old daughter is just in love with this vanity or as she calls it ""the haircut place"" ever since I took her to get her first haircut at the salon this year she saw one in the toy ads and just had to have her own haircut place. Well, THANK YOU SANTA you are her new best friend!!!!"
5,Very happy!!,"Bought this for my daughters, 5 and 3. They love it. It's very durable and the mirror is great. It's also nice having the storage bench!If you're looking for one, this is it. I'm very pleased."
3,Light didn't work,"My 4 yr old daughter got this for Christmas this year and she loved it. It was very easy to assemble. The lid on the seat does not stay on very well, but she adjusted. The only bad thing I have to say about this vanity is that the light bulb did not work. She doesnt seem to mind. However it bothers me since I bought it and expected it to work."
4,Daughter loves this,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I was fairly easy to put it together and looks very cute. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because first I don't care for the stool. She got on it and fell right off a minute later. I'd much rather have a chair like he ones that come with the step2 desk (We have been using that one til she can figure the stool out alittle more.) Also The nob on the drawer looks cheap. I don't know exactually how to explain it but on a dresser normally you put the nob on the front and a screw in the back well this you put the nob threw a hole and screw it in. Works, I don't have to worry about my daughter knocking it off and sticking it in her mouth but it doesn't look that good either. Other than my small complaint I love this thing and my daughter does to."
4,great item,"Good solid piece, unlike many vanities I saw in stores. My daughter is 4 yrs ,40 lbs and tall and it works great. Very cute with stickers and brushes/drawer. Only fault is the light is really dim. otherwise great product!"
4,Vanity table,Overall. Satisfied with this table. Except that drawer completely comes out too easily. Easy to clean too. Great for my 4yr old.
4,Fantasy Vanity,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She has been wanting a vanity and she was delighted with this one when she opened it. Dad did have a little trouble with putting it together but I'm sure it was more from being tired from all the holidays and travel, not the vanity."
4,Vanity Review,"Our daughter (3.5 years old) received this from Santa for Christmas. She LOVES it. It's been the hit of Christmas. She plays with it as soon as she gets up in the morning and off and on all day long. Great buy. Wish it had a little more storage...like if the stool had storage inside it. Otherwise, excellent gift!"
4,Surprised at how much we love it!,"I found this used at a local Goodwill, and I got it because the price was right. I probably wouldn't have gotten it from the store, but now I know that I'll replace it if anything ever happens to this one. It's worth getting at regular price (even better on sale!), and I'm glad we didn't miss out on having one!My little girl uses this:-To store items in the drawer, sometimes to hide them from her little brother who hasn't noticed the drawer yet-To pretend to put make-up on-To eat her snack-To color on (placing thicker crayons in the lipstick spots on the vanity)-To set up her My Little Pony toys and other toys to display themIt gets more use than any of our other Step 2 (or Step 2-ish) items."
3,Adequate,"I got this vanity for my daughter's 2nd birthday. My husband put it together; there was more assembly required than I would have thought. The light bulb in the light was loose and had to be adjusted. Overall, the assembly took about 15-20 minutes. My complaints about this product are that the mirror scratches very easily and that the lid on the stool does not stay on very well when my daughter tries to sit on it. Also, it only comes with a brush, comb, and hand mirror, so you'll probably want to buy a separate accessory set for your child. My daughter likes playing with this vanity, and her enjoyment is more important than my annoyances with it. This is a decent simple vanity for a young child."
5,"so precious and my daughter loves it, it is worth every penny","my daughter got this for christmas 06' and she loves it i have looked at walmart and toys r us..and this was cheaper on amazon so i got it.. i am so glad i did ,it is made very strudy and the best part is it has storage in the chair the pink lid comes off and you can put alot of stuff in there also the draw pulls out for storage..the light above mirror comes on and it even came with the comb , brush and hand held mirror.this has got to be the most best made vanity and the best priced ...it will last for ever.."
3,its not like the picture,"I like the overall build of the vanity. It seems to be durable. Howvere, the light is not very bright and the mirror has a cloudy look to it. My daughter can barely see her reflection. I am very disapointed. It does not look like the picture of what the box portrays,"
3,Great toy but came with the wrong chair!,"I really liked how durable and fun this toy is! However, I decided on this vanity because of the storage the chair had in the original picture and in the description. I'm VERY disappointed that I didn't get what I paid for!"
3,"""Greatest Hymns"" shouldn't be revised . . .","In an effort, I suppose, to update these classics, Pat Boone has changed ""thee"" and ""thine"" to ""you"" and ""yours"" wherever possible in these hymns, making them sound awkward. (Case in point: the hymn entitled ""I Need Thee Every Hour"" is sung ""I Need You . . .""!)"
1,Way too expensive for 2 oz.,"It's not ""gold plated"". It's too expensive for 2 oz. They want almost $10.00 for shipping to boot! I bought 6 oz., 3 times that amount for less than what they want for 2 oz from Swanson's, and they charge $5.00 for shipping total for all you want to buy on your order."
1,Scam! It is only 5 songs and 1 disc.,"It is a lie/cheat!!!Do not buy!!Amazon says it has 14 songs, IT DOES NOT!It is suppose to be 2 disc. IT IS ONLY 1It only has:This Everyday loveThen I didI'm movin onhere's to youFeels like today"
4,My nephew loved it!,Out of all the toys he got for Christmas he played with this one first for the longest! My nephew is 5 years old and this was a huge hit for him. He's really into dinosaurs and trucks right now so this was the best of both worlds. It was a bit smaller than I expected but a nice size to be pushed around on the floor but a smaller child.
2,"Smaller than I expected, it's a truck with a dinasour head.","I bought this as a gift for our 3-year old nephew, as it combined his interests in dinosaurs and toy trucks. Honestly I was a bit disappointed when the toy arrived, as it was smaller than I expected (note that the size is not listed in the description). All in all it was as described: a toy truck with a triceratops head. But it was small and rather unimpressive, and I think was eventually ignored by our nephew for his other toys."
4,Good showcase of chinese instruments from classic to jazz,"I first came across this CD on George Gao's own website... You can hear some excerpts there. Although Gao plays the erhu (the two-string Chinese fiddle), this CD has many excellent showcases of the Chinese flute. There was also one very memorable vocal in 'Birds in a Foreign Land' and wished there were more. Overall, it's a good hodgepodge of different styles from the very traditional to Gao's own compositions. ..."
3,"Good, not great.","I bought this CD because of the song, ""Fico Assim sem Voc"" for my girlfriend's birthday.This song is really great in this CD, and I could not find it anywhere else.I like one of two of the other songs as well.But keep in mind that most of the songs are for kids."
3,"Good Product, but useless directions","Overall the product looks like a typical high standard Westin product. Then you get to the directions and it is a different story. Not only full of spelling errors and bad grammar, but; missing steps, useless pictures, missing tool info, and horrible listed steps. I basically used the picture on the box, and deduction to get it installed. And Westin did not include the TORX head driver, that most people will not have- I happen to have the right size. Westin should be thorough;y embarrassed.Note some models require an additional bracket, that you find out about later- but no instructions ar steps on where it goes and how to install.Bad Westin, Bad."
3,"I read it, but I didn't really enjoy it","This book is a bit overwrought when it comes to language and a bit short when it comes to plot and character development. I did finish the book, but I can't say that I really enjoyed it. The whole exercise seemed a bit formulaic and not terribly well written."
4,Antiques to Die For,"Jane K. Celand's CONSIGNED TO DEATH has flaws, but the introduction to Josie Prescott keeps you turning pages. Any reviewer likes to see a mystery series devoted to their profession and here is where I found the flaws.Josie's very high end merchandise is way out of our price range, but her constant use of the word, ""yeah"" for ""yes"" is irritating. We have been in the business for over thirty years and we've never heard a dealer use that when answering someone. We're reading the series out of order and didn't notice this in KILLER KEEPSAKES. Others have mentioned the constant waterworks, etc.Still, this is a fun read, either for the mystery/suspense or the antiques.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
2,Tiresome Heroine,"Loved all the insider information about the antiquities market and estate resolutions. Loved the plot. I couldn't stand the heroine who cried every three pages and quoted her dead father every other one. I am going to try one more in the series but if the main character does not stop whining and sniveling and telling us what ""her Father would have said,"" that will be it for me."
2,"Great premise, ordinary execution","I was attracted to this book by the hook of having the heroine, Josie, be an antiques dealer, as I've worked in the field myself. It's a perfectly fine book for a quick light read, but Josie turns out to be a Standard Female Cozy Heroine: feisty, but a little shaky to be on her own (see ""dead daddy""); widely beloved by employees and customers, except for those who are obviously evil; modest and never vain; home in a quaint New England town; a great cook; and attracted to the detective who investigates her as a murder suspect. The plot quickly veers from ordinary antiques into a specialized subfield that could have worked with many other heroines, and as others have noted, there's no true denouement. And by the time the murderer is revealed, the answer is so obvious that it's a wonder Josie didn't see it coming."
3,Needs an editor,"This novel is missing a layer or two. We need to feel the story more. I'm willing to read another by this author because I think she has potential, but this first one missed the mark. Make us care more."
3,Consigned to Death,"I thought I would enjoy Consigned to Death, the first book in the Josie Prescott Antiques series, as I like theme of antiques. The antique business information was the best part of the book. However, the book was quite slow for me. The second page of the book had the police officer at Josie's workplace to question her about a murder of a client. Josie had a appointment with the client that morning but he did not answer the door. There was not much action from that point on. The biggest drawback back for me was Josie constantly quoting her decreased father. It really was too much and quite irritating. I doubt if I will read the second book in the series. At first, I thought I would try the next book but by the end I was glad to finish this book."
3,Mildly enjoyable read.,"I enjoyed this book and did not want to miss the outcome, but I tired of the main character's incessant crying and her abnormal fixation on her 4-years-dead father. Scarcely a page went by without waterworks or WWDD (""what would Daddy do?"") musings. The ending was rather anticlimactic, just telling the reader who the culprit was with no exciting showdown or suspenseful wrap-up. The constant hints of romantic tension between the main character and the police chief culminated in nothing but a possible date in the unwritten future. I enjoyed the discussions of the antiques business and the characters that the author gave some development instead of just description were likable. I'd love to see a sequel with a bit more refinement."
5,Dirt Devil Vac Bags,"A harder to find item, came as described in a timely manner. A good price and a perfect answer to an annoying problem! No more running all over town looking for Type F bags!"
5,Hard to find - NOT! (at Amazon that is),These bags are almost impossible to find in stores these days but not at Amazon. They are a prefect fit for my trusty old Dirt Devil and to top it off a great value. If you need Type F bags you can't go wrong here.
4,"interesting packaging, otherwise no problems","the dirt devil vacuum bags come in packs of 3, so to make 10 they put in an extra vacuum bag, non-packaged. strange, but otherwise no problems."
5,Works just fine,"These are a generic (not brand name) replacement filter, but other than needing a little push to seat properly, perform just as well as the name brand filters."
1,Waste Of Time,"Can not believe this was allowed to be sold. I thought there might be some ""Tips for buying Web banners"". Oh well."
2,huh?,"really bad, and I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said...more like an SF book for pre-teens. Is this the same Pohl I remember reading years past?"
3,He has done better,"This book is readable, but it's no ""Gateway"". Mr. Pohl gets too cute a bit often. Buy this book ""used"" if at all possible. On the other hand, his note at the end is fairly amusing when you consider the changes in our understanding of black holes since he wrote ""Gateway""."
2,If you join me I'll then transport you to splendid selection of interesting Core planets .. not,"I have just finished this book and put it down with a big yawn. There is a mix of characters and points of views, introducing of new characters (sometimes interesting as Marc Anthony), boring the reader with other characters even the author seemed to be no longer interested in after some chapters, and a very unsatisfactory solving of open threads (Wan). The Heechee parts are amusing and have the old Gateway feeling but that is pretty much all that is left from novels 1-3. And the endless obsessions about food might be amusing in the beginning but is soon getting really boring.All in all this seems more a sum of sketches and scenes hold together by some strained plot than a decent book as we know and can expect from F. Pohl."
2,Aimless novel,"I was quite excited to find this book at the local bookstore a couple of weeks ago. The previous four ""Gateway"" novels are among my favorite SF novels, with inventive aliens, interesting characters and strong plotting. In marked contrast, ""The Boy Who Would Live Forever"" is an aimless ramble that adds nothing to our knowledge of the Gateway universe, its characters, or anything else. One example will suffice. In ""The Annals of the Heechee,"" we get a chunk of information about the Foe. They are interesting and worth exploring further. So, in this novel, we get about 3 pages with the Foe, in a completely unbelievable situation, and then the Foe never turn up again! This novel is tedious and uninteresting, and fans of ""Gateway"" should ignore it and pretend that the series ends with ""The Annals of the Heechee."""
2,Are you kidding me Pohl?,"Pohl should have stopped after Rendezvous. I thought Annals of the Heechee was bad with all of its Albert-explaining-the-concepts-from-the-first-3-books filler but this is too much. The filler in this book (At least the first half or so) comes in the form of extremely detailed and tedious descriptions of virtual intelligence making virtual food in a virtual environment. I could have taken delving into that concept once but man, Pohl just keeps on with it.Another thing he just keeps on with are the sex scenes. He is like a 13 year old boy with this garbage.As far as the actualy story in this novel: It's alright. I think it would almost be better if this was read after Rendezvous and before Annals. (Not that I would actually recomend reading anything after Rendezvous really)"
5,Begin your journey to health,"This is a great book to read if you are looking for information about how to use noni in your daily life. He provides a good history about noni, where it comes from and what was the original company to bring noni to the market. Dr. Solomon talks about other things that are also very important to your health like diet and exercise. He also talks about the latest cancer research being done on noni and a survey on how people were helped using it for arthritis, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, diabetes and several other health problems. If you were only given one choice of a noni book to buy this is it."
1,Noni Juice Also Cures Guillibility,"Dr. Neil Solomon not only lost his license, but is also under an agreement to never practice medicine or give medical advice, so now he pushes quack cures like Noni Juice which is distributed via the internet and through multi-level marketing.More than likely, all the positive reviews of this book were written by independant noni distributers who got sucked into the MLM scheme.Solomon is actually the official physician of the ""International Noni Communicatiion Council"" and is hardly an impartial scientist.This is a promotional pamphlet for a noni marketing board promoted by noni salespeople. It has zero medical or scientific merit."
3,"a little large, a little tacky","Be careful if your desk isn't fairly large because this takes up a good amount of space. In addition I thought it looked a little cheap or tacky, not something I wanted on my desk every day. I ended up replacing it with a Kensington Monitor Stand Plus - also not perfect but for me a better choice."
3,Not wide enough,"I bought this want something to give me more desk space. This did not work because my keyboard would not slide underneath. I sent this one back and ordered the Fellowes Office Suites Large Riser. It was exactly what I needed.The material is sufficient if you are not going to be moving it around a lot. I had no complaints there. It is plastic, but a hard plastic that does look professional."
5,Great item!,I purchased two risers for two monitors in my office. They are perfect for my needs and even provide extra storage for pens and pencils.
4,shampoo with tea tree and more,"This is the second brand of tea tree shampoo I have tried. I have itchy scalp, so far this shampoo helps, but not to a point that it eliminates the itchiness completely. Since it's not a medicine, I don't expect it to be a miracle-take-the-itch-away shampoo."
1,Imposter,This is not the same Paul Mitchell product I have been using for years. I am concerned about the strong chemical smell. I compared it to the salon bought product and it is not the same. This should be investigated.
5,familiar hinge,I have used these before so I knew they worked well.If you want a knife hinge which is also self closing this is a good one.
2,Slow gameplay and loading times,"Horribly slow loading times and no feature to skip thru games you have folded on? Like watching paint dry at times. Althought there are some nice characters in the game ... the load times and poker basics have not been polished in this game.I also bought WSOP and although it's not as flashy, the gameplay experience is much better. Do yourself a favor, ignore Howard ... He's bluffing, when he says this one's good."
4,Hitler's Bunker Days,"This film bring out some interesting aspects of Hitler's final days, such as the role of Albert Speer."
1,The Bunker,I like Anthony Hopkins and enjoyed him in films like The Bounty which itself was not a great film remake and in Silence of the Lambs. He seems unsuited for this film in his portrayal of Adolf Hitler. Perhaps I was somewhat disappointed in this film after watching the better portrayal of Hitler's last days in the movie Downfall. So if you enjoy movies about Hitler and Nazi Germany then I'd recommend leaving this film buried in the bunker and watch the well done Downfall.
3,An interesting glimpse into the collapsing Third Reich.,"For my money, Anthony Hopkins as Hitler beats his movie rivals into a cocked hat. Good backup from convincing portrayals of Borman and of Goebbels, although the script does not really reflect the villainy of any of the trio as they contemplate death a little too calmly in the Bunker. Albert Speer gets off very lightly in this movie as the minister hero who plans Hitler's murder and torpedoes his scorched earth policy. There are some factual errors which are unfortunate as the movie poses as a semi documentary. Eva Braun's brother was almost certainly shot for treason, not hanged, and it is untrue Hitler never left the Bunker after January 1945 - he visited the Oder front in March. The film's emphasis on electricity and water shortages in the Bunker actually enhances the movie's theme that Hitler's vision of empire is shattered."
2,read the book,Those who have read the book will be very disappointed in this movie adaptation. The movie ends long before the book and the movie totally dismisses the infamous breakout of the bunker personnel after the Hitler/Braun/Goebbels suicides. This was the really new material that could have made this movie much better than the Alec Guiness version (Hitler: The Last Ten Days). An excellent movie could be done on the breakout and the lives of those involved immediately after the Russian pillage of the bunker.
5,The Bunker Hits the Mark,Historical accurate.Follows the book by James O'Donnell most closely.A must for anyone interested in World War II.
4,The Bunker,"Anthony Hopkins is a fine actor who puts in another good performance. The movie itself is what it is a 1980's TV drama about insane people in an insane regime, who started a world war,then destroyed themselves in the end"
5,Hopkins great in this movie,"I can understand why Sir Anthony Hopkins won an award for his portrayal of Adolf Hitler. Considering when this movie was made (back in the 1970s) it gives not only details of Hitler's last days in Berlin, but Hopkins provides viewers with a clear idea of the state of mind Hitler was in as his evil empire was crashing down before him."
4,Great acting by Anthony Hopkins,"Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler. He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions. My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent. The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story. For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film. It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer. The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen. But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning."
5,"A Hopkins, Hauer Master Peice!!!","I have studied the Third Reich and Nazi History for over 15 years now and this film is one of my most favorites! The only other Film that comes even close is Inside The Thrid Reich, with Derek Jocobi!! This is a wonderful film, A MUST SEE for all WWII buffs!!"
3,Lacks tone and atmosphere,I haven't seen the whole thing yet but what I've noticed so far is that it lacks tone and atmosphere. I've seen more tone and atmosphere in an episode of Private Benjamin or Bosom Buddies. Downfall is a better depiction of this subject matter.
2,Pass on this one.,"Anthony Hopkins does a stereotypical job as Hitler, but everyone else in the film was obviously British playing like Germans. If you are an actor and hired to act like a German soldier, then act like a German soldier and not like a Brit impersonating a German soldier.Nothing new historically in this film. Just a rehash of previous films."
3,"less interesting than her ""Fast flower arranging"" book","I guess the ""fast flower arranging'"" book is really more worth buying than this one. You will find the same great tips but the arrangements will be more appealing than the ones shown in The complete guide to flower arranging."
2,Just not very good,This book is very well illustrated but then it just goes down hill from there. I didn't find the information it gave very useful and there just wasn't very much content to the book. This is the first flower arrangement book I've bought and I've only had it a day and I'm looking for a new and better one! Good Luck.
2,Arrange like a florist--not necessarily a compliment!,"While this book is nicely photographed, well-organized and easy to follow, the focus is very controlled arrangements. Because I prefer the more natural, ""just picked from my garden"" look, this book did not appeal to me."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The book is beautiful and for someone that already knows flower arranging it would serve as good inspiration. I was looking for the photos yes, but also step by step instructions so I could learn basics not become a pro, but just get fundamentals on how to make arrangements and this book didn't provide that. It'll serve as a good coffeetable book and eventually for a yard sale item. The title ""Compete Guide to Flower Arranging"" is not quite what the content is."
5,Flower Arranging,"Thid book is really good. It has a lot of pages with arrangements with dried and live flowers among other things. Almost every page teaches or shows how to make something wonderful using different styles, techniques, and different flowers. You really get your money's worth with this book."
3,Exactly what I expected,"When you've been in this business for a while, the floral design business that is, nothing really shocks you anymore.This is a decent coffee table book, nice pictures but nothing more really. It can not teach you anything, it can not give any ideas that you haven't already seen somewhere else."
3,alot of dried flowers,"it had alot of dried flowers in it and to me seemed outdated and not fresh ideas but for the used book price, its worth that it did have some tech. on tying , bouquets and the arrangements did say how many flowers used, had two pages on wiring stems, and showed a grid and the flower placement that was nice, how to make one bow that was awful! but it does have a few good pages in it."
4,Good idea book!,"I'm always so impressed with original flower arrangements, but, had no idea how to re-create them. This book gives some practical tips on how to group flowers."
3,flower2,enjoyed book was very helpful just wished for more information. Seemed a little outdated and reasources limited.
4,Complete Guide to Flower Arrangeing,"The book is very good. However, I am not so sure if some of thefoliage and flowers used will last for 2-3 days."
1,Warps easily and quicly,I put a set of these on a Ford Windstar and they warped almost immediately causing pedal pulsations. Had them retrued and they warped again. Don't buy this brand.
4,My son wasn't as impressed as I thought he would be,"Although my 21-month old loves pop-up and lift the flap books and books with animals, he wasn't as impressed with this as I expected he would be.The text is very simple (almost non-existant!), the pop-ups are impressive, but my son only started enjoying this book a bit more once I started making some relevant animal noises. Still, this is not one of the books he'll pick up to 'read' on his own.I would recommend 'Where is Spot' instead of / in addition to 'Dear Zoo'"
3,I Already Knew This,"This book tells me it is okay to grieve and it does it very well. The problem is I already knew it was okay to grieve because I was grieving - terribly. I wanted to find out how to deal with my grief. I read a lot of reviews and a lot of books, but the only books that worked for me were Will Fido Be in Heaven and Cold Noses by the pearly gates."
4,Wonderful!,"This is definitely a different album. Wolfstone combines many musical styles to form a unique sound. But it's worth buying if only for ""Gillies"" alone -- a beautiful, powerful, addictive song."
3,Beware fragile drawstrings,"I was happy to buy these ""eco-friendly"" bags, but disappointed to find out that the drawstrings pulled out with even the slightest amount of pressure. The bag itself seems perfectly adequate - no tears or leaks, etc. Too bad. It's back to one of the mainstream brands for me, for now."
1,Synthetic Chemical Scent,"As I've posted on the other listings for this product. I have no issue with the quality and have used and promoted Seventh Generation for years and years. But when I opened my recent box of these trash bags, there was a chemical perfume-like scent that was offensive. I'm trying to get the chemicals out of my home and thought that Seventh Generation was on my side. Have to question the thinking behind the switch from unscented. Until they switch back, I have to pass on this product."
2,Weak walled,"I love seventh generation in other products but these bags have very weak walled and tear easily. Also, since they are not draw string it is difficult to tie them up with just the twist ties."
2,STUPID string,The string rips too easily. When you try to lift it with only the strings it stretchs and gets so thin that it hurts!
5,Outstanding horror novel,"This is a very original and a very under-rated horror novel, which should find a much wider audience. The cover of the book does not do any justice fot it, but Zebra is famous for this. The saying ""Never judge a book by its cover"" is a perfect example here. The story takes place in two parts: 50,000 years ago and in the present. A Megistotherium - the largest known carnivore ever to walk, possessed by an ancient evil entity, preys upon all the living creatures and prehistoric tribe living at that time. United with despiration, the tribe seals the monster in his hideout, using magical stones. In the present, three grammar school girls release the creature from its imprisonment, thus bringing horror to the people living in the nearby community. Great story, great characters, great writing. A book well-worth searching for, buying and reading."
3,"Somewhat outdated edition, not enough charts","This is an extremely comprehensive review of almost everything related to boating that existed in the Keys in 2005. And those are the problems. It provides way too much information for short term cruisers and a lot of it is quite dated. While I enjoy Mr. Young's writing style, this book is hard to use when cruising down to the Keys. Other than the publication age, and it may be that the authors are planning an update, this book may be better suited for those who are planning to spend a few months or more in the area."
3,Somewhat useful.,If you've been sailing very long and have much experience you will not find this book of much help in the Keys.
2,Bye bye Rock n Roll,"Went to the store too possible buy this CD,but after hearing a few tracks I was dissapointed.It sounded very bluesy,jazzy nothing like Pavoline 7.I bought and thought it was great ,and eagerly awaited the next album,logging onto their site to get any hint of a new release.But unfortunately I will not be adding to my collection of Paladins work."
1,Big let down...,"Wow, what a difference 2 years can make. I thought I was so-so about Palvoline, but this latest effort really hits bottom, and hard. What were these guys thinking any way? The sound quality suffers the most, then followed by the songwriting. Recycled melodies and licks have bloated this CD beyond words.Bit of advice guys quit while you're ahead or go back to the person who did your last 2 CDs."
1,Complete Fluff,"This book is a verbatim regurgitation of some dog training classes conducted by the author. NO SOLUTIONS are put forward from which readers can learn or apply to their own situations...Unsure about the credentials of the author, as sometimes he claims to be a ""Dr."", other times not, and certainly no reference as to what his real training (if any) is. No documentation or curriculum vitae is available despite searching."
5,THE HITCHHIKER IS A GREAT CREEPY TV SHOW!!!!!!!!,When The Hitchhiker came on in the 80's i was totally hooked on this tv show!!!!! It's cool that it came out on two volumes on dvd so that way you can relive all those classic horror tales!!!!! What made it creepy was the music and the stories and it had a great cast to play the parts in the stories so go and get them in your collection now!!!!!
1,Worst volume of the show.,"This is by far the worst of this series. I own all three volumes, which one and three are good. Some of the storylines did not make much sense and were quite boring. Everyone's taste is different, so this may appeal to some. For me, I could have saved my money. I am glad I paid $8.95 instead of over $20.00 for this not so good volume."
3,Disappointed Einsteins Fan,"Sort of dissapointed in this toy. Too small, pieces are too big for the set they came in and our granddaughter has not touched it since the day we got it."
4,Super cute!,"I used this on Halloween- my only gripe is that it was hard to unscrew the part that allows you to put the batteries in. Besides that, it was great!"
4,Great toy,This completed the costume for my 6 yr old. She was the Statue of Liberty and the costume wasn't complete without the torch. She got so many compliments on Halloween. The torch was very bright as well.
2,Paper Cards,"Maybe I do not know what plastic coat means , but these cards are made from paper...very disappointed either by my lack of knowledge or someone else's lying. So if you looking for plastic cards ...these cards are NOT ."
3,Item was fine for the cost,These were the cheapest cards I could find to hand out for Halloween. The quality was good. The kids were happy and they were a good quality for kids and for the price. However not top of the line and tended to feel more cardboardish rather then plastic. I do not think the cards would last as long as a more expensive deck.
