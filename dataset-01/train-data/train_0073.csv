5,great,I had been looking for a pill case like this for a long time and finally found one that I was happy with! delivery and order were a breeze. thanks.
1,Not worth the money,I purchased 2 of this item thinking that it was a great idea to get medications organized. The items arrived and was very disappointed with the quality. It was so poorly designed that the tiny latch which keeps the container closed doesn't work at all. What a total waste of money. Its a cheap piece of plastic not worth the $7+ asking price. Don't be fooled.
3,Professional novelization lacks fear.,"This novelization of the second film in the omen series is a professional job, it just isn't that scary (a problem the film it's based on had as well). It was also written by Joseph Howard, not David Seltzer as listed above. Fans of the series will want to search for it anyway, for there are minor differences in the story that will no doubt be of interest."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The sequels, unfortunately and not unsurprisingly do not live up to the original.As far as The Omen series goes, stopping at one will generally do you, no need to get this book."
3,Not the best of the run,"Like other comic junkies, I gobbled up this series (at least in trade form...). I really enjoyed the series overall, but not this one. Yes, it's an epic battle to save Opal from the bad guy.MILD SPOILER:But the bad guy was invented for this plot line, not an old villain returned or anything clever, and I HATE that trick. Why not *really* make Shade the bad guy? Robinson also brings in WAY too many side characters, and takes a long time to tell this story (back story is fine, but it can be overdone). For example, Adam Strange's appearance could have omitted and the story wouldn't have suffered.You could stop reading Starman with book 8."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"You get what you pays for, with this title. Big fight, and dead people, brought about by plotting and scheming, with the Shade-powers, Jack, and the local hero-cop family in the middle.Opal City is a wonderful looking place, but now is the time it really needs its heroes. You know what Guignol in the title is going to mean, as well."
2,buyer beware,"I bought this book after purchasing the author's other cookbook, Cooking at the Natural Cafe in Santa Fe, without knowing that the books are 99% the same. Same number of pages, same recipe titles (I didn't check to see if any ingredients were changed as too time consuming). This edition actually has dropped some of the drawings. Only the bibliography is longer by half a page. If you already have the previous cookbook, you don't need this one. Shame on the publisher for repackaging a previous book under a new title and not saying so where it can be noticed."
2,New Age Mangione,"This 1986 release is a far cry from the inventive, musically-satisfying Mangione of the early 70s. BUT having said that, there's no denying that Mangione has a talent for melody invention. And he seems to surround himself with sidemen who are likewise ""melody-sensitive"". This time he's teamed up with producer/co-songwriter Morris ""Butch"" Stewart. Some tracks sound like vintage Mangione of the late 70s, while others - ""hip-hop Mangione?"" - make one wonder WHO thought THIS would be a good idea? All in all this is a recording worth having in the collection if you're of fan of CM back to the days when he was credible. It presents the Rise and Fall of an artist; even so, you still end up whistling some of those tunes!"
3,Just Another Mangione 80's Album!!!!!!!!!,"Just about every album by Mangione in the 80's had at least one song that made the album worth wild!!!! For instance:Disguise:Shirley McClaneJourney To A Rainbow: the title trackLove Notes: To The 80'sand so on.With this cd, it is Rockin At Red Rocks, and Save Tonight For Me.This is a wierd album, and curtainly doesn't live up to Feels So Good, and Fun And Games, but it is a fun thing to listen to. It may be discouraging to a new listener, but after years of listening to it, you still wont like it!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Got Whisked Away......And.....,"This whisk is large at 11.5"" in length. Oxo manufacturers solidily crafted kitchen utensils, but unfortunately this utensil does not fit into that category. The soft non stick handle fits into various sized hands nicely, but the nylon balloon whisk part is not that sturdy, it feels that it would eventually break after numerous uses. Again, previously bought two other Oxo products and highly recommended those, but would not recommend this particular Oxo utensil."
2,Buy a Metal Whiks and Better Cookware,"I didn't think I could use a metal whisk on my Circulon Pots but Customer Service told me that yes I can.Good thing, becuase I bought this whisk and it is weak. Metal chisk works much better."
3,Wish I had known,"The hole in the handle is great for hanging, the handle is comfortable for my large hands, the whisk is lightweight and it works.The cons are: it is ""top heavy"" and falls out of the bowl if I rest it against the sides and the ridges at the bottom of the handle are impossible to clean - I use this mostly for eggs and pancakes and I need a small brush or toothpick to get batter out of the small ridges at the bottom of the handle grip.I am still using this whisk as I'am very frugal but if I forget and leave it resting in the bowl after I pour the eggs in the pan it ends up on the floor- it is so light weight you don't realize that it is top heavy."
4,As good as nylon can be...,"Ideal for those of us who don't want to scratch up our non-stick pots and pans, but not as strong as a metal whisk for those with other cookware or more labor intensive applications requiring greater durability.As a bonus though the handle is standard Oxo and quite comfortable."
2,Flimsy at smallest point,"I usually like Oxo stuff, but this is an exception. The whisk is too flimsy at the point where the ""wires"" converge on the handle. Therefore, you have to hold the whisk by that part of the wires and not by the handle to keep it from flexing too much. A reinforcing circle of nylon would have solved this problem. I would not buy this again, even at the clearance price. How does something like this make it through engineering and testing?"
4,nice for use in non-stick pans,"this whisk is larger than it appears--however, it is good for use in non-stick pans and is very easy to clean"
4,Usual great OXO product,This was purchased as a gift-my daughter didn't have one that was OK for use on non-stick cookware. She was very excited to receive it.
5,"Good grip, nice size, great for breaking up lumps","It's a great whisk. The thin balloon strands are very flexible, so it won't work for really really thick things, but the thin whisk strands are excellent for breaking up lumps in thinner sauces/etc. The handle is standard OXO Good Grips fare, nice feel, thick enough to sit comfortably in your hand, and a nice soft finish. It works well, and does not scratch my teflon pans."
3,It's efficient,I have have a couple of whisks break apart from trying to stir something that was too thick. This whisk seems durable enough that it wouldn't break as easy as my other whisks but I would not recommend it to stir something that is very thick. It is good for its price.
5,"The Oxo kitchen tools are generally quite good, the whisk is no exception","Honestly, this doesn't come out all that often, but it works well, feels good in the hand and is safe with non-stick pans. Solidly built and cleans up nicely in the dishwasher. What more do you need or want in a whisk?"
2,Didn't Last Very Long,"Usually happy with Oxo products but was really disappointed with this whisk. The fact it's so lightweight makes it flimsy and difficult to use at times. The individual wires popped out after about a month of use. I didn't use it for anything heavy and wasn't applying unnecessary force. I was able to put the wires back in but they would randomly pop out again and again. Eventually it just wasn't worth the effort. Not sure if it's from something I did or the dishwasher, but it just wasn't as reliable as a strong metal whisk."
4,Good whisk,"It's a good whisk, I like OXO for their comfortable grips. It could have been a little sturdier but overall a good purchase."
2,Pain in the patooty,"Problematic. Too flimsy to do the real work of a whisk. It can only handle the lightest of ingredients, like eggs... add flour and you've got a real mess."
4,Nylon whisk,"Very good for non stick surfaces,but not good at stiff applications. overall a great product for the price."
1,Terrible Key Ring,"Wouldn't buy again, keys do not remain on ring, the ring always swings open in pocket. Extremely annoying, I don't believe dealerships sell this ring for that reason."
3,looks good..but the lock tends to come loose,"very good, exactly as advertised. good build quality and looks. but the lock where you hook your key to the chain tends to come loose sometimes, not because its faulty, but because the system where it locks is poorly designed. so far its come loose twice sending my key and the keychain to the floor. luckily i noticed that and picked them up again."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"VERY,VERY,VERY, Disappointing.I was very excited when i recieve the package,and it arrived within a couple of days.But when i opened the package i was very disappointed to see how very small it was!! I am usually not the complaing type of person, but this i had to comment on. The look is nice, but the size is just to small for the price.I purshased this key ring for my boyfriend as a X-MAS gift but i'm not sure if i should even give it to him. I would not recommend this key ring to anyone...."
4,DANES ROCKIN',"For all of you Pretty Maids fans that don't as of yet own this...get it. It was recorded a little earlier in their career so there are some newer songs missing. The crowd interaction is amazing! And although when interacting w/ the crowd, it's not in english, it doesn't need to be. You get the drift. All together....another fine Maids release."
5,Classic death metal masterpiece!,This album set the standard for all Death Metal! I haven't listen to it in 15 years. It's still as brutal today as it was then.
5,Super album,Super metal album by one of the pioneers of death metal. Dates from 1985. The sound is good. The riffs are good. Every metal-fan should have it!
4,"Have a Seiki watch, put in in storage 22 years ago.","Afrer inserting the battery, the watch started working. Now after a long storage I have a very expensive watch to use again."
4,"Yo, Ho, Ho and a bag of Affidavits","What is the relationship between lawyers and marauders? Well nowadays someone would end that with a witty punch line. But at one time they did work closely together.This is a book relating to the laws and customs of war in the age of sail especially with regard to the taking of prizes. It gives fascinating details, such as cross ocean lawsuits after hostilities(at one time their was a suit by an American privateer in a British court over the validity of a ransom promised to him), the issueing of letters of mark, and the condemnation of prey in prize courts.As might be expected in a book about legal matters it can have dry writting at times. But it also has interesting anecdotes and a great deal of information about a specialized aspect of war on the high seas."
5,California immigrant history brought to life!,Galleys and unfinished titles typically aren't mentioned here but keep an eye out for the finished version of FORGOTTEN FACES: A WINDOW NTO OUR IMMIGRANT PAST: it's a unique coverage of photo-ceramic memorial grave portraits and provides an outstanding survey of memorial portraiture as its own art form. This could have been mentioned under our art review section but is featured here for its important cultural insights as well: California immigrant history comes to life in an outstanding visual and written survey of a unique art and memorial form which should not be missed.
5,Mann Oil Filters for Lincoln LS owners,Owners of 2000 thru 2002 Lincoln LS 3.9L should take advantage of the extraordinary quality of this brand of oil filter. Will not fit 2003-2006 3.9L Lincolns due to addition of factory oil cooler. I have done extensive research on filters and some are true junk. Most junk filters will last 3K miles before the bypass opens. You will run unfiltered oil if that happens. With the trend to use synthetic oils some neglect the oil filter. There are many quality filter that can last 5000-5500 miles before needing service while using full synthentic. Avg filter pleates range from 40 to an amazing 88 on the Mann. Oil is expensive and using a junk oil filter just doesn't make sense with synthetic oils. Check the 2001 Jag S type with 4.0L. It uses the same oil filter
2,Unfortunate boring mediocrity,"As a huge Circle Jerks fan, I was extremely dissapointed in wonderful,VI and Oddities.Sure they still have that great sarcastic sense of humor.Keith Morris has his lyrics down cold and they are brilliant.Nevertheless,the music itself sounds rushed,thrown together and seriously lacking in the energy department.I found it to be very bland sounding and uninspired.I do not recommend any of their last 3 studio albums unless you are an absolute die hard and just have to have them.Stay with Group Sex and Wild in the Streets.Those are treasures."
4,Okay product,"I bought EARLY TAN in Normal/Combination Skin formula and I can tell you that it provides good coverage but not without being weighty and heavy. Some people like that. I find I can only wear it during the winter. (During the summer it makes my skin break out)I haven't noticed any moisturizing feature, although it's heavy enough that it provides some protection against the harsh winds of winter.It's a good product if you like heavier coverage.Pam T~"
1,Agree with the other reviewer....,"I must very earnestly agree with the reviewer called ""koran vs. New Testament"". I am a Jehovah's witness and I read the Greek Scriptures every day. I see Jesus as superior to Mohammad. The Koran has nothing in it to inspire and to enlighten the honorable soul. I was a Buddist and now I am a Christian and I want no more than to read the scriptures every day.I feel very very sorry for muslims who are forced to read this book each day.Thank you"
1,The movie was better.,"This book isn't entertaining in the least. The main characters are idiots and the plot sounds like something that was written hundreds of years ago. I disliked this book so much, I started drawing illustrations on random pages of what this guy ""Muhammed"" might look like. I drew him wearing a Disney World t-shirt with a propellor hat and a sign that says, ""I love the West."" I eventually got bored, (...).Not recommended. Pick up ""Where's Waldo"" instead."
3,Paperback instead of hard bakc.,I thought I had ordered the hard back version but got the paper back. I was ordering a NIV version of the bible at the same time and got the hard back version of that.
1,Mis-translation,I'm a Muslim who studied English. I find this translation to be deviant from the original text of the Quran. It's an attempt to distort the teachings of the Quran and relegate it into a hate-instigator bookshop.I don't recommend it at all.
3,"Not Bad, but there are Better","Dawood's translation was, I believe, the first one that I ever read. As I am not a Muslim, I can't judge very well on matters of interpretation, but on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd say:Accuracy - 5. Given a choice, Dawood prefers clarity to accuracy. Please understand that translating everything the Quran says, or even a small part of what it says, is impossible.Poetic Sense - 8. Dawood is really pretty good in letting some of lilt get through.Depth - 3. It's just not there.I'd probably recommend him over Pickthall, even though Pickthall was a Muslim. Pickthall was very aware of the sense behind what he was translating, and he tried to bring more of it through than could be done; he also has a bit too much baggage from the bible with him. My favorite translation is Yusuf Ali, who is interested in being as clear and accurate as possible even at the expense of elegance. If you want elegance too, learn Arabic and read the original."
1,Much Better Translations Available,"This translation leaves out text, mistranslates other text, and has no explanatory footnotes. Even Arabic speakers have trouble understanding the Koran in Arabic when there are no footnotes because, after all, not one word of the text has changed since it was compiled 1300 years ago. (Try reading Shakespeare without footnotes -- and that was only 400-some years ago!)This one is short and cheap, true, but it doesn't accurately convey what the Koran says. The best translation out there is Muhammad Asad's ""Message of the Qur'an."" Asad was a Polish Jew before his conversion to Islam, and he has great explanatory footnotes and a really accurate translation that's easy for the Western mind to understand without sacrificing meaning, as Dawood's translation does."
1,terrible translation,"don't waste your time with this terrible translation. this is a propagandistic version of the koran, aimed at giving islam a bad name. many verses are purposely mistranslated in the worse way possible. If you want a good translation, buy Quran by Yahya Emerick. or buy a translation by yusuf ali."
2,Simple style fails to convey true meaning,"NJ Dawood has a very straightforward style of translating. This makes for an easier read, but unfortunately he makes a lot of mistakes when translating the parts of the Quran that are more subtle and require a deeper understanding of the Arabic language.This becomes evident in his tranlation of some of the parables and also many of the verses that make reference to historical events. For a more accurate translation I would recommend Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin."
5,A counterpoint,"The person who so unabashedly rants about his idea of ""putting to sleep"" people who believe in the Koran, should go ahead and try reading it first before spewing forth the vitriol against a faith with no apparent reason other than his/her own blatantly bigoted view of Islam.As for the Koran being the ""the focus of hundreds of scholarly exegesis, commentaries and inane panegyrics..."", actually goes to show how much mankind has been fascinated by this piece of literature. Whether the ""focus"" was just for secular and scholastic pursuits or the promptings of faith, or simply to debunk it as ""...this unwholesome and undigestable botch..."", remains an enigma in itself.I happen to be among the ""...billion of the world's population, -- (some of which are very intelligent men and women)..."", who happens to ""...unquestionably defer..."" to the Koran as the Word of God.And I found this particular translation of the Koran to be one of the best I have read so far."
1,"don't tell us about the Koran, tell moslems about it","Having read this monstrosity, I get tired very quickly of all of the reviews trying to convince non-moslems that the Koran is a peaceful book. Don't tell US that Islam is peaceful. Start telling your fellow moslems. They are the ones that need convincing. Having read this, it seems to me that the Koran is a very violent and intolerant message. It is also anti-woman, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-jewish/christian, anti-peace. I can see clearly from reading it how followers could use it as an excuse for war. Don't tell me that Jihad means ""struggle"" and not war. I never heard of the word until moslems used it to mean war and NOT struggle. Convert your own people if Islam isn't violent."
4,Translation,"In trying to find a good translation of a classic it is absurd to find those who criticize a religious text as if they were writing a book report. The book is considered holy by much of the world, and it is for this reason that we choose to read it. The hypocracy of ignoring similar statements in the Bible, while promoting one's own political dogma is no review at all."
1,A work of fiction,"The Koran is a work of complete fiction. These words are the illiterate musings of someone who happened to be on his own (like Moses , Joseph Smith etc) when visited by the Archangel Gabriel (another fictional character where evidence of this beings existence is nil). Misogynistic, homophobic, intolerant of other faiths, totalitarian i thought, this book was created when superstition ruled. The hatred on each page drips with blood. Love, peace and compassion is rarely mentioned. I would suggest reading the skeptics koran instead. Thank goodness only a small percentage of Muslims take this book literally."
3,A Reasonable Introduction,"For those who have never looked at the Qur'an before, the Penguin Classics ""Koran"" is a good place to start. While there are better translations, this is not a bad one to get your first taste on.I have found Abdullah Yusef Ali's translation superior to this one, but that has been mostly due to contact with Muslims who seemed to think it was better.However, the Penguin one is adequate to get a good idea of what is in the Qur'an. If you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about it, this one is good, and it is cheaper than many others about."
1,"Bak. Derk-derk-Allah. Derka derka, Mohammed Jihad. Haka sherpa-sherpa. Abaka-la.","This book is much too violent and very cruel. As an infidel, I was personally horrified by its passages. However, it gives a good understanding for the conflict in the Middle East."
4,Clear reading,"I got this for Christmas one year as a gift (I had asked for it) because I am somewhat of a student of religion. I like to at least have an idea what the other religions say. So I don't necessarily read them in a ""religious"" way or as a 'religious' text. I read it as a 'novel' more than anything. Having said that, I am glad I read it. It (at least this translation) is clear reading, easy to understand, and a very good read. I, like others, don't know how good or bad the translation is as I only own this one copy. But if the main nuts and bolts of Islam are there, I will take it. I would eagerly urge anyone to read this (the Koran in general if not this one in particular) just so one can have an understanding of Islam. Most of our problems stem from ignorance, and if we take the time to listen to what others have to say, even if we do not agree with them, then perhaps this would be a better world to live in."
1,WORST TRANSLATION EVER!!!,"COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BIASED... NJ DAWOOD IS NOT A MUSLIM! BUT AN IRAQI JEW. BEST TRANSLATION IS BY ABDULLAH YUSUF ALI.The Qur'an: Text, Translation & Commentary (English and Arabic Edition)"
4,Extremely Funny (4 1/2 stars),"When I saw an ad in the newspaper when it came out, I thought""Oh no, some ""Undercover Brother"" imitation! So months later I finally decide to rent it...believe it or not, I loved it. It was witty, charming, but still had some sort of plot. Although it is not for younger children, many teens to adults,will enjoy this classic-to-be! Unfourchantly, I am unable to write a longer and more detailed review. But see these movies:(Out of 5 stars)Independence Day.....*****Undercover Brother.....**** 1/2Band of Brother's.....*****UHF.....*****The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus.....*****The Back to the Future Trilogy.....*****They Saved Hitler's Brain.....***The Aristocats.....****The Fellowship of the Ring.....*****The Two Towers.....***1/2Star Trek: 2, 3, 4"
1,WOW! -in a bad way-,"I cannot believe how horrible this movie was. There was a very mild story line. This movie just goes to show that if you combine a couple of comedians, Platinum-record selling artists and put them in a ""funny"" movie, people like myself will want to see this movie. I was surprised by the acting. Ice Cube can act! But, that didn't cut it. If you review this as a movie, it's completely horrible. There is a very thin story line. It's a 2-hour movie about ""bein' black"", ""stealin' da ATM machine from da Pakistani brotha"", and ""sellin' dad's Barbershop"". It's extremely controversial, and barely funny. People who aren't African American will have a very hard time understanding what the people in the barbershop are saying, and on top of that they definitely will not be able to connect. The only person who is mildly funny is the ""wigger"". If you want some real entertainment, well, you'd be better off without this."
5,HOW GOOD CAN YOU GET ?!,"This movie was FUN. It had two tracks runningalternately; one a kind of Laurel and Hardycomedy, the other a suspense drama.Unlike some reviews, I thought the comedypart was VERY FUNNY, but I LOVE W.C. Fields, Laurel& Hardy, Abbott & Costello slapstick, and this wasin their genre.The suspense drama concerned the modern day conflictbetween the intangible goals of meaning, honesty, anddepth of character, and the tangible goals of materialism.I am very glad that the intangibles won out in this tugof war, which made for a very happy ending; and, yes,happy endings CAN happen like this in the real world.Objections and protests to some of the dialogue inthis movie merely reflect egos vulnerable to inspection.Bill Schaefer"
3,Just ok.,"I thought the camaraderie between all the people inside the barbershop was entertaining. The whole ATM thing took away from the movie IMO.I found myself skipping many portions of this DVD to get to the good parts. When the movie takes itself too seriously,it falls apart. just make me laugh man."
3,Good but too many stereotypes,This movie was very funny at times but it was plagued with stereotypes and overused cliches. The script could have been better because I kept getting pounded over the head over and over with messages about black people improving themselves. Its OK to laugh at ourselves but the messages didn't really fit in and REALLY brought the comedy level of the movie down. There weresome good performances but some actors in this movie (not gonna name names) really need some acting lessons. Some were smirking while saying their lines (the director should have caught this). Cedric and Anthony Anderson were standouts as far as good performances
1,One of the stupidest movies of the year.,This movie is a complete waste of time.There are absolutely no good moments on here.It is horrible.Do not see this movie.Save your money.
3,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: Cedric the Entertainer; lack of obscenity in a sensible script; witty/Lowpoints: Conventional, anemic script; unnecessary slapstick sub-plot; obvious message.Conclusion: I've said it before and I'll say it again: in this day and age, one reviews films on the basis of whether or not they stand out, at least vaguely, among the perpetual fabrications of contemporary mainstream cinema. ""Barbershop"" is not offensive, has amusing developed characters (a hilarious Cedric), a good ol' story about the power of loyalty, respect and devotion, and a PG-13 stamp. Despite a redundant sub-plot involving a stolen ATM-machine and lots of dumb slapstick, ""Barbershop"" is a cozy little film that will definitely initiate a sequel, but won't resonate."
3,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"My boyfriend dragged me into seeing this movie, and I thought I was going to utterly despise it.I was pleasantly surprised though. Not jumping-out-of-my-chair-that-was-so-fantastic surprised, but enough to make me a little impressed at the intelligence some of the movie gave off. Ice Cube played a barber shop owner who didn't want his employees cursing, Cedric the Entertainer played an amusing and quite insightful old man, and several of the other characters were quite good as well. And Eve actually did a mediocre job, better than what I expected.Why only 3 stars? The plot. It was too hackneyed; way too overdone. However, I recommend it if you want a laid-back, funny, cute movie to watch."
5,Great Story,"WOW! I loved this movie. The only thing unfortunate was that the movie was a little slow. If you can overlook that, you won't regret it. It was a wonderful story."
4,Has It's Redeeming Moments,"Yeah, the humor gets a bit raw and crude at times, but overall, I liked this movie. Everyone who has been to a Black barbershop (or ANY local gathring place, with minor differences in culture and dialogue) can vouch for the accuracy. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, it's actually a nice story about people in a Chicago ghetto who, in spite of a lot of trash talking and insults, really form an unoffical family and care about each other.As for Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton's complains about this film, one of the actors in a recent interview noted that all that did was help them sell more tickets, as is often the case with controversial films."
4,The Legacy,"Great film! This is a funny film, but, this is more than a Black comedy. This is a poignant story of understanding a legacy. Calvin, protrayed by Ice Cube, is a restless young man at a crossroad, deciding what he wants to pursue in life. He is a third-generation barbershop owner running a marginal business in the community. Frustrated to achieve more in life than his Father or Grandfather, we see him as a twice-failed businessman, looking to break away from running the barbershop and being 'just a barber'. By selling the business, getting out from the debt, and starting a recording studio business, he sees this as the path to this future. But, after selling the business, he then begins to realizes what the barbershop means to the community, the influence it has on the patrons, and the role his Father and Grandfather played in helping others for the past generations. He learns that this is the legacy that was pass on to him, and we see he is proud to accept that role."
3,Alright,"The first half of the movie was on a roll that almost convinces you that this will be a very funny and enjoyable film, only then you realize the movie is still playing even when the jokes run out and the plot is stretched paper thin. I give the movie props for portraying a black male who didn't turn back to crime after getting his life together and another who realized what owning his father's shop really meant. In that sense it got away from some cliches. Still overall the movie got much more hype than it deserved mainly because of the people mentioned by Cedric's character."
5,this book will stay with you for life,"I read this book as a child and have never forgotten it. Years later I can still hear the outcasts lament:""Different is dead. Keep your feet on the Ground."""
4,Good Product but Not the Best with Crib,This product was really easy to set up. It is sturdy and serves it purpose for ensuring my son doesn't fall out of bed. He even holds onto it and tries to climb on it - so far it has held up. The only downside is that it was larger than I was expecting. Right now I am using it on a crib frame turned into a daybed. The railing covers most of the side of the bed allowing very little space for my son to climb in and out. It is my fault for not measuring the bed before ordering but I wanted to give this caution to anyone who was thinking about doing the same.
3,"Pretty good, but not stellar","Nice and sturdy. We have a little monkey who likes to climb, push her feet against the bed, etc. - and it holds up to all she's tried so far, which is fantastic. However, we've experienced the same difficulty putting the frame up and down. Nearly impossible to do it easily, which does make changing the linens a bit difficult (and take longer than it should!). If it was easier to lower and raise, I would rate it much higher."
1,Much too hard to put together,"I found this rail ridiculously hard to assemble, and do not recommend purchasing it. As the parent of two young children, I am accustomed to assembly (have assembled two cribs, countless Ikea items, countless toys and other kids furniture). Not only was this going to take me over an hour to do, in the process of trying to get the netting over the bars, it was so snug I had to get a second person to help, and we still ended up ripping the nylon in the process. Maybe the one we had was defective, but I ended up throwing it out and purchasing a Safety first secure top bed rail. I was able to assemble that easily in about 10 minutes, and it works great! It is a much better choice in my opinion."
1,Biggest POS!!! Flimsy and one side will not lock at all,Don't buy this. It is flimsy and very frustrating to use. One side will not lock. Not a safe product at all!
2,It's fine. But I wouldn't buy them again.,"Assembly was fine and they fit well on the bed. As others have stated the drop-down, hide-away function isn't that great. The washers are made with soft aluminum (or whatever metal they are); they are easily bent and twisted out of shape. Once this happens, you are done for. They will never work well again. On top of that the pins meant to lock the rails up have a spring mechanism that tends to come through the holes and need to be fiddled with.In the end, mine don't work properly and are no longer 100% reliable. I keep them in the up position and have them permanently secured with wire...just in case. Unfortunately, there aren't many other choices out there."
4,Child safety,Works great. Had to tie the straps to the poles cause the plastic clips broke. Works great. Still using it now
3,wrong parts,"dont know how the bed rail would""ve worked because i couldnt put it together. instead of a left and right side-there were two lefts. chose to return it and order a completely different type of safety device"
3,Good but a little flimsy,"I grew up with a sturdy one piece metal bed rail, so this is much better than that for looks and it doesn't get cold like my old metal one did! However it's very hard to get the straps in the perfect position so that it's tucked snug against the mattress, and assembly isn't as easy as you would think. Overall it's a good product and I like that you can hide it under the mattress, but if i had to get another one I would get a different model."
1,Poor design and poorly made,"To get the bed rail to collapse and go under the bed, you need to press in two little spring-loaded buttons. Every single time I try to collapse it, one of the buttons gets stuck and I have to take the whole freaking thing out from under the mattress to get enough leverage to unstick the button. Also, the buttons don't *stay* out during the stow-away process, and so I need to go through all the trouble of unsticking them again when I put the bed rail up!! It's a giant pain in the butt and involves lots of cursing and back pain (from lifting the mattress up repeatedly). I'm going to return this thing.Also: owners of platform beds beware: Make sure there is enough room on either side of your mattress for the bed rail hardware, which takes up a good 3"" of space.I'm astonished that this product has so many positive reviews."
3,Picture is misleading,"The first picture shown for the product is a 56"" model. The one being sold is the 45"" version. This should be corrected."
1,just awful,do not like this productit is very hard to get rail under bedpops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in track
3,Others are better,"Made in China....buy USA. That said, I could not find one made in the USA.During the purchase, I do not recall seeing anywhere that these needed assembly. As I am pretty mechanically inclined I found the assembly instructions a little lacking. After one false assembly, I could better understand what the pictorial view was trying to explain.This rail is built to fold down and then tuck under the mattress providing a self-storing feature. If the latching pins decide to become difficult, which they often do, using this rail in a dimly lit room is frustrating.I would not buy it again. I would buy one that is ""L"" shaped all the time and is not self storing. I borrowed one until like that until this one arrived and I found the borrowed one was much easier to deal with."
3,Needs Boxspring,This bedrail needs a boxspring in order to work properly. We have a set of bunk beds and had no boxspring as bunk beds don't require them. There was no where to hook the anti gap hooks to so we had to improvise. FAIR WARNING!!
3,Not ideal for a bed with slats,"This safety rail would probably be ideal for a bed with a box spring, but for a bed with slats, some creative positioning is required to make it work. It does what it is supposed to do which is keep my children from falling out of the bed, but for the type of bed they have, we will probably have to adjust the rail every night to make sure it stays in place on the slats. Not a bad purchase, however, buyers should be aware of this before ordering."
1,Unsatisfied,I recently bought this bed rail. We noticed the cover was unraveling a little when we bought it. We washed it once and it completely unraveled. We have had to use duct tape to keep it together. I called and explained this to a customer service representative while asking for a new cover (what most companies would offer because they want to offer quality). The representative was rude--telling me it shouldn't be washed. He was sarcastic when I was inquiring about the straps on the product (as he had me searching for the model number). Once I found the model number he said he can put me on a list to receive a new one but never asked for my information.
3,"It's okay, but....","I'm using this product on a senior that keeps falling out of bed. It works fine. However, it is somewhat flimsy when pulling it out and locking it in place. The locking tabs are very frustrating to use. They pop out when I pull the rail out and/or bringing it up to lock in place. Sometimes the locking tabs would get stuck inside the rail. Also, the person, I'm using this on has a foam mattress and makes it difficult to push in between the mattress and box spring. A positive point is that once locked it is firm and keeps my person safe."
4,OK for the money,Rail is alright. Was not able to use the hooks that hook to the other side of the mattress. This thing is designed for a mattress on a box spring. Our little guys mattress sits on slats. It still works just cant use the hooks. The weight of the mattress holds it down ok. Our slats are screwed down so if yours are not you will need to secure them so they dont move. If they move the rail will not be stable. Will not be able to use the fold away feature but who cares.
1,Don't buy this,"This thing is garbage. It's flimsy, it takes two hands to release they very small buttons. The buttons do not release or lock well. The assembly instructions are lame. I am throwing this in the trash, it's not even good enough to donate to Goodwill."
4,Gets the job done,"The directions for putting the rail together aren't really clear so if you have problems with stuff like that, you may want to get a different one. It's not rocket science, just some things weren't labeled the same as the directions so I had to make a couple of assumptions on what went where. I don't use the hide away feature, but I assume it works. I have leaned on the rail, my son has climbed all over it and it has held up great and never fallen."
3,hard to use but it works fine,"it is very difficult to put up or down, specially compared to the folding kind, but since my baby's bed was to short to use the folding one, we got this one (the folding one is in our bed). the metal hinges are sharp and dangerous, we cover them every day. unfortunately i didn't find another product that folds away, so for now it works fine. my baby loves her new bed!"
2,Disappointed,"I previously owned the same bedrail and needed to replace it. I did have problems with the first bedrail from Regalo. I had to bend metal parts to get them to align and assembly was not easy. However, the first bedrail did last a long time and I decided to purchase another. I was extremely disappointed with this newer bedrail. Again I had trouble with alignment of parts and this one was made more cheaply. They eliminated buttons and metal parts with plastic. Of course after struggling with assembly you don't feel like repackaging and returning an item. I don't like to leave a bad review, but the company definitely needs know improvements are needed."
3,"It's okay, but you have to really adapt it if you have a platform bed.","This works great, but if you have a bed that does not have a foundation on it (platform or bunkie board), you have to adapt it. The hideaway feature also becomes useless. It does work well, so I kept it."
4,Very good bed rail,"I bought two of these several months ago when my 3 yr old transitioned to a big girl bed. Set up was relatively easy and the hide away feature is great. If installed correctly, there is really no way a child can fall out. The only reason I did not give it five stars is the lock/unlock mechanism is a little tricky/annoying at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is easy. Still, that is something that could be improved upon. I will be buying two more when our son transitions to a big boy bed. Over all, this rail is very well made and I would recommend it."
2,regalo could make a better bedrail,I am not crazy about this bedrail at all. I bought it for co-sleeping with our 6 month old. It was difficult to put together as the directions were horribly written and the illustrations left a lot to the imagination. When I finally got it together and put it in the bed the latch for the rope that holds the rail to the bed broke. I still tried to use it that night and i could feel the rails under the mattress as they are really thick. I returned this one and bought one that doesn't hideaway and includes a blocker for the baby to not roll between the mattress and rail - this one leaves a sizeable gap for baby to roll into.
3,It works but nothing special,We bought a new bed for my 5 year old daughter and bought this for protection. My main gripe is with the assembly of the rail. While I did not have any problems my wife would have had difficulty putting it together. The directions were not that good and it had alot of poles. One positive thing is there were no tools required.We bought a bedrail from a different company and they also had a lot of poles and required a screwdriver so I can't say I found a better option.The bottom line is both bedrails work when put together but for someone not mechanically inclined you may have some trouble putting it together.
3,just ok,This doesn't work for me because my daughter has a bunk bed so the little rail that holds the mattress in blocks it from folding down and sliding under the mattress. I am not really able to use it as intended.
1,The Mennonite Publication,I have not received an issue of the Mennonite Magazine. I am worried it will not come and I will be out 44 dollars. That would be a drag....L.
5,brought back memories,"i was going through an old box at my parents house and i found the ORIGINAL tape(minus the case) that i picked up back around 88. so brought it home and played it. i forgot that the tape had been eaten many years ago, but you can still hear the licks. so i decided to search and here i am. my faves from this album are: bullshit society and sit there. if you like bands like old slayer(pre reign in blood), cryptic slaughter, posessed, exodus(bonded by blood)and the such you're sure to love this album."
4,Just alright....,"Virtua Tennis is a decent tennis game. The graphics are pretty good. The sound is good with many voices. The control is just average, you can't really hit the ball to where you want to.. The gameplay is decent, there's a mode that allows you to create your own player and you can buy things from the shop, play mini-games, and compete in tournment. The mini-games are interesting cool bonus feature. All the players except the Williams sisters are unknowns or amateurs, because I've never heard any of them! I was expecting Andrea Agassi, Roddick, Seles, and others... At least the Williams sisters are there, Serena Williams is absolutely my favorite tennis player. Overall this game is fairly good, for under ten bucks you can't go wrong."
3,A decent bargain game,"Virtua Tennis is a good GBA tennis game, if not up to the standards of tennis games on other more advanced platforms. You can direct the ball in a general direction, but in general the ball will just keep going to the same couple of spots. Serving is well-executed, and is one area where you can really excell with some practice. The World Tour game mode is the most interesting; you help build two players, a man and a woman, to the top of their respective circuits. Unfortunately, this requires both singles and doubles play, and the computer doubles players are really poor players, alternately hogging the court, and later running away from the ball. The game has some problems, but is moderately diverting, and a good bargain."
4,Just William,"The only problem is that the producers had the name of the author wrong; it's a by Richmal Crompton not Richard Crompton.The book is a return-to-childhood experience which I enjoyed. I believe there are other ""William"" books in the series. They are about an eleven year old innocent delinquent who has a nice time living his life outside the adult perimeter."
4,"A good, fun read","Always well written, More William continues in the well-tried tradition of the William books. While ostensibly a young adults book, this is in fact written for adults, who can see themselves either as they were or as they would have liked to be. Amusing, witty, and with enough differences in each short story to keep us entertained. Enjoy."
4,OXO Products Rock!,"Like other OXO products, this one is also a good buy! Every time I buy OXO products, I get what I expect from OXO! Some reviews say it's too slow, but I think it's okay. I like this shifter better than traditional squeeze-handle shifters which make my hand and wrist tired. OXO flour shifter is easy to use, clean, and store, and I like it. The only disappointment was that the one I received from Amazon had a large dent on it. Other than that, it's a must-have for baking."
2,"Just ""OK"" Sifter","I've been slowly gathering a collection of Oxo products that are easier on me. I have fibromyalgia and one of my most painful places is my hands. I wanted to LOVE this sifter, and, while I think its a bit on the small side, I really fell for the covers that could be put on the top and bottom to make the job of multiple siftings much easier. I knew right off that a squeeze type sifter wouldn't work for me, OUCH! What I didn't realize was that the repetateive shaking with the Oxo would be just as uncomfortable. A really good concept, making comfortable kitchen tools, but too bad this one really didn't accomplish what I had hoped it would.Good points? Top and bottom covers, quality construction. Bad points? Too small, still uncomfortable to use, not made in US."
4,"study and reliable sifter, but slow","I have had this sifter for several years now and it is the best of the 5-6 I have had. It is sturdy stainless and has convenient covers on top and bottom. Since I have arthritis, I find it easier to use than a trigger type or winder . Yes, it's slower, and it is small, but for me it has lasted longer than any others I have had, without leaking or breaking!"
2,Pick a different sifter,This one feels cheap and flimsy. I rarely use it and will probably buy a different style of sifter.
2,"Way too slow, poor job regardless","This sifter is way too slow--going through just a cup can take over a minute. The shaking mechanism, which I thought would be less tiring than a crank, is just as much if not moreso. Additionally, it doesn't do that great a job of sifting even after all that effort. Buy a crank sifter instead."
3,Oxo flour sifter,The size is good but it is a little tiring to squeeze handle when I have more than a cup to sift.
3,A bit of a pain to use,"Works well, and good quality. Just that the wiggle action is a it of a pain (and a mess) to use if sifting into a small bowl."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I bought this sifter and washed before I used it. The bottom strainer part came undone, so I pushed it back into place, except it wouldn't go back in the right spot, so everytime I shook it side to side, it wouldn't sift, because the metal piece that slides back and forth to sift wasn't touching the bottom strainer part anymore. Needless to say, it went back and I got the old fashioned kind with the squeeze handle."
1,Should have paid attention to other reviews!,"This is the worst product I have purchased from Amazon. This sifter is ineffective, difficult to use, and messy. I tried it twice....that was enough. Don't waste your money. It is far more effective to simply use a wire collander. Back to the old sifter for me."
2,Disappointing,"I recently took up a cake decorating hobby and found myself sifting a lot of powdered sugar, flour and cake mixes. I had a sifter with a squeeze handle which hurt my wrist after a while and purchased this one thiking it would make sifting much easier.As others have said, the sifting is VERY slow with this sifter. Also, I found that cake mix and powdered suger would get lodged under the blade and would not sift. It actually bent the blade upward, and pushed the mesh screen out.I wouldn't recommend this sifter. I am going to get an old-fashioned crank one this weekend!"
2,pretty but not fun,This sifter looks great but has a strange requirement. You have to shake the sifter back and forth for it to sift the flour instead of the normal (at least as far as I'm used to) trigger action found on most sifters. This works but is a little bit laborious and messy. It comes with plastic lids for both ends of the sifter which seem superfluous. It could do without the lids and with a lower price.
5,Just like mom's...,"I have been looking for a sifter just like this for YEARS. My mother had one with a similar mechanism and a handle on top that you moved from side-to-side; I much preferred it over the one with the squeeze handle. So, after I ventured out of the house on my own, I hunted for one, but to no avail; I've had to make due with the awful squeeze handle type that take forever and cramp one's hand. This one is a new twist on that old favourite that makes it even easier...no handle on top to move back-and-forth, now it's just a simple shakeshakeshake and you're through! The plastic covers are a great addition, especially when filling the sifter. Oxo products come through again!"
4,Excellent quality,"Like most OXO products I've tried, this sifter is solidly constructed and has a comfortable handle. Other sifters I've used are operated by squeezing a trigger-type mechanism behind the handle, but this one has a hinged handle that swivels back and forth when you shake it. I find the shaking motion is easier on my arm if I'm sifting a large quantity of flour. The sifter also comes with plastic lids for the top and bottom which are nice for storage."
2,Don't like it,I think you are supposed to hold the container and wobble the handle to sift. This was very awkward for me and I only used this item once. The build quality is also cheaper than many other Oxo items I own and the design is terrible. I would avoid this item and pick a different sifter.
2,"lid doesn't fit, sifter is awkward to use","We were really disappointed in this product. In the past, this brand has put forth some great products, but this one really falls short. We have ended up having to use heavy household tape to keep the top lid on, which still doesn't keep it airtight and the contents fresh. The sifting is ""awkward"" according to my husband. Again, I would not repurchase but I will still keep trying other items by this brand, because in the past I have been impressed with the brand. oxo"
2,"More like a ""duster"" than a sifter","Its a new game: See how long you can tolerate trying to sift with this thing before you put it down, get a mesh strainer to sift with. I lasted 20 seconds. I gave this 2 stars only because I could see using it to ""dust"" things"
3,Better for workouts than baking,"I generally like Oxo products, this one didn't live up to their standards for me.Pros:- Love the lids. Pour in the flour, then move it to the bowl without spilling!- Comfortable to hold- holds a decent amount- sifting movement doesn't kick up dustCon:- Sifting requires moving your arm back and forth rapidly. This tires your shoulder quickly -- the strain is focused on your rotator cuff.- Not easily used ambidextrously. I can complete many tasks lefty. I don't seem to be able to control this action sufficiently lefty to give my right arm a break. (But... rotary sifters are much worse in this regard)The lid almost makes me recommend it, but, my shoulder overrides the gadget lover in me. It's not quite bad enough buy a replacement and toss, but not good enough to get the same one again. Then again, its not clear that the trigger squeeze models are going to be all that less tiresome."
2,slow and tedious...,"I like OXO products for the most part, but this sifter, is more work than it should be, takes forever to sift even a 1 cup of flour, and leaves your hand/fingers numb. I was not pleased with this product. Helen in Maine"
1,Fails over time,"I have had this sifter for a few years now...used infrequently. Now, it needs to be replaced. It worked great, at first, but over time, the mesh gets distorted and the surfaces no longer touch and hence the flour does not get pushed through. I've resorted to using a knife or other utensil to help, but it is virtually impossible. Good in theory, not in practice."
3,Neat idea but a little off.,I received this as a gift and was fairly happy with it. I have tendonitis so not having to squeeze was a little easier on my wrist. It was also nice to have to lids to seal it with. You have to make sure to use a large bowl with the sifter or half of the contents ends up on the counter. Overall a pretty good idea but it has it's limitations.
1,"Had high hopes, but this thing is slow","OXO usually makes great things, this sifter does the job, but if you're making something large be prepared to be there awhile. It's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire. I would not recommend this sifter, just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies."
2,Buy It Could Be A Law Instead,"Gregory breaks very little new ground here. Most of this material is just a rehash of his stellar ""Could Be A Law, I Don't Know"" with all the curse words (even Hell and Damn) sloppily edited out. Instead of bleeps there is just silence. Also many of the words around the curse words are lost as well, ruining some of the material.The K-Mart Ham routine is still classic though. I really belongs on a better CD published by a better label."
5,nice stuff,"nice overview of roberts first 3 albums, with some interesting guitar playing , very new orleans , swamp style, good blues."
3,Not her best book,"I am a huge fan of Ms Wood's books, but was a bit disappointed by The Blessing Stone.My criticism is mostly about the two prehistoric stories.1) Why is she explaining constantly about the things the people in the first book did not have any knowledge of? It seems a little patronizing towards the reader.2) Is it really true that up to the time when the second books ends (10.000-8.000 BC?) people did not have any idea where babies came from?The rest of the stories was better, but still not up to her usual standards. Maybe Ms. Wood was limited by the short stories? I liked Sacred Ground, The Dreaming, The Prophetess, Perfect Harmony, Green City in the Sun and Virgins of Paradise much, much better and am looking forward to her next full length novel!"
2,Read It Fast To Get Through With It,"This was one of those books that I read through as fast as I could to get it over with. I had a hard time connecting with a few of the main characters in the book. The author seemed to try to strike a balance between giving us a rich environment and well developed characters, but it just did not work for me. I did like the strong female characters. As for the stone, the ""Interim"" paragraphs at the end of each chapter actually took away from the stories, because it absolutely caused a disconnect between where the stone was and where it ended up."
5,Best book for 70-305,"Want to pass 70-305 first time around ? Use this book and the braindumps (www.braindumps.com) and you're there !Mind you I did find some errors in the book, but after contacting Brian Reisman I received help within days !I send my additional errata to Brian, to check and update the Sybex online Errata and later the next edition of the book."
4,Trapped people,"This film is not for every one becouse it will shock,offend,and psychologically assult you. It might even show you the dark place you might be in but dont want to see and what could happen if you don't get out of it. If you are attracted to films that are psychologically dark, surreal,and uncompromising like the works of Luis Buneul, David Lynch, and Claude Chabral then this film is for you. This films commentary is a must listen to if what the film is about flew over your head. I viewed it on blu ray its a bit grainy but if you get engrossed in the story like i did you will not notice it."
2,I'll tell ya what this should have been called!,"It should have been called ""The Male Booty Movie""! Every ten minutes some guy is showing his butt. Either he's getting busy with a woman or mastering his domain. Don't get me wrong: long live men's butts! Still, this sure had a lot of them, especially for a non-rainbow-flag film. If you like the male buttocks, then here's some excellent eye candy for you. Happy New Year!!!"
4,How I Met Your Fool of A Mother (Warning: Do not miss the beginning of this movie - it is EVERYTHING.),"Do not miss the very beginning of this movie when the mother character walks past the cells with people suffering from Nahtzee medical experiments. Seeing is not the same as reading about it. Well, even Jews have dumb narcissists who endanger everyone and throw other people under the bus as if it weren't even happening. That's the kind of person depicted in this movie. Because her kids never figure her out, they are hampered in their assessments of the outside world as well and so she created and instilled a downfall for each of her children and they have no idea they have been fed a fatal dosage. I'm sure that off camera, the ending is that her ""boyfriend"" kills her. I see this movie as the less entertaining companion piece to Lady Gaga's concentration camp music video for Bad Romance."
1,Don't waste your time,"I ""was"" a Josh Lucas fan before I made the mistake of renting this. It was complete trash. Josh has some explaining to do."
3,Death in Love (DVD) ~ Jacqueline Bisset,I got this DVD because of Jacqueline Bisset. It wasn't a great movie but it was to see Jacqueline Bisset in a movie.
3,"Good, but too long.","This would be a four star album had they just cut out the space filler. While tracks like Assimilate and Dead Lines will keep you listening, most of the tracks like Tomorrow and Falling will be skipped with ever listen. If they just left the 9 or 10 actual songs on the album, it would have been a lot better."
2,Not as audacious as their later stuff.,"I am particularly derisive of this album because of its uninspired regurgitation of the more artsy (and accessible)sounds of its day; it feels like bad Cabaret Voltaire mixed with early Zoviet France. SP's later albums are subversive and deranged, albeit beautiful and addicting: the only reason I'd listen to this album is for its history . . ."
3,Highs and Lows,"This was one of the first albums I ever bought, and re-purchasing it (which says something) on CD gave me the chance to re-evaluate it. The bottom line is that some of the songs are great (I Surrender, Spotlight Kid, Vielleicht, Can't Happen Here and Beethoven's 9th - Difficult to Cure), some huge lows (Magic) and some very middling stuff (Midtown Tunnel Vision, Freedom Fighter). Probably the weakest of all the Blackmore/Lynn Turner collaborations. All in all, if you are new to Rainbow get another album (e.g., Rising)"
4,A fine album from Rainbow,Difficult to cure is one of the best albums from Rainbow and has some of the best songs .highly Recommended.
3,Mixed feelings,"I loved this as a young lad - I thought it was great pop Rock but now I have mixed feelings about this album - some really good poppy tunes like ""I surrender"" and ""Magic"" and ""Can't happen here"" but I am also conscious looking back that it was the beginning of the end leading as it did to the dreadful ""straight between the eyes"". Some fine guitar playing though but I do think Joe Lynn Turner was a mistake."
4,Solid effort,"I believe that it's Ritchies attempt at safe ""Van Halenesque"" rock and roll at a time when that's where the wave was going.However with respect to the everyone that says he abandoned his integrity for AOR it's just not true.These are still good songs that have substance. They aren't songs that are, like every other song from that era , centered around the guitar solo.I like Joe Lynn Turner. Get over the fact that he's not Ronnie Dio. He wasn't meant to be.This is a different Rainbow. They're both good.This incarnation has got a late 70's Bad Company / Foreigner type feel to it with a little bit more of a blues flair .It's decent and worth having"
3,Rainbow's weakest studio release,"Even still, there are enough strong tracks to merit 3 stars. ""Spotlight Kid"" and ""Can't Happen Here"" are great and would have fit nicely on ""Down To Earth"" (and been improved by Graham Bonnet's vocals). ""No Release"" is kind cool, if a bit generic, and the two instrumentals are just fine. By the way, the definitive version of the title track (Beethoven's Ninth) can be found on ""Finyl Vinyl"" where it is performed live with full orchestra--fantastic.As for the rest, ""I Surrender"" and ""Magic"" are attempts at pop, the former being marginally acceptable and the latter just awful. ""Freedom Fighter"" and ""Midtown Tunnel Vision"" are just dull and generic with bad lyrics.Joe Lynn Turner is easily the least impressive of Rainbow's vocalists, but he is still pretty good--just somewhat lacking in character. Not a great album by any means, but there's lots worse. And, hey, that is Ritchie Blackmore on guitar. How bad can it be?"
2,"Why did you do it, Ritchie?","I usually refer to this album as ""Difficult to CARE"" which pretty much sums up my opinion about it. ""Magic"" is a complete waste... the worst song ever performed by Rainbow. I can only listen to ""No Release,"" ""Can't Happen Here,"" Ritchie's excellent solo in the middle of ""Freedom Fighter"" and ""Difficult to Cure"" or Beethoven's 9th without having to flee."
1,"""Difficult"" to Listen To","I consider myself a Rainbow fan, but this album was just horrible. Rainbow really peaked with ""Long Live Rock and Roll"", but with this release, Blackmore abandoned all rock and roll and went for the pop jugular. It was like listening to Survivor. The lyrics were uninspired and the songs were paint-by-number. Especially annoying were the keyboard playing by Don Airey (God I miss Tony Carey). I was wondering why ""Spotlight Kid"" sounded so familiar, then I realized it was ""Kill the King"" warmed over. I literally threw this cd out of my car window during the second listening of ""Magic"". Ughh. The trouble with Rainbow is that Blackmore changed the line-up constantly so that the band never really aged together, like Zepplin or U2. The reviewers who loved this album were brought up on pop tunes, not rock and roll. Sorry, but this album ain't rock and roll."
4,"Not nylon, it is stainless steel","Amazon states that this item is ""sturdy, nylon construction; safe to use with nonstick cookware"". The tag on this OXO whisk reads ""stainless steel"". Perhaps you are willing to use this on your nonstick cookware ...... but I am not willing to risk scratching my cookware investment.If your cookware can handle stainless steel kitchen tools, this appears to be a very good whisk."
5,Very useful,"This is a very useful tool for mixing the dry ingredients in your baking. The rubber handle makes it comfortable to use. Very sturdy, sufficient product."
4,Fun multiplayer i guess,"when my little cuzn brought it over it was fun when we played multiplayer, but other wise if older u shouldnt buy this game. maybe rent it and play with some young(not to young) kids"
2,"Amazing graphics, poor gameplay.","This game is simply spectacular in the way of graphics. Never have I seen something so close to an interactive cartoon. It is a pleasure to watch the game. Unfortunately, playing it isn&#65533;t so great. It is a typical run-around-and-smack-people-over-the-head-with-various-objects-type game. It is too repetitive and predictable for the older audience, and a bit to complex for the younger kids. I would recommend not purchasing this game unless you have rented it and really like it. It might be worth having around the house if you can get it used at a good price, though."
5,Great family game!,"This game stays true to the characters and is great fun for kids (and parents!).You play on stages at a studio. There is a saloon, a labratory, beach, and more.Fun ways to nail your opponent, just like the cartoons! Your weapon hanges with the new stage you are on. Some are anvils, huge mallets, pan, axe, bone, electricity, bubble gun, bombs, pumpkin shooter, bee hive, a mini storm, flame thrower.There are not many games on XBOX that are kid friendly. This one hits the mark!"
3,Toy quality army car,"This is a nice addition to a toy military set. The quality are pretty typical of what you would expect in a toy. The above toy quality feature is that the wheel actually turns to raise and lower the gun. The bottom wheels are plastic pointed pin style, the cheapest wheels used in train cars.The plastic feels very inexpensive and the cars are very light in wieght. The couplers are horn-hook style. This is clearly a toy caliber setup for kids. The cars need a little more weight to pull better really even as toys."
3,Supplemental Robyn,"This basically consists of outtakes from ""Black Snake Diamond Role"" and demos. Even so, it's a fairly consistent and varied collection. Everything from good pop tunes like ""All I want to Do is Fall in Love"" to somber acoustic stuff like ""A Skull, a Suitcase..."" to silly stuff like ""Blues in A."" Basically minor Hitchcock, I suppose, but an oddly likable album and really pretty representative of most of what he does."
3,The Passionate Gourmet,I am serious about my coffee and grind my own beans. I have been on the look out for a way to accurately measure the beans I put in my grinder. This does it perfectly. A shorter handle would have given it five stars so it coild be stored in the container.
4,pewter bracelet,"i love my bracelet, I wear it everyday. I like the old world look about it. The only drawback is the fact that pewter is a soft metal,& bends easily. I have to be careful not to push it too tight on my wrist. Love my wolf bracelet."
2,I'm guessing its because its Pewter,"I don't really like the quality of it. When you start to bend it around your wrist you can hear it almost crackling. I'm guessing this is because its Pewter which I'm not familiar with but I'm sure I wont purchase anything Pewter again. It looks like it would be a nice weight and feel but it just feels thin and brittle, when you bend it you can sort of see it get bubbled cracks(thats the best way I can describe it). I thought from the previous reviews that I would like it.. But I don't. It's a 50/50 product I guess. All in all, I'm dissapointed and I know I won't be wearing it anytime soon."
2,The Broken Bracelet,"The look of the bracelet was exactly like the picture. It looked great on my wrist and for a month of wearing maybe 3 times a week. it broke. The metal broke right at the tail of the wolf. Maybe it is a weak spot at the wield, but I was shocked that it broke so easily. I liked the look and feel, but duribility is a big question. I would not buy this item again."
5,A Classic that's more Relevant and Fascinating Today than Ever,"I enjoyed reading this classic meditation on online life when it was published. But, like some other readers, thought its focus on a ""virtual rape"" gave that act more power than it deserved. Reading tinylife again today, I take that back. Dibbell's exploration of social issues surrounding interactive virtual worlds are still on the cutting edge of sociology. Only now they have emerged as frontrunning concerns of society as a whole. With the explosion of Web 2.0 and social websites gaining millions of members every day, once arcane concerns of virtual harrassment and violence are now a huge issue. Dibbell asks and answers the relevant questions far better than anyone else out there. Time to crack open a tiny life again for insights into our brave new world."
1,Not to be believed.,"Please don't believe a word Mr. Dibbell has to say. Those of us who are members of the LambdaMOO community can tell you how most of the events here have been changed to serve the author's point, and how untrue the entire documented experience is. This book is NOT a fair account of life on LambdaMOO, nor online at all! I regret that the general public will have an opinion of us based on what they have read from this book."
2,Boring.,"When I first heard about this book, I was very curious to read it. Although I never played MOO before, I did use LP MUDs quite often. So I was really eager to see what is there to write about a virtual community. The idea for this book, is great. But it is so boring. First, the book could be shortened to at least a 1/5 of its size. So many extra words!!! Second, it seems to me that the author was over romanticizing certain things. It seems to me he would be more excited from virtual rape than he would be excited by real rape. (Ofcourse, I'm excaggarating, but this is the general feeling I get from reading this book). Overall, it is an interesting book, but way too boring for my taste."
1,Book! Book! OK!,"Never in my life have I read such trash. If you enjoy unbalanced journalism that helps fuel the trendwagon, this certainly book is for you. But in my opinion, it stinks. IT STINKS! It gives the wrong impression about people who are online as being overweight, uncaring, insensitve, pierced freaks who have nothing to do all day but engage in tinysex."
1,Mr. Dibbell could use a life....,"""My Tiny Life"" about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term ""a wanker."" He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up."
1,Do not buy.,"Pretentious, meandering, and bereft of anything that could be mistaken for value. I question its use even as a cautionary tale of a man who has lost all ability to distinguish between the real world and a world of pretend."
3,"Okay, it's biased, but who cares?","I found this book compulsively readable. I was a regular on LambdaMOO at around the same time that Dibbell was, and I found his descriptions of the experience of MOO-ing (what it's like to be there and participate in various ways) quite accurate. As for his version of MOO history, I wouldn't take it too seriously, but then, he makes it pretty clear that the motivations behind and significance of the events that he recounts are disputed. What impresses me about this book is the way it captures the feeling of being in the MOO, and the analysis of the issues that got raised in various conflicts."
5,Good read,"As usual, I enjoyed this author's book. For some reason they don't get exciting until you've read at least half the. However, it turns out to be a good read."
4,another BJ Wonderful series,this wasnt the best BJ (Brenda Jackson) book but it was still good! And adds to the series of family love! She is my favorite author!!
2,Audio is terrible,This is VHS to DVD creation that has horrible audio quality. I wouldn't pay more than what I did for this thing (2 dollars).
2,Bad rating for bad quality,The quality of this video is bad. It really looks like somebody video taped the videos off a tv. There is a static line jumping up and down at the bottom of the picture. The case looks like a bootleg dvd. There are a couple of red videos though but if you're looking for something that you can play in an audio system you're better off buying them from itunes.G-unit!!!
4,The Best Videos are on here!,"I love this DVD. You get to see all of 50's best videos along with G-units'. When you skip, it skips right next to the next video. The video quality is 4 out of 5 stars."
5,TAKE HIS ADVICE: DON'T DIE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!,"Dan Nigito showed me how I could protect my life's work from tax devastation for my children, multiply it without tax for my grandchildren, while avoiding capital gains taxes and picking up a tax deduction for Betty and myself! The Family Foundation we created will keep our philanthropic legacy alive long after we're gone. And we did it all with money we would have lost to taxes anyway! Take his advice and Don't Die Until You Read This!"
4,S club rule!!,I just read a review and someone said s club were splitting up and that they talk to rachel on msn.Yeah RightThat review was written in febuary and it said that Rachel had left and she is still there.I think people should check their facts first other wise other people might beleive them.Sclub is still going strong and i think there t.v. shows are excellent.I can't wait for viva sclub(the new series)to come out.S Club Rules!!
1,Civilization is DOOMED if S Club 7 fan inherit the earth,"S Club 7 continues the venerable musical tradition first explored by such respected groups as the Archies, the Partidge Family, the Brady Kids, the DiFranco Family, Up With People, and Josie & The Pussycats. If you are annoyed by such things as musical creativity and provocative lyrics, this CD is for you. The perfect soundtrack for pre-pubescent Barbie fans everywhere! If this CD keeps the readership of Tiger Beat magazine off the streets, so much the better."
1,Kill me now!,"I have made the biggest mistake of my life and i want to die! I bought my daughter the 'S Club 7' almum. This is a warning, the album is tragic and will make you want to throw things. it is a bad 40 minutes of complete manufactured rubbish, though if that is your thing i reccomend it.Do the members have any real talent? I doubt it very much! With hearing the band members have been arrested for possesion it does give them a bit of credibility, also it brings a new meaning for 'reach for the stars', damn i want to die! DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!I would not be suprised if my daughters album goes 'missing' some time in the near future! GOD, how much is the psychological damage caused by this album going to cost to get fixed?"
4,A Good Start for S Club,"S Club 7's debut album in the United States, ""S Club,"" is, in my opinion, very well thought out. Good tunes, with inciteful lyrics make me give this album 4 Stars. Some tracks, such as ""Gonna Change The World"", ""Hope For The Future"", and ""I Really Miss You"" could all be big hits. Some songs, such as ""S Club Party"", ""Viva La Fiesta"", and ""It's A Feel Good Thing (Buenos Tiempo)"" are great dance songs, but lack the passion that some of the other songs have. OVERALL, it is a good album and a great start for a new-coming band such as S Club 7."
5,The best CD I own!,I love the CD. Every song is great. There is a nice mix of types of songs. Something for everyone. Personally I like the upbeat song Viva La Fiesta. They do some nice slow songs as well. The song Bring it all Back is a very positive song. I love S Club 7!!!
2,Another high-profile entry,"S club 7....sigh, they're another entry in the British music scene. Which isn't necessarily bad but isn't necessarily good either. While they do have 1 or 2 good songs such as ""Two in a Million"", is isn't enough to save the album. They suffer from the lack of unpredictablity and are on the verge of sounding juvenile (think Cleopatra). What perhaps is worse is the number of people in the group. 7 is way too many and considering that the guys hardly contribute towards the tracks (except for the occasional ""yeah"" and ""c'mon"") its a wonder they're still inside the group. Consistency is the key here and if they really want to attract a broader horizon of fans and listeners, they've got to do better than this."
3,S Club Booty,"Oh my gosh this album actually is alright ,I'm no fan but the only good song on this is S Club party ,I'm glad to see white people trying to be different and inforce a black theme in this song ,good stuff. Also that song Bring It All Back is quite impressive about never giving up .I'd rather get this then Spice Girls and thats for sure. Even though the album is repetitive its alright for people like me.MuchLuv goes out to All the people struggling Pizzy Thug."
1,Real instruments anyone?,What happened to people playing instruments and stuff? And 7 people?? What the hell do they all do?
1,What the...?,I listened to this CD because someone recommended it and let me borrow it. I absoloutly hated it. I'm sorry but it's just bad music. They do not need 7 people in a band because only one or two of them actually sing. The rest are reduced to singing choir and back up voices. I have no idea why my friend likes it so much because I absoloutly could not stand it. They are all cheesy toons that sound like something out of disney or something. The minute I put this CD in my player and listened to one song I HAD to turn it off!! If you like bubble gum pop poster bands then you might like it...that is if you're also a fan of one hit wonders...
3,Repetitive,"My sister bought this CD in St. Louis, and we listened to it as we drove home to Illinois. The first track had me (I still love it) and I expected the other tracks to be just as good. After track 2, ""Number One,"" the songs are repetitive and overlong. The band has pep and spirit, just not much creativity."
5,great!,"This cd is great.My fave song is ""your my number 1"" i think they od it on na na's.but aside from that its a great cd."
4,s club=pretty good,i first was hooked becouse of the t.v. show but now they can show the world that groups can be made of more than 5 people. and not every singer fronm england is fake!
5,S Club 7 is here to stay!,"S Club 7 rocks! Each member brings their own bit into the band.My cousin, Hayley and I love to pretend that we are part of S Club 7 when we get together.I can't wait for their new ablum.On their old one my fav songs are Bring All Back witht the sense that you have a choose, S Club Party with the feeling in it that makes you want to dance, and Two in a Million with that sense that when you are alone with that special someone that you two are the only ones in the world.This band rocks my world!"
3,Listen in the right frame of mind,"A word of advice for anyone thinking about buying this CD - don't go into it expecting ""S Club 7"" to be deep. Yes, it's fluffy, sometimes shallow, British pop. But what's wrong with that? The songs are upbeat and, admit it, catchy. I went in expecting the worst, and surprisingly, found myself tapping my feet and even singing along to songs like ""You're My Number One"", ""S Club Party"", and ""Friday Night"", even though I did think that 7 British teens without an ounce of Latin blood trying to sing salsa in ""Viva La Fiesta"" was ridiculous. Overall, I liked it - it's fun music and it made me want to dance.Is this the greatest album ever recorded? No. But the nice thing about ""S Club 7"" is that it doesn't have to be to be enjoyable. This album isn't very deep (come on, it isn't), and it might not make you think, but it will make you dance, and really, that's all that matters."
4,Object,"Clearly, there's no point reviewing this as music. 'S Club Party' is a future classic, and 'Bring it all back' is the most heartfelt song about auto-erotic asphyxiation ever to reach number one in the charts, but the rest of the music is disposable.As an object, a talking-point, however, it's much better. Sitting on a shelf, or casually thrown in a bag of Warp records, it's communicates to people that you are ironic, arch, witty and, simply, way cool. Aqua are slightly classier, and it's possible to genuinely like them, and Steps are just too proletarian (carrying a Steps album would be akin to wandering about with a Jim Davidson t-shirt - it's possible to be *too* ironic), but S Club 7 have just the right amount of artificial, 'Sunny Delight'-style hamminess to compliment an ironic wardrobe. They're moronic, but they're showbizzy in a way that more rural groups aren't."
2,If you thought signal transduction was hard...,"One gets the sense upon reading this book that it was translated into English from some esoteric dead language and not from that close cousin of English, contemporary German. One would think that a book this expensive and a publisher this well-known would be able to fork out enough cash to hire a competent translator. If you thought signal transduction was Talmudic in its complexity, you will not be disappointed as you try to unravel the meaning of sentences in this truly awful and labored translation."
5,Excellent for study!,"This was one of several books used for a college course took on Buddhism. Ta Hui was a major Chinese Buddhist figure, and his writings are profound. This would be good for groups discussion or independent study."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Dennis S. Reina and Michelle L. Reina discuss the importance of having a strong sense of trust in the workplace. They advocate avoiding both the major and minor betrayals that undermine trust. Creating an environment that promotes trust contributes to effectiveness in the workplace, especially during times of rapid change. The book discusses the nature and effect of trust. It is enhanced with a variety of exercises that promote workplace dialogues and help people think through the issue of trust. Many of these exercises are especially suited for teams, work groups and divisions. The exercises facilitate discussing and resolving problems in a more trusting atmosphere. This well-written, easy-to-read book is directed to front-line supervisors and unit mangers, although it will also interest top management and company owners. We [...] recommend this book to team builders in organizations of all sizes."
5,Introduction to phenomenology,"This book will be just great for introducing my master degree students on very important concepts on Phenomenology, especially intentionality. It will also cope with the hard task of explaining what phenomenology really is. I have used the D'Artigues book for many years, since it is a good one , however Sokolowsky gives e new breath to any one looking for a better understanding of that important philosophic approach to our complex and challenging human world, mainly nowadays due to so many conflicting relationships everywhere."
3,The chapter on gambling and house take is worth the price.,"Sort through all the hubris and squash exploits and you will find some sound advice for the novice speculator. I found the chapter on ""house take"" and commissions extremely enlightening. My full service broker has rued the day I purchased this book."
2,No one-line summary.,"I was more impressed with Victor's Squash championship (which he endlessly describes) than his trading strategies. On the other hand, he made honest and reasonable efforts to describe complexity. His best assest seems to be having lost serious amounts of his own and other people's money. Its quite distrurbing to read his descriptions of massive sessions (40+ hours) in front of trading terminals.I am oldbut I sure don't trade the yen :-)"
2,A Poor Read,"This is a brute joke of so-called trading guru from Brighton Beach. Vic gets the last laugh on us all. After all, you swallow the bait - you bought his book! ""Many games are won by players that are smart; many games are lost by players that are too smart"". And so on.Without a doubt Vic was a great speculator. This book brought me some good thoughts as to how gaming, gambling and competitive sports correlate with speculating the markets. Seductive title on cover is an excellent marketing that is not substitute for biographic prose, shameless self-advertisement, and simple investment cliches.Sometimes it is amusing. The last chapter unexpectedly named ""Sex"" - this is something quite new for the investment non-fiction. There are some interesting ideas in this book. But do not get this book if you are expecting the ABC of trading. If you're looking for a formula for trading success, this is not the book to read..."
3,Interesting but few tangible tips (other than don't short),"An interesting book about an interesting guy for those readers who like biographies and philosophical meanderings. Unfortunately, few practical investing insights are shared other than the one above (which I agree with!) To his ethical credit, Neiderhoffer puts the reader on notice in the first few pages that no great investing secrets will be disclosed as this would cost him (and the reader) the advantage. However, judging from the way Neiderhoffer lost his clients' money (heavily margined bet long on the S&P500 futures just before the Asian meltdown) with no offsetting put hedge (oi vay!), I am pleased he did not share his ""secrets""."
1,Really bad,Just a bunch of BS about how good he is at playing squash. It's completely boring. I can't believe I paid for the hardback of this book. Don't bother. There's nothing here.
3,Interesting but few tangible tips (other than don't short)..,"An intriguing book about an interesting guy for those readers who like business biographies and philosophical meanderings. Unfortunately, few practical investing insights are shared other than the one above (which I agree with!) To his ethical credit, Niederhoffer puts the reader on notice in the first few pages that no great investing secrets will be disclosed as this would cost him (and the reader) the advantage. However, judging from the way Niederhoffer lost his clients' money (heavily margined bet long on the S&P500 futures just before the Asian meltdown with no offsetting put hedge) [oy vey!], I am pleased he did not share his ""secrets""."
3,"Decent read..but if you're looking for stuff on trading psychology, Brett Steenbarger is far better","Decent read, though it reduces to a drag from time to time. Its easy to skip over those sections without losing flow.There are far better books on trading psychology by Brett Steenbarger."
3,Icebergs drifting on the market seas,"Mr Niederhoffer was without a doubt a great speculator. A winner and a strong competitor in his ventures. This book brought me some good thoughts as to how gaming, gambling and competitive sports corrolate with speculating the markets. Some very appropriate quotes are found throughout the pages and one that was specially appropriate says ""Many games are won by players that are smart; many games are lost by players that are to smart"". Maybe Mr Niederhoffer has been sailing to fast among the treacheous icebergs of the market seas and forgot to look at the picture of the sinking Titanic hanging on his wall. All in all it's a book that not only traders should read but everyone could benefit from its content."
2,Self-congratulatory---self-delusional?---biography,"You only have to read the Wall Street Journal of 9/10/97 to learn that the author--actually his hedge fund investors--were almost totally wiped out in the recent Southeast Asian currency and market collapse.Victor claims in the WSJ that George Soros told him to remain in the Thai market after it started its meltdown. Hmmm, what about Victor's individual responsibility for such a decision? It is always quite telling to have the opportunity to judge the future performance of a supposed investment genius, especially when the publication of a self-congratulatory biography coincides in time with a total reversal of his/her investment fortunes. Wonder what Victor will call his sequel--""Flunking out of a Speculator"", perhaps? As a final note, since Victor repeatedly links himself to George Soros in his book, please note that Soros got out of Southeast Asia unscathed, and has now reentered it to ""pick the bones"" of failed investors such as Niederhoffer"
1,Don't buy if you're looking for a daytrading book,"This is just an autobiography filled with tons of boring information about Neidderhoffer. I really expected more. Some insight on how to come up with good ideas, something, anything. No delivery."
1,Painfully Useless,"Another reviewer called this book a brain-dump and I can't possibly top that for visual effect or appropriateness when describing this useless book. I learned nothing that I didn't already know about trading and was subjected to painful stories about his boring family. The tone of the book is insufferably haughty, snobbish and condescending. He talks about how great he is in one sentence, followed by a declaration of his humility in the next. If you want to know where Niederhoffer's parents played handball during the winter, this book is for you. If you are looking for a real book about trading, buy Market Wizards."
4,Great book,If you've been trading and understand the market then you will appreciate this great book.
1,Totally Garbage,"The author was more interested to justify his ego than providing any thing valuable. And his trading methods, just like his writing, lack basic consistency. And it seems to me that the arthour as a trader was more interested in 'beating the market' than making money. This is one the worst books about investing I ever read."
1,It's Bad...REALLY BAD,I wavered several times on buying this book. I try to avoid auto biographical material on business people because they blow more smoke than give any decent information. I should have followed my own rule. I doubt the average speculator will find Niederhoffers squash tournamentadventures anywhere near as interesting or enlightening as he apparently does.
5,Every investor in stocks/commodities MUST read this book!,"This gem of a book is very honest and strips away the cherished beliefs of ""systems"" traders and outright gamblers. It candidly and powerfully proves that winning trades are based on intelligence and resilient, tough, competitive psychology. It is no accident that Victor is also a formidable athlete. The book is a rich tapestry, full of great one-liners about stock trends, such as ""you can't catch a falling knife."" Readers who can't find a ""get rich quick"" method here have precisely missed Victor's point! Fools will continue to be fools. The intelligent reader will be greatly enriched by Victor's unique perspective on the markets."
2,Hairy!,"This brush is the perfect size for brushing sugar cookies with colored frosting, HOWEVER, the hairs in the brush come out after the first couple of uses so that every time you frost a cookie, you are also picking out fibers. Next time, I'll just buy a silicon brush."
2,"Buyer beware: This pricey piece pretends, but is made in China.","I purchased this Weems & Plath Endurance Collection 085 Comfortmeter in April, as a gift for my mother. I think I spent $99 for just this item, about $300 for the set. For this astounding price, I was expecting an heirloom-quality, European-manufactured, quality item. My mother called today to say that the clock wasn't working. After inspecting the clock, and finding out that it was made in China, I looked at the other pieces and found out that they too are made-in-China movements."
2,Damaged book! Supposed to be perfect!,"I ordered this book BRAND NEW, and 4 of the pages were creased, and attatched to the inner spine area. The pages would not detatch so I had to cut them. This left the pages damaged. After unfolding the area, I saw that the pages were larger than the book itself,so I had to cut all 4 pages to fit. Now the book is in damaged condition. I can still read the text, but as someone who wants to have a book in mint condition, when they paid the price for it, I am very frustrated."
1,Hated it!,Just finished this book ... it's one of the 1001 Books to read before you Die. What a painful experience. There is not a character in the book you can like or feel any empathy for including Rabbit. I'm baffled that this book is considered such a success.
2,Aged poorly,"This is a well written book featuring an unsympathetic main character who is difficult to identify with. It portrays the suburban angst of the 1950s. This shtick has been done about 10,000 times since then, and I personally am sick to death of it."
1,Rabbit Run,The book came 5 weeks after I placed the order. It came outside of the time frame it said it would. I had to purchase another book because I needed it for a book club read. Never order from this company again.
3,No carrots,The problem with many other rabbit books is -- too many carrots. But this one -- just the opposite.
1,Where is it?,I can't speak to the quality of the item as I have not seen it.the delivery estimate was 3/23 - 4/7. Today is 4/16. WHERE IS IT?Not my first (unanswered) inquiry.
2,Tedious,Treatment of women revolted me and put me off. The struggle to finish it was tedious. I just didn't care about rabbit
2,"Loved the prose, hated the characters",Rabbit was not a person I could care about. Shallow. Selfish. So I didn't care what happened to him. Couldn't bring myself to finish this one.
4,Great Expose of American Life,"Although I am generally not a fan of Updike's work, this is a great beginning to his fascinating series about American life. The story traces the lack of fulfillment many citizens feel and does so in a way that is comically imperfect and not too preachy."
5,Interesting story,"This is a fascinating look at one character's life. I found myself reading it, then going away from the book, but always coming back. I like the fact the the main character is flawed and I could really relate to some of his angst. It's a long read, but I good one."
2,"Love the Writing, Hate the Story","Updike's prose is lyrical. His observational skills and ability to distill a moment, a complex idea or emotion are poetic. His story crafting is legend and well deserved. However, I hated this story. Reading it was like listening to a favorite song only to realize the lyrics are describing something repugnant. Maybe I'm burned out on the anti-hero or just tired of being sympathetic towards dirtbags who are too unclever to meet even a modicum of their responsibilities as they reinvent their lives or search for meaning. Whatever the cause, I'll run from spending yet another second with ""Rabbit."""
3,puzzling,"There is no doubt that the author's writing is poignant and insightful. The behaviors of protagonist clearly convey the dilemmas, challenges and impulses of youth. The story itself was not very interesting to me, however, the protagonist's internal thought process was. My only problem, however, is that the thoughts read more of the author, meaning a sophisticated, analytical intellectual, and not of the character. It felf as if watching a movie with a director's commentary."
3,The Beauty and Beastliness of Rabbit Angstrom,"I considered titling this post ""Sex and Updike,"" but that seemed more than redundant...Reading Updike has and will ever be a challenge for me--a constant struggle against the easy high road of feminist indignation--not because Updike's undoubtedly genius prosaic skills somehow redeem him for his misogyny, but because misogyny isn't and shouldn't be the primary focus of his novels, especially Rabbit, Run. Sex is and should be....(Read the rest on my blog! [...] )"
2,Rabbit Run Amok,"Harry Angstrom, a.k.a. Rabbit, is the main character who runs away from his wife and lives with a fat prostitute named Ruth. He has wild mood swings during which he runs back to his wife, then runs to a friend named Eccles, runs back to Ruth, and finally runs away after his daughter's funeral. Harry is someone totally irresponsible of his actions and acts hopelessly immature. If my summary of the book sounds pointless and confusing to you, then you have gotten the idea. Don't read this book if you're not a pious fan of John Updike."
2,Don't Do as I Do,"If Updike deliberately intended for this book to portray a person who's life you definitely should NOT imitate, then maybe this book should get 5 stars. But I wish that he had stated that a little more plainly. Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom is, as a character in the book says to him, totally self-centered and spoiled. It made me want to scold this fictional character's parents for doing such a poor job of raising him. The story is almost unrelentingly depressing. He thinks only of himself, and doesn't care who he hurts in his pursuit of his latest whim. It would be nice if he learned something positive by the end of the book, or at least acknowledged some of his shortcomings, but alas, that is not the case. The only redeeming quality in this book is a positive portrayal of a minister -- a man who is good, doing his best, yet human. That's a creature most writers today don't even know exists."
2,Terrible book,"This is a book about a loser that leaves his pregnant wife and moves in with a prostitute. They go out to dinner with various 'friends' and sit around and insult each other. There is not one likable character in this book. I gave it two stars because John Updike writes so imaginatively, but his characters need help."
1,Junk,"Uggh!!! Updike can't write worth spit! This is just pure junk. Not only is it dull, but it's about nobodies. A total waste!"
1,"Run Away from ""Rabbit, Run""","Having just finished this book I'm kind of sorry I did. Not completely sorry, as I liked the interactions between people and think Updike has a great eye for what makes people tick. But, about 100 pages into the book I was tired of reading all the net and snare metaphors ridden to exhaustion and decided to skip most of the overwrought description and focus on the interactions between people. The one thing that kept me going was a mild interest in seeing how Rabbit would devolve or evolve, but honestly, unlike most of the other characters, he's the same jackass at the end of the book that he is at the beginning. In the real world people who refuse to learn from experience are oddly fascinating, at first, but in books they stale quickly. Maybe the Rabbit series gets better, I hope so, but, I don't think I'll ever find out."
3,"OK...so I haven't finished this book, but...","So far it's been kind of a difficult read. The plot is kind of interesting, but the character, Harry Angstrom (Rabbit) is a really unappealing, amoral character, especially in his attitude towards women. He seems to hate women, be they his mother, his wife, or the woman he freeloads off of when he leaves his wife. He even has creepy, mysogynist things to say about a minister's 3 year old daughter. I don't know about this book. But I'm still going to try to finish it, because there is something about the writing that keeps me interested."
3,Kind of disappointing. . .,"Being sort of literary, I've heard about this Rabbit series for years now. Being sort of bored this summer I thought I could start the series. To say the least, I expected more; however, I also realize I must keep in mind that this is one of Mr. Updike's earlier works. This of course explains the immature slant. All and all I found Rabbit a very unlikable character. Running around on his wife and essentially killing his baby girl did not make me feel for his plight. If he feels so strained by domestic responsibilities then why put yourself in such a position from the start. If Mr. Updike's intention was to make one feel sorry for Rabbit, he failed completely. All through the novel I wanted to see him get some sort of comeuppance. I guess I'll have to read the next one to see if this happens. Meanwhile, I'll approach the next work with deflated expectations in an effort not to be let down"
5,Best Movie Mag Around,"If you are a movie fan looking for a read this is the magazine. Empire's strength is in treading a line between in-depth-analysis and shallow commercial puffs. In other words, it is not too serious yet again critical and independent.Ok, the p.o.v. is from UK so you might want to take that into account. Otherwise it is best magazine for movie aficionados I have read."
5,Another great LRB music collection,This LRB music collection won't let you down. Another great addition to my collection.
5,My first Lonesome River Band CD but not my last,"WOW, This CD is incredible. I listen to it practically every day. This was my first experience with the Lonesome River Band and now I am hooked. I'm a banjo guy and Sammy Shelor is incredible. Get this CD if you like good bluegrass."
5,Old Friend!,"I had this on vinyl and my kids trashed the turntable years ago so I got it on CD. It's so nice to have her back in my studio! For me, Prairie in the sky was her very best."
5,Very nice platter,Very pretty and a great size for holiday gatherings. Just as durable and nice as the rest of the pieces in this pattern.
5,Very good Quality,"We ordered this platter to go with the full set we purchased for our Daughters Wedding, Our Daughter specifically wanted a simplewhite pattern, and i have to say it is very nice, it goes well with most anything. the shipment arrived on time and as described, acceptfor the factory carton being a bit tattered, the platter was fine. i would have liked the box to be in better condition since it was a wedding gift, but it worked out fine, thanks"
4,A melodic prog metal band plays death-like metal.,"This is Savatage's EP that fulfilled their contractual obligation to Combat records after they signed to Atlantic in 1985. This is doubtlessly their heaviest record - songs like ""By the Grace of the Witch, Dungeons are Calling and Visions"" sound closer to Venom on speed than Queen on steroids. Drummer Steve Wacholz's Spybat Records re-released this in '94 with bonus tracks and a great photo of the late Criss Oliva. If you're into Savatage or other prog heavies (Queensryche, Fates Warning, Dream Theatre, etc), get this."
4,Awesome Savatage!!!,"After the great Sirens, this is the best of all Savatage. Raw and unpolished .... True metal heads have this release."
4,Great early album,This is Savatage's second album. It is raw and unpolished. A far cry from Trans Siberian Orchestra. If you like Hall of the Mountain King you will love this one as well.
5,Blows Metallica Away!,"""The Dungeons Are Calling"" is, quite simply, Savatage's best album ever. Every track blisters with heavy metal power courtesy of Criss Oliva, one of the greatest guitar players to ever burn the strings. Coupled with John Oliva's patented Savatage howl, this has got to be one of the best metal albums I've ever listened to. The live ""Sirens"" is unbelievably awesome and showcases the unquestionable power that Savatage exhibits during their live performances. For those of you who like Metallica, give this album a try... it's a hundred times better than the trash that metal-wannabe-band puts out! HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!"
4,Travel and history,I actually liked all the books. I am interested in the history of the Korean War brcause i had mant friends who fought there. I am also interested in trtavel almost anywhere.
3,"easy read, interesting but annoying at times.","This book was a very easy read. It kept me interested but I felt that at some parts I just wanted to skip ahead. She talk about visions and dreams and voices she hears and it gets annoying and seems very exaggerated. I eventually started skipping the parts where she randomly brings these things up, and I feel the boom would be so much better without them. Those visions and dreams and memories and sights of unreal nonexistent witches and people seem bland and not at all intriguing. But other than that I enjoyed reading about her time in Mexico and about her travels."
3,Mediocre Travel Writing,"I was not so impressed with this novel and felt that the author was too caught up in her own drama to take the reader on an interesting voyage with her. It was a decent read, but I can't say that I would highly recommend it. To read a great book about a woman traveling, check out Rita Goldman Gelman."
2,Well...,"I had just read Eat Pray Love and wanted to read more of the same. I was excited to find Nothing to Declare, but found it quite disappointing. She complains a lot about Mexico, how she hates to be alone, her new boyfriend (who takes care of her and makes her feel like the man in the relationship), and so on. If there was any self discovery in this story I missed it. Skippable. Read Eat Pray Love instead."
3,Ho hum...,"Although Morris would (and does) believe that she is a natural and effortless traveller, this text attests otherwise. Morris spends the majority of the work lamenting the inefficencies of Mexico and reminding us how bold she is for taking the journey. The other portion consists of her waxing lyrical about her indifference to love or how generous she is as the privileged and revered American. She continously struck me as bitter and egocentrical.Similarly, I think she adheres to the stereotypes she seemingly casts away. I particularly loved when she decided that she felt more like a 'man than a woman' in her relationship with the pampering/cleaning Mexican man. I also shuddered when she declared that her aforementioned Mexican love was like an 'Indian' when drunk.As others have suggest, the cast that populates the background are more interesting than Morris herself. Beautiful writing and landscape, but intensely annoying subject."
5,Reverb is King,"Reverb is king in this DVD. I went through a period where I thought I didn't need classical guitar in my life. For some unknown reason, I sold this DVD back to Amazon. I'm not sure why I did this - I loved Andre Segovia during his final years as a musician. This Dvd recounts his final days and beautifully shows how well the classical guitar sounds in his arms. The best part about this DVD is the effect of reverb on each guitar solo. Segovia plays in a hall (Alhambra I suppose?) and was able to produce the most spetacular sound in each recording. I own a Korg effects box, and I couldn't even reproduce the tone this man produced. If I were to record a good classical guitar CD, the sound from this dvd would be the sound I'd want to capture.There is an interview, as well. Mr. Segovia speaks English very well. He's a smart guy and I wish there were more guitarist like him on Earth. Unfortunately, he is gone, but this DVD lives on. I gave it five stars and I hope you enjoy it."
4,A Industrial Dancefloor Sound.....,The first full lengh album from skinny puppy. For a industrial album to come out 1984 you thank it would be a comepletly dated album yeal almost all of it is.... the only track which is not dated is 'Smothered Hope' i like all the songs on this CD and it's a shame that they don't play half the songs at a live concert. If your a SP fan you got to own this.
4,pretty good for something heavily 80's,"this was one of the first album i got by the Puppies. and despite the 80's drum beat and synth style i like a lot of the songs. particularly ""Glass Houses"" 'cause its fretless bass has a nice effect on the song. i also like the synth line in ""Solvent"" if you like 80's music (i can't remember but i belive its was called New Wave music) then you'll like this CD."
5,An album ahead of it's time,"I must agree with others, that this is the best album Skinny Puppy put out. While it did not enjoy the amount of production funding that their requisite efforts did, it manages to be consistently good. That can not be said of all that they put out over the years. Perhaps because it was when they they could stand each other(Ogre and Key that is). This is also when Bill Leeb was still in the band(B4 FLA). I still enjoy this album a lot. And, seeing as I bought it back in '92, I'd say I've gotten more than my moneys worth from it. It's interesting to note that Trent Reznor(the Hack), was a big SP fan. You can tell because so much of his style was ganked from Ogre, and SP in general. This is where it all began though, and the point when SP became a serious, if not highly influential, band. E.G. I highly recomend this album to even the most casual of fan."
5,1984...one of the most memorable albums of the decade..,"This year, this album turns 20 years old - and I still cannot believe how groundbreaking it was back then. If you can fathom what was being released during 1984 (Duran Duran, Prince, REM, Quite Riot, etc) this work of art exceeds anything that could be comprehended back then. A brilliant use of synths/samplers/sequencers, vocal poetry, and a vision - absolute brilliance. As for the comments of the tape release with Side-2 being backward, it was a print error by Nettwerk (the record label) & an accident. I have a copy; took the CD release to hear the second side normally!Get this CD - any fan of electronic experimental crossed with horror movies owes it to themselves."
4,Bizarre first listening got me hooked to Skinny Puppy,"The first time I heard this cassette, and yes it was a LONG time ago, there was a bizarre element about it. The WHOLE 2nd side of the tape was for some reason all played backwards. I thought that it was supposed to be like that, but of course I was wrong. I have since lost that copy, and I wish to GOD I still had it. The greatest thing about this cassette I had was I listened to it in my dorm room in college and I had a neighbor think that I was truly possessed because of the backwards songs. He would pray for me each day, and all I could do was laugh my a** off. Overall though, this is one of Skinny Puppy's better albums. Buy it if you don't already own it. You will be glad you did."
4,"The party side of Guarneri Underground, violins that rock!","I have seen this band in performance on several occasions and am thrilled to find a recording that does justice to them in a live setting. Their other CDs are sophisticated and musically exquisite, but do not convey their other face; that of a tremendously energetic and enjoyable band that you can dance to for hours. Particularly enjoyable is Jeffrey Sick's rendition of the Hendrix classic, 'VooDoo Chile'. This CD is an excellent representation of a band that is capable of bringing a whole audience to their feet. This CD gives the listener an opportunity to enjoy that hard to capture, live performance sound and personality of this talented group. The only reason I did not give it a full-on five star rating is because of some very minor technical glitches, but after all - it is a Bootleg CD!"
4,interesting information,"I purchased this book because we are traveling to Disney using I95. We are looking forward to following our travels using the interesting facts along the way. It looks very helpful by having the resturants and gas stations all marked for you. Thanks, Cathy Philadelphia"
5,Drive I-95 exit by exit,"Book is excellent for driving I-95. Gives you excellent maps. Also shows you hotels for every exit on 95, where the police sit, and what radio stations come in for every state. we used it on the way to Disney World. I just wished it had Florida in it. Florida is not in the book.Bryan from CT"
3,Most of 95,"This book seems fairly informative and interestingly presented but it has a major flaw. The book claims to follow I 95 from north to south but it does not. Through New Jersey it changes to I 295 and skips Pennsylvania completely, crossing directly into Delaware. There is no mention of Philadelphia or several significant attractions such as Independence Hall or the Liberty Bell. I don't know why the authors chose to by-pass an entire state and I can't understand why the editors let them get away with it. It makes me think perhaps they should have named it ""Drive Mostly I-95"". And if they missed this major part of their intended goal to ""Drive I-95"" what else did they miss?"
5,Drive I-95,"This is a very complete book if you are driving I- 95, it's a must have item. I wish there were similar books detailing I- 75, 80 & 90. Weel worth the money"
2,Yawn,"I was so excited to order this book. I guess I expected more of a guide book than it is. You do get listings of what is at each exit to the Florida border on 95- but I was hoping for some reviews(especially on the many many hotels along 95) The most info given on a hotel is if it serves scrambled eggs for breakfast-not if it was clean-or what services it has. Mobil travel guide would have been a better choice for me. Also it reads a little off. The maps in the front representing your trip down to Florida run from the bottom of the page- up(vs going from top down as you are driving) I found this slightly annoying. On the plus side, they do list a few off the road attractions and give a little history along the way. I guess for $20 I expected more."
1,Have you ever heard of Florida?,"I received my book today and went directly to the section on Florida. Oh too bad, they don't have Florida in the book. The longest state of all and it's not there. In the middle of nowhere when you could really use the information the most .it's not there. I know they will bring out Drive I-95, Florida version, in the near future and over charge for that one too."
1,Ripoff,It will take you forever to learn a song from this DVD. You cannot see what notes the guy is playing. His fingers block the view of the frets. No TAB or chords provided. The company should at least provide TAB on their web site.
2,Nothing instructional about it,"I got this DVD for Christmas and was exciting to learn some Beatles songs. My excitement quickly turned to frustration. The DVD is only a collection of up close videos of Mike playing his guitar. There is no tab, no music, no descriptions of any kind to tell you how to play any of these songs. I spent an hour trying to tab out the first few measures of Back in the USSR. At tempo or even in slow motion, this was impossible. Ask yourself if you can simply watch someone play and then play yourself without any instruction on what chords or notes to play. When I complained to GuitarSolutions.com, they suggested several books that I could purchase to supplement the DVD. I wish I had just received the books. I would be playing my favorite Beatles tunes by now."
3,"Good, useful > but has problems","Like others, bought this for my son after reading positive reviews. However, like the other negative reviews, I'd agree that this program has a serious flaw that you should be aware of : without any on-screen image to match what the guitarist's fingers are doing, it gets pretty confusing, as you cannot tell what the fingers are doing.However, the musicianship and musical insights are great : very authentic styles for all the guitar parts in all the songs."
2,A lesson in frustration is what it is,"There is no TAB included!! So, you have to try to figure out the notes and chords by watching them play. This is VERY difficult to do! And in some places, it is impossible to tell what they are playing. I am a beginner and so I am finding this DVD very frustrating because I am spending most of my time trying to figure out the notes and then writing them down. So, unless you are an expert at learning music simply by watching others play, I would not recommend this DVD."
1,cashing in on Clifford,"There are many wonderful Halloween picture books out there, but Clifford's First Halloween isn't one of them.The text is very boring and predictable, with lines like ""Mommy made us candy apples."" and ""My neighbors were nice."" Often the text doesn't correspond well with what's on the page. This is confusing for preschoolers. Older children won't mind when the very first page opens with ""I'm Emily Elizabeth, the cat"" but younger readers are confused. The same page shows a picture of a dog, and the little girl is wearing a cat costume. Honestly, the dog looks more like a cat than Emily Elizabeth does!The pictures are NOT really humorous. They seem hastily assembled, and truly there are dozens of picture books for young children about Halloween which are very worthwhile. Sadly enough, this book just seems to be trading on the popularity of the Clifford, The Big Red Dog character.Clifford's First Halloween is a picture book which doesn't have much to offer.ken32"
4,Wonderful Kids' Book,This book is perfect for kids. It's a cute story and is perfect for children who are learning how to read. If your little kids love to go trick or treating and love Halloween then they will love this book. It also shows kids that all the scary things during Halloween are fake and that you can just have a good time.I would recommend this book to kids ages 3-5.
4,Halloween fun with Clifford,"My daughter loves this book because she is a big fan of Halloween. In this book we read about Clifford's first halloween when he was still a puppy. He gets dressed up as a ghost, gets into a jack-o-latern, tries to eat a candied apple, and gets scared in a haunted house. Your child will love this simple, yet fun book."
4,"Excellent fresh ideas, needed better notes, sources.","This book is a wonderful collection of essays that give a fresh perspective on some well known historical events. Although you might think you know the history, Boorstin is like Paul Harvey, he tells you ""the rest of the story"". I would have liked to know his sources and other works about his topics so I could learn more."
4,"Walking Catfish, Grass Carp, Zebra Mussels, etc.","Invasive exotic species, get the picture? Eventually so does Thorn. A breeding program to develop a species of ""red"" tilapia under the theory that Americans will eat anything that's ""red,"" not so far fetched now that we know about red dye in farmed salmon, threatens to unleash a flood of unwelcome visitors into the glades watershed. The story is a bit heavy handed, but after all so is Thorn.I discovered a used copy of this novel in a bookstore in the Keys a few years ago while hunting a poolside ""read."" Almost got as red as the tilapia as I forgot the time in the sun and since have hunted down the entire series. A rough, tough south Florida adventure novel, and while not Hall's best it's worth the time if you like this sort of fiction. I do."
4,Consistent,Jim Hall is an excellent story teller. His charctor development is the most creative of all authors. No one does it better!
3,Eco-mysytery with compelling plot but over-detailed descript,"I enjoyed this book, an eco-mystery with an engaging plot about red tilapia--a contradiction in terms because impossible. Hall's descriptive detail was a bit over the top: one got the sense that he tried to build suspense by shifting to descriptive detail instead of continuing the narrative--thus one longed for less of it at times. His plotting and characters, esp. Sylvie and her father Harden Winchester were great.I especially enjoyed the description of snorkling but was thrown by the fact that the one character I really liked was murdered within the first few chapters. Her death was the kind that made you hide your eyes and hold your friend's hand."
2,"Unfortunately disappointing, no sympathetic characters.","While I've enjoyed later books by Hall, this book left me wondering if I cared if any of these characters lived or died. Thorn and Sugarman seemed unlikeable at worst, unsympathetic at best, and the other characters either bordered on annoying or superfluous. I finished it simply to see who would be left standing at the end.Read Hall, but not this book."
2,devotion to excellence,"The book is not what I expected, rather dull and did not really cover football, the co-writer did not offer much."
5,Purchased for a Friend,"I purchased this book from a friend he said this is a great book, and he enjoyed every single page, although im not a football/sports fan I may read this book for myself."
4,Good Theory - Don't know if it works.,"Well, I really like the book and the theory, but I've tried it for months and don't feel any different. I find that most things I like produce some sort of positive effect on me after trying them for awhile.Problem with this theory is you might have to live your whole life to see if it is valid.Anyway, I'm giving up the regimen."
4,Great JAzz Fusion,"This has always been one of my favorite jazz fusion recordings. Full of energy, innovation and instrumental bravura. There's an authentic hard edge here, but the popular roots are more in funk than rock."
5,It ALL becomes true!,"I wish I could detail what this recording does , and MEANS for me.This is REALLY!>the 1st EARLY 'RTF' album. with Al D. and.., my favorite . There is NO reason to say how incredible Stanley ,Chic, and Al D. ARE!!!, Because they ARE!.The best,uh,,,*NOVA* that happened for me in 1980 when I first heard this LP as a aspiring drummer, was Lenny White!.. HuZaah! ..A new machine!THUS! there is one final note;They are 4 individual Prodigys!, that if, ONE was missing....would be a SEVER loss to the whole!, or , maybe....NEVER anything without EACH individual'4'.THIS WAS,..IS!>the BEST 1st 'RTF', as IS ""Romantic Warrior IS the 2nd BEST! of our beloved ""RTF"". Just BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! God Bless!"
4,bill connors defined fusion guitar,"I was disappointed when Bill Conners left R.T.F.His sound gaveR.T.F an edge and defined fusion guitar.Listen to Chick Coreaand Bill lock horns on ""The Game Maker"", with Stanley Clarkthundering up the bass and Lenny White tearing his drum kitapart. The song is great.You can also hear Bill Connors onStanley Clarke's solo release, circa 1974, with the late greatTony Williams on drums and Jan Hammer on keyboards.Bill Conners wasTHE man."
4,"Very impressive, diverse sound","Boys of the Lough in Good Friends, Good Music captures the true essence and spirit of traditional Celtic music. From Scottish Highland music to Shetland style fiddling, they explore and illustrate the diversity and influence of the Celtic tradition on a variety of regions. All in all a very wholesome, pleasing sound. This was my first Boys of the Lough CD, and I was very pleased."
4,PRETTY FUN GAME FOR A WHILE.,"This game is a good solid mortal kombat game. A lot of characters and original ones like sub-zero and jax etc. Its pretty fun considering the 3 different fighting styles and moderatly different moves in each style. The only problem is after you play it for a long time it gets boring doing the same thing over and over and over again just with different characters. But it does somewhat pay off since you get to spend your koins to unlock so many different things, like a lot of extra characters. So overall this game is pretty good and recommend if you dont spend a lot on it."
4,A good version of a classic game,"Playing Mortal Kobat was practically a right of passage in the nineties, and this x-box version does a pretty good job of updating the game, yet keeping it familiar. The new moves (including weapons) have a fairly easy learning curve and add to the stategy. The valid criticism is that fatalities should be increased for x-box and the game generally doesn't utilize the x-box as well as it could. Still, MK for XBOX!"
3,What the Hell happened?,"Ususally MK games are the by far the best fighting games out there. But this time I asked myself What the hell happened? I have had this game for almost a year and the only reason why I haven't gotten rid of is because of the graphics and 3D fighting styles,and sometimes my friends crash over and is fun with them. That is great. But where they fell REALLY short is that it becomes a stale game almost right of way. With only one fatality per character it really bites. They should incorporate the same way the other MK games did, and that is like a fataly per scenerio or more fatalities per character. I don't know whether a MK6 will be out but if it does I will make sure those characteristics are in the game before I buy it."
5,Great Game,"This game is awesome, fully worth the price. It lives up to the legend of the original Mortal Combat. This has all the great gameplay of the original, coupled with graphics that rival DOA3. If you are able to buy this game do so, you won't regret it. The storyline is immersive and the finishing moves are a blast. My only regret is that it has no X box live support. Also check out Unreal Championship and DAO X-Treme Beach Volleyball."
3,Disapointed,"This game looked great. Three fighting styles, decent graphics, a few new characters, and a good combo system, but it's weaknesses made for an overall disapointing game.I like a game that's not afraid to show some blood, but this is just silly. Blood flies constantly, pouring down the hemophiliac characters in drops almost as big as their fists. They bleed for EVERYTHING. Some parts of the game have you trying to get X pints of blood out of your enemy before time runs out.Only one fatality per character and most are disappointing. No level based fatalities either. This is what made the Mortal Kombat series famous and they really dropped the ball here.I know better than to expect the plotline in a fighting game to be coherant, but this is just bad, not as bad as DOA3's ""story"" mode, but bad anyway. If your way into this sort of thing I'd reccomend renting it first."
3,TOTALLY KOMBAT!!,if you really love mortal combat you should buyitone of the mostgreatest games themore youfight the morecharcters you unlock. its easy to finish the game.it has some of the most coolist charcters. you wont wannaget off. i got4 charcters in one day. theres videos to watchand everything.
4,Killer Game,"I love this game. I haven't played all the other fighting games out there, but I probably played mortal kombat 3 until my original playstation died. Great fun, the guys like it because they can watch healthy, buxom women fight half naked (you pay a lot for those extra costumes, but they sure do show a lot of skin!) and of course the girls like it because they can kick butt in high heeled boots (and believe me, the chicks rock in this game!) I haven't noticed any of the lag mentioned in some of the other reviews, I really enjoyed a sense of accomplishment completing some of those crazy kombos! I LOVE the training section of the game.I would have liked to see Mileena come back in this one, but I have no complaints!"
4,Kome Here !!!,"Last night some friends kame over to play. We played, and played. Just enjoyed kicking each others butts. This game is fun. If you want fun, and you want it for a long time get this game. It has several modes in which you kan embark on that makes the game even more interesting. This game has lasting value. It makes you want to get better. I played it all last night, this morning and this afternoon and I have 4 other games to choose from. I'm taking a break writing this review, and now I wanna play again. This game is krazy. This game is better than Tekken 4. It reminds me of Killer Instinct."
1,"i grew up with mortal kombat, but dear God, this game was bad!","this game is so horrible. the graphics are bad, the fighters are boring, and i think this game doesn't have fatalities!"
4,Not Bad,Came quickly and in great condition. This game is fun but I recommend Armageddon. It has more characters and smoother fighting. Not bad though. Only necessary if your collecting them all.
5,Love the game,"Well, my mom got this for me, I needed 360 and she didnt know there was a difference. I paid so little for it and didn't want to hassle w/ the return, I took it to a local game store and upgraded for just a few dollars more. Completely satisfied. Mortal Kombat has always been one of my all time favorites. I remember when it came out for the first time. Still playing after all these years"
2,A turn for the worst,"This game is pretty bad, I used to be an MK fan until they released this garbage. Technically it's decent but it has no personality and the combo/fighting system is awkward. I actually rather play MK4 instead of this because at least that game had the spirit of the earlier games.3D fighters have left this series in the dust, I much rather play Dead or Alive... any of them."
3,much better than deception,"this mk game is easily the better of the 2 new mk games with the other being deception.the characters are far easier to obtain in this game.the levels can be frustrating but require simply skill and not so much luck.a whole plethora of awesome characters can be brought out.the new fighting styles grant you 12 really cool moves that are but a click or two away.you can use these and beat the entire game.only the ocd will actualy bother to learn the 200 button moves and the 219 click fatalities.they are cool but so not worth the effort.this game KICKS.........errrrr ummm well it kicks butt,man.go buy it!"
3,Lorna Doone,"I have loved this story since I was a child and I have read several more detailed versions of the same story. This version is from the Oxford Bookworms Library. This is a classic but whilst I got 100% value from this book, I missed the absolute detail that was built into the original of Blackmore's Lorna Doone."
1,DO NOT BUY - WILL BREAK,"I would STRONGLY recommend AGAINST buying this computer. While it is sleak and modern looking with lots of bells and whistles, it won't be long before it breaks. My motherboard randomly failed after only 13 months of use and cost over $800 to replace. When I got my computer back from Sony after having them replace the motherboard my cd/dvd drive no longer worked and they tried to tell me I had to pay to have that fixed as well! 3 months after having all of this fixed, now the computer won't even start. I am an IT professional and kept my computer in optimal conditions and care at all times so it was definitely not from my use that caused this computer to break."
1,Doesnt run Mac OSX. Don't bother!,"This computer while very attaractive is NOT a Mac. It runs the HUGELY flawed and buggy Vista. So given that I took it back. Buy a Mac, youll be doing yourself such a favor. Not viruses or spyware or bugginess.Just Mac goodness without all the flaws that makes Windows based PCs such garbage."
1,GIGO TOY SORT GIRL DOLL,DOLL WAS NOT AS REPRESENTED. WAS NOT IN A BOX. IT WAS PACKED IN A PLASTIC WRAP. I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SIZE DOLL FOR THE MONEY. NOT A GOOD BUY.
3,Expense for what it really is,"Besides the Melissa and Doug Brianna doll, I order this one for my three year old grandaughter. This doll is cute but rather small. Since I had to pay shipping, the doll total price of the doll was $18.46. This was way too much for this toy. If it wasn't too much trouble, I would return it to Amazon. The Brianna doll came in its' own box but this doll does not which will make wrapping a problem. Next year I will shop for baby dolls in the store where I know what I am buying and what I am getting for my money."
4,"useful, but a little flimsy",I bought this for a place to add an extra 3.5 hard drive. I didn't like the floppy face plate as it was very flimsy and didn't seem to hold together well. I removed the face plate and put on the case slot cover and it fit nicely and my hard drives works great up there.
3,Mostly for advanced jewelry-makers,"This book is not for the first time jewelry-maker. Some of the projects require power tools and have long materials lists. On the positive side, there are step-by-step instructions with pictures. Also, a wide variety of jewelry techniques and types of beads are shown. The ""Treasures for Free"" section is a good idea that I haven't seen in any other jewelry-making book. So, the benefit of this book will depend upon how experienced you are and how well-equiped your workshop is. Therefore, I think this book is best as a secondary source for most people."
5,Hardback book,"Appreciated this book being a hardback, expect it to holdup well with constant use. The color photography makes the projects more interesting and gives the reader good detail."
1,Go online before wasting money,"This CD is [bad]. It contains 5 exams, totaling about 1000 questions. At first glance, that looks pretty good. However, the testing interface is very cludgy and hard to use, and the tests are not randomized. In other words, every time you take an exam, you get the same questions in exactly the same order! What's the point in making a CD-based training if you're not at least going to randomly generate the exam from the 1000 or so questions you have on the CD?Instead, the author basically took 5 paper exams, stuck them on a CD, and charged [money] for it! Save your money. There are much better broker prep materials available online, in most cases for free. If you're really convinced that you want this author's ""CD"", email me and I will sell you mine for 1/2 price."
2,Pretty Lame,"I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash."
2,Predictable,"This movie had the worst most predictable plot in the world. It's your typical "" Run from the insane russian terrorists "" plot you've seen over and over again. The dialogue is also pretty stupid with one-liners like "" Sup B****es "" and "" Wicked Cool, man "". However, the stunt sequences were pretty awesome. And whats the deal with the dvd features? There's hardly any features on it!"
3,People get killed doing this,A semi-famous mathematician Obed Schramm died in a fallon a mountain climb. Even the best and safest arrangedof events like this can kill the stunt men and women involved.Holding the money man over the side of a building at the beginningtells you the producer knew there were real dangers involvedin making this kind of film. The kids are kind of danger addicted? It if the unexpected ones of bad guys in the plot that make the second half of the movie...
3,"OK, but too many holes","There are some good films featuring extreme sports. Unfortunetly this is not one of them. The actual footage of the sports was good, but the plot was a little on the weak side and there is no follow up as to what happend to all the charaters. All in all, a good DVD rental or worth a visit to see the film at a discount screen."
3,good eye candy,"ok, while not the best of fims in this gendra, it does have some great scenery, and if you happen to have a HDVT, or equivalent this DVD will be worth the rental just for the visuals. The action, when it happens is good enough to keep you entertained, and of course, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras is worth watching anyway. So all in all, not a bad film to keep you entertained."
2,Not Much Plot & Poor Editing - Avoid,"Avoid this one. The bad reviews are not kidding. The plot is almost non-existent. The action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing. The writing has drawn the characters very thinly. Sadly, a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together."
2,"""Extreme Ops""","""Extreme Ops"" was a horrible title. The plot was horrible. And director Christian Dugary's direction was terrible as well. There were no production values and the actors looked very confused. The only good thing about this mess of a movie is Bridgit Wilson-Sampres, and the incredible camra work mixed with some good action. Over all this movie was terrible. But Wilson-Sampras and the great cimematography are the only things you will want to see in this film. ** stars out of five."
4,Better than I expected (view of a boarder),"First and formost, this is an extreme sports (specifically snowboarding) movie. If you don't snowboard, you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did. To give credit where credit is due, the plot isn't about some boarders who get in the way of some terrorists and decide to kick some butt. It's about some snowboarders shooting a commerial who get in the way of some terrorists and are trying to get there heck out of there when they realize what's up.The stunts are no doubt over the top, just as you would expect, and the characters all contribute some good humor. Don't put on huge expectations, and you'll be rewarded with a good ride."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"The stunts, the action, and the eye candy was incredible. The storyline was strong and this movie could have been great, if they had focused as much attention on the story and the conflict as they did on the stunts. All in all, very entertaining, even thou there isn't much substance to it."
2,snowboarding mixed with bullets and action dont mix,"this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire. good snowboarding stunts, and the cast is great, Sawa looks a little scruffy looking. like I said, with the snowboarding and action, dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come along"
5,Compelling and illuminating,"I first heard of Elizabeth Taylor in an Atlantic Monthly review. I am a Barbara Pym fan(atic) and it seemed Taylor would be to my liking. I received In a Summer Season on Thursday and devoured it by Saturday morning. The story was compelling, the characters beautifully drawn and largely sympathetic. Some of Taylor's emotional or psychological insights caused me to catch my breath. I am widely read and slightly cynical, but I found this novel to be that paragon of literature--entertaining, informative, and thought provoking. I highly recommend this author and am only sorry it took me so long to hear of her."
3,OK movie,"I bought the DVD because I'm a huge fan of the Beatfreaks which is the female dance group that the lead actress is a member of. The movie was OK. I felt it needed more dancing. The story was kind of dragging. There was a lot of good scenes, but I guess since I'm a big fan of dancing, I just expected a whole lot of it. I'm still glad I bought it, to add to my collection."
3,So Many Plot holes,"So when I first saw the trailer for this, I thought it would be a good solid if not stereotypical movie of a dancers redemption but it was anything but. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, just not on in the way it was supposed to be. It starts off really fast with the dancer, Angel, getting stabbed by her ex-boyfriend. No explanation is given, she just automatically moves to California to live with her grandmother. After that it just gets weird. Her mother looks only like 5 years older than her, her grandmother is questionable, and everything just happens in such a whirlwind you are not really sure what you watch by the end. I say if you have a boring sunday afternoon this movie is for you or if you just want something to laugh at with your friends go ahead! Maybe if more people keep watching it, it'll make cult status."
2,Working Elevator?!! Where,"My five year old daughter loves this toy and has played with it none stop for two days.I am very disappointed with the FACT this does not have the ""working elevator"" stated in many product discriptions that I have found."
4,regarding the elevator,"This was the number one gift on my daughter's list to Santa. She saw it on tv and at toysrus. A friend told me that Sam's Club had the same castle only it came with the princess, the pauper, and the prince too. So we headed off to Sam's and were fortunate enough to get one as they were flying off the sales floor within minutes. Upon carefully inspecting it I discovered it was not identical to the one in toysrus. The castle from Sam's had the elevator...so, I was prepared to haul it back if my daughter was not completely satisfied. Sure enough Christmas morning she immediately pointed a difference. Twenty minutes later...it would not have mattered which one Santa left because she was ""enchanted""."
3,Am I The Only Parent Who Can't Find The Elevator??,"Okay....my daughter wanted a Barbie house that had a real working elevator and that is all she talked about thru the Christmas holidays. I found this beautiful castle on Ebay and snatched it right up....because it said it had a real working elevator. However, once my husband and I started to put it together, we found no elevator. It has been 4 days now and we have yet to locate it. I am just wondering why I seem to be the only one who mentions this.....am I just blind and can't find it....or is everyone else just not paying close enough attention?? The bottom line is this....my daughter loves it....and is happy without the elevator....but.....for the money, it looks like it would have the features it says.....and not make them so hard to locate if they are actually there! If anyone who reads this has found the elevator...could you please post a note to let me know where it is????"
2,"Cheap construction, hardly musical.","I purchased this castle for my daughter. It falls apart very easily, does not stay shut when folded, and the musical part is very lilmited. I believed it would sing a song, instead, it sings ONE LINE from three songs. Overall, the cheap construction is a problem because i keep having to put it together again for my daughter."
1,Totally regret buying this toy....,"It is very unstable. I am constantly trying to put it back together. The pieces fall off of it all the time. It was the worst purchase Ive made for my daughter.If I could take it back, I would."
3,boring,"i have not bought this toy but it looks boring.who wants to play with a dollhouse that on the ouside looks like a mansion but in the inside it is only two floors.it is cheap,princeses dont live in two bed houses. what if they have kids ever think of that mattel.booooooooooooooo."
5,Great Value and Ingenious design,"This was my daughter's large christmas item and I must say that I am very impressed. The structure holds together very well. My favorite feature is that it folds up and stores in a space only about 6 inches wide! But every inch has been used to enhance Barbie's home. The beds fold up for more space, and it all folds out to create the illusion of more room than there really is. There are many small touches and decor that add to its elegance and charm. My daughter has not stopped playing with it yet. I wasn't sure I wanted to spend that much on something built by Barbie (Mattel), because their Barbie stuff tends to be cheap and disappointing, but whoever engineered this castle deserves some kind of award! It was worth every penny."
2,Who Cares?,"As a big fan of the Father Dowling series, I was very disappointed in this first book of a new series. For me, the story was dull. I didn't care who committed the murder, and I cared less about Phil and Roger who were investigating. I couldn't recommend this novel."
2,"Mixed, very mixed","A good yarn, good plot, some interesting characters, but so badly written that I wonder if the author bothered to go back over what appears to be a first draft. Has he ever heard of a transition? Where were his editors? It did though drive to Amazon to look for an up-to-date Rockne bio (one due out this month) and found to my amazement a listing for a novel written by Rockne that figures in this murder mystery."
2,many errors ruin an otherwise solid review book,"This book provides a ton of good examples and solutions to help you master the subject matter. However, there are so many errors in the examples and problem sets, that you'll pull your hair out wondering if you're wrong or if the book's wrong (most likely, the book is wrong). No errata section on the website either to clarify."
2,LOTS!!! of Errors,"I am using this book right now to bone up on some algebra. The book is good for teaching processes. It does however, have editorial problems on nearly every single page. They are not subtle either. One problem has an = sign where there should be a -. I have found several problems where the author inserts a + sign when there should be a - sign, and then proceeds with the problem...thus giving a wrong answer. It is nto a matter of me not knowing what I am doing either. I will vex and vex over a problem until I fall out of my chair, realizing that the book is wrong. It is good from the standpoint that it forces me to really, really think hard about a problem to make sure I have it right. I don't think however, that was the authors intention."
2,disappointed,"This show is okay...if you like Pet Shop Boys. Adding a guitar would have made it a ton better, sadly, it comes off as one big dance mix. The 5.1 mix is good, but it could have been so much better with a couple of real instruments. Where are the shows from the mid-late 70s? Hope something surfaces soon."
4,Ok product,Will do the job. Kinda flimsey. About the quality I would expect for a product 1/2 the price. Don't buy this one just get one from a department store. Product and shipping costs not worth the item.
3,"FUN ,BUT ITS NOT A BANK","WHEN I PURCHACED THIS BANK . I WAS LOOKING FOR A FUN KIND OF BANK. THAT WOULD HAVE A KEY LOCK TO GET INTO IT. THIS BANK WILL LET YOU WIN ( NO MONEY JUST PULL THE HANDLE ). OR WHERE YOUR WININGS DROP INTO THE TRAY IT HAS A LEVEL TO PUSH ,MONEY JUST DROPS OUT. LOT OF MONEY FOR A TOY.I COULD HAVE PURCHASED A Slot Machine Bank THAT WORKS THE SAME $20.00Mini Mega Slot Bank, Slot Machine Bank LOOKS GOOD ,FUN. BUT ITS A TOY A CHILD CAN TAKE ALL THAT'S IN THE BANK . WITH OUT USING ANY MONEY.THEN I WAS LOOKING TO RETUN IT. WELL YOU WOULD PAY $24.95 TO DO SO ."
3,Too small,I brought this product for my mother for christmas. Although she loved it. It still looks a little cheap for the price. I am not happy with this product. I was expecting something bigger.
4,Usually I don't buy statistic books in a library,"I browse quite a lot though, usually ending up not finding anything worth buying. However this book offered the right amount of exhaustivity and technicalities, suitable for a businessman like myself. It also contains interesting material on the history of statistics. On some occasions, I would have appreciated to have more mathematical details, e.g. re entries related to regression."
2,"Maybe good for travel,","but not of much use otherwise. I know most people will rate my review ""not helpful"", since that always happens to negative reviews. But so be it.I wanted to replace my old Cassells dictionary which was published 1976 and therefore out of date. But as it turns out, this dictionary will not replace it. One reason for it, is that a lot of words are missing. This is understandable given the fact that it has only 400+ pages and my Cassells has 1200+. But somehow I missed that when ordering it, since it got so many good reviews. One other problem is that the words it contains, are not really explained and usually contain only one synonym, where in my Cassells it has a whole paragraph explaining the different meanings (and usuage) of the word.To sum it up, you get what you pay for. It is dirt cheap and it will be good enough for travel. But otherwise it is pretty useless.Maybe my review is too negative, but I have to counter all the raving reviews."
4,Great help!,"Used this book all of the time in my German classes! Wish I had had this sooner, would have made everything a lot simpler. Its easy to use, easy to understand, and great when you need to find something quick. This should be a book every college student, studying German, should be required to have."
5,A boon for a start up,"Ever go to a craft show where things are really selling? Except for that lonely person sitting behind a card table reading a book or knitting. This book explains WHY that's happening and how to avoid it.Ever try to sell things with a REALLY low price so they'll move? But they don't. Here you'll learn why that happens.Excellent points are made, many of which I never thought of,and great forms to use.But this is a case of GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out). Not the book but the buyer. For this to be worth the price the buyer has to be a person who can keep up with the DETAILS of a business. In other words, the crap work. If you're a ""Hey, dude, I just want to get out and make sawdust"" Neither this book, or selling for that matter, will work for you. Sorry.If you're NOT like that then grab this book. A clear winner.Anyway, that's my story and I'm stickin' with it. (-:If you're serious about being proficient in ALL aspects of making and selling a product then this is for you."
3,More for large cities,"I got this book because I'm now retired and wanted to expand my woodworking hobby into a part time business.While this book give good ideas of how to look professional , it seems to me , that its more "" useable "" in larger cities . While I agree that the work we do is very good , in the smaller towns , it is just not gonna work. IF I charged for my work the way the book is set up , I'd never get off the ground. So I just "" toned "" it down a bit for my area and it works fine for me. I only use this book as a guide line. I do like it."
5,This answers all you want to know,"Two months ago I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Carlson in person after which I bought two of his books. Knowing RR for over 10 years , I can highly recommend this book to anyone who ownes a RR or who is interrested in getting one. This book talks about origin , breed standard , feeding , training , sports and even has a few anecdotes in it that are really funny and show what life with a RR really is about. The book also talks about the position of the RR in the different countries around the world , including the USA. If however you are interrested in specific breeders and champions of the past years in your own country (like the reader from New England) , you should contact the RRClub in your country , because that is not why this book is written. This book is written for RR fanatics all around the world. Mr. Carlson knows and loves the RR just as much as I do and proves this through this very informative book , which is a pleasure to read."
4,Good Glove,"Fits well, wears down quicker than expected. If you play more than twice a week, you might want to get some extras or go with a stronger glove."
3,Not the best choice,"The faux leather part on your palm side actually makes the grip slippery and when you sweat on your palm area, after the game, the faux leather part become harder and wrinkled as you can see from cheap faux leather product. The mesh part is okay but I would not buy this product again probably."
3,it was ok,"It's ok, the mesh that covers the back of your hand is weak, ripped first game after a dive. Not holding up very well, but it's cheap and it works."
3,Stale cake,"This isn't a bad book, but it isn't a very good one either. Yes, I have kids so I can concede that her observations about chaotic childcare are accurate. Accurate, yes, but not original, thought provoking or more to the point, funny. Because this writer seems to have taken a stab at comic writing. My advice: Don't do it, you're simply not funny enough. Sabine Durrant is certainly no Marian Keyes.I kept reading this thinking it would pick up. It didn''t. The plot didn't really go anywhere and the ending was anticlimactic. I guess I mainly read it because I'm a UK girl living in the US and like reading about England when I feel homesick. But this book was like a long forgotten eclair you find at the bottom of your fridge, looks tasty but ends up tastingt kind of stale."
4,Page-turning fun and thought-provoking brain food,"Although I figured out very early what would happen regarding one key plot point, I nevertheless recommend this book as a good weekend read. The characters are believable, as are the situations and conversations. There are suspenseful moments, and funny ones, and of course, touching ones as well. Very enjoyable, on the whole.It's of the genre pouring out of England in the past few years -- I think Helen Fielding started the trend with the Bridget Jones books, although the books about Adrian Mole are in the same vein, and predate Fielding by awhile -- humor diarists writing winningly about everyday situations. Jane Green does a nice job, too, and the best recent offering is _I Don't Know How She Does It_. If you read that one, this book will seem a little flat, but still well worth reading."
2,Obvious,"This book devotes most of its descriptive energy to portraying the unfulfilled life of this underappreciated ""playground mum."" It's depressing enough to put anyone off having children, and given the many advantages of Maggie's posh lifestyle, it comes off as whinging. Somehow the playful element that might add a note of comedy is missing.You might think that things would be spiced up by the plot involving adultery. I will not give any more details here, but I don't think I'd be spoiling it if I did, because all of the developments of this subplot (including its eventual ironic, ""surprise"" twist) are completely obvious from the get-go. I cannot recall the last time I read a book this predictable.In short, the plot of this book is not nearly exciting enough to warrant spending time with its irritating narrator."
3,just so-so,"Having It and Eating It isn't a bad read. It is a fairly predictable book about a woman questioning her life as a suburban mom and her (not quite) husband's loyalty. When she meets her old school friend, Claire, she finds herself reexamining everything about her own life, and comparing it, unfavorably, to her perceptions of Claire's life. The book is fairly honest in its depiction of how Maggie feels rendered irrelevant by her full-time parenting job.But it was unclear to me if the book's big narrative surprise was really supposed to be a surprise to the reader. It's so obvious in its set-up (and I'm not a particularly clever reader).If you base your book-buying decisions on whether or not you're likely to want to reread, get this one at the library."
3,Depressing but absorbing tale of stay-at-home motherhood,"Durrant's story is well-crafted and well-written, but it's kind of a downer. First, it makes being a stay-at-home mom seem positively loathsome and tremendously unfulfilling (I'm not a mom yet, so I couldn't say whether or not this is true). Second, the fact that heroine Maggie is not married to her man Jake (but has two kids by him)seriously warrants some further exploration and explanation that we never receive. And even though Jake doesn't turn out to be the cad we thought he was, there are still some serious relationship issues that are never resolved.However, I did find this book engaging enough to finish in a few hours, so despite the problems I had with it I still consider it a pretty decent read."
1,Wouldn't buy again,My sons like it but it requires constant repair. The gel that 'catches' the pellets falls out often.
1,piece of crap,I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and the sticky park all ready fell off. So i think you should look for any other brand of target because this one is a piece of crap.
2,Smaller than I expected,I was under the impression this target was large enough to provide appropriate target practice for the airsoft guns I ordered.
3,Nice screwdriver but not for Macbooks,"I bought this for getting at the memory and hard disk on a Macbook. I'd recommend a shorter screwdriver with a #00 head. This one worked fine, but a 00 would work better. Other than that, really good quality and comfortable."
5,Sweet Book...,"Emily of Deep Valley was a sweet book. It was about Emily Webster and after she graduated from Deep Valley Highschool. Emily lived with her grandfather, a civil war veteran, in an old fashioned house across the slough. She goes to school with her own crowd and has some of the same teachers Betsy and Tacy had. Emily is one of those shy, sweet, and considerate charactures that every one loves. She gets you into the story with her longing to stay in highschool, and her longing to go to college. But she can do neither. She sees her friends come home for vacation from college. She finally decides to stop feeling sorry for herself and do something. She starts by putting her ""hair up"". This knocks off the whole story. As soon as the hair is up Cab Edwards, we know from the Betsy-Tacy series, begins to call on her and they go to dances together... I have one question though. When are they going to republish this wonderful book?"
1,No Substance,"I enjoy romance novels, especially Regencies. But this novel left me wanting and waiting for more story substance. Penelope and Marcus supposedly marry for convenience and eventually fall in love. But the details of their relationship were definitely missing. And in Penelope's supposed response to Marcus' advertisement, we are never told who truly wrote it or why. One more sub-plot that could have been nicely explored was Penelope's brother, James, and his changed attitude.As much as I love Regencies, I really cannot recommend this novel. Perhaps Ms. Bray's other novels are much improved."
2,Nothing to this book,"I really enjoy regency romances. But I have to agree with another reviewer that this book had no substance to it, at all. It started with some original twists to the ""marriage for convience"" plot, but it never went anywhere. I never felt connected to any of the characters. While the couple is obviously supposed to be slowly falling in love, the author never showed me why they would. They were one demonsional characters. There was no progression that made sense to me. I would not recommend this book. And there were holes in the plot - at one point the husband plans to take the cruel brother to task as soon as they return to Edinbourough, but then he never does. And all of a sudden the brother ""hates"" his sister - and she never had any problems with him for all her life until the few months of this book - and this antagonism is never satisfactorily explained."
2,A Quick & Light Read but Disappointing!,"Although the story line was intriguing, I found the characters half-formed and they failed to capture my interest. I could not understand the scandal that just because she was seen leaving the solicitor's office she was forced into marriage. Why was her brother so cruel after living harmoniously for so long? The brother's mysterious and spiteful fiancée behind it all is never met.I have found other Patricia Bray romances very enjoyable but this one had no substance."
5,Easy Guitar tabs,"You have to go back to the 60's to find guitar music that was popular without vocals. The Ventures, Chet Akins and Duane Eddy are about it. This book is written in what is known as ""Easy Guitar"" style. Any one with basic skills should have no problem playing Duane's style.Its to bad there isn't more than this one book."
5,Twang,"Great music book, I purchased my first guitar in 1958 with the dream of playing like Eddy. I may not play like Eddy, however I enjoy playing the tunes in this music book and yes it has tabs for those who use them."
5,thank you,"this kennel was a great price it was all metal even the try on the bottom.also it pop up and lock so it save me alot of time taking it down and putting it up over and over again,love it."
3,thinner wire,We have 4 dog crates in varius sizes...this one is the largest...either the wire coating or the wire is thinner than we've seen before...it works and is lighter than our others would be at this size.Don't expect to put alot on the top of this one...!
4,"They botched the ""Seven Gates of Hell"" !!!","How could they screw this up??? The ""Seven Gates of Hell"" was longer on the original vinyl E.P.(that I still own,by the way)with an extended fade out of CRONOS ripping his bass over and over screaming ""don't leave me locked away like this! Oh Nooooo Ohno! Ahhh!"" and it was my favorite part of the song!!! It should have been EXTENDED!!! ""The Seven Gates of Hell Singles 1980-1985"" CD also has this same edited version albeit a much LOUDER one,making it the optimal version out there until someone adds the lost 10 or 20 seconds back on to their metal masterpiece!!!"
4,barely sub classic,"this release, though certainly the worst of all the classic albums, still is amazing if only for the title track and the nefarious track ""cry wolf."" blistering, classic black metal - venom in their prime blew away all contenders."
2,Tastes change with age,"When I was a teenager I was convinced that Venom was the greatest band on Earth. Now, not so much. In fact this album apart from the nostalgia really sucks. The production values stink, the musical arrangements, for what they are, stink and most of the lyrics are pretty much comical. This isn't a band that ever relied on production values, arrangements or lyrics though so if you know Venom you know what you're getting.The long, almost 20 minute long ""At War With Satan"" is the albums only saving grace. It's still the best song that I can remember Venom ever producing and as far as I'm concerned it's the only reason to consider getting this album.I still listen to it occasionally when I'm in the proper mood but it's really at the back of the shelf on my players."
4,Great Venom for Fans Only,"I owned this album when I was 13-14, back in 1983-84. I remember it being much more extreme, but I guess back then it was! Now all the ""Satan"" stuff is comical, but still great to listen to. If you're a fan, buy it, you'll love it. But if this is an experimental buy, maybe try a used one first to see if you like it. Venom is an acquired taste. I personally love it, but I've been a fan for 26 years, too."
4,Another Great Primal Scream Album!,"It's hard to believe that this is the same Primal Scream from the albums ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Screamadelica"". They sound a lot like early Stone Roses, which came around just about the same time as this. ""Sonic Flower Groove"" is excellent, every song is short, pretty, and gets to the point. The only problem (which is why this is only a 4 star album) is that this just is not their masterpiece...""Screamadelica"" is. This is by far though, one of the best albums of pretty psychedelic pop songs I've ever heard. I particularly like the songs,""Gentle Tuesday"",""May The Sun Shine Bright For You"",""Imperial"", and ""Love You"". These are my favorites, but buy this album now (because it is really difficult to find for this price) to discover all of your favorites."
2,Out of round from the factory,Purchased these drums to replace the OEM drums on my Saturn Vue with 92000 miles. I put on the drums and I heard a 'ticking' sound coming from the rear whether I applied the brakes or pulled the parking brake. I could also feel this with my foot when I applied the brake. I put my original drums on and the 'ticking' stopped and hasn't returned (going on second day). Will try new Raybestos drums and hoping I have better luck.
5,Beautiful,"This book is, I would have to say, is one of the best works of fiction that I have ever read. It starts a bit grindingly but once they enter Kukuanaland the story rolls into motion. GET THIS BOOK"
4,An Exciting Adventure,"As an avid fan of Jules Verne's adventures (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, FIVE WEEKS IN A BALOON, etc), I was seeking another author who could take me places in my imagination that I had never experienced before. Here is another one of those authors. H. Rider Haggard's classic KING SOLOMON'S MINES is a fun adventure for just about any reader of any age. Though the adventure will be entertaining for an older child or early teen, it also addresses and portrays events of historical and social interest that will appeal to an adult. The British imperialist attitude is portrayed wonderfully in this tale. Also, the racism that goes hand-in-hand with British imperialism is found throughout the book as the native Africans are often treated like children who need to be cared for by the British. Loaded with realism, history, fun and adventure, KING SOLOMON'S MINES is a winner!"
3,Fun read,"Old-school British adventure novel. Well written and exciting, but be warned it uses colonial / imperialist language towards non-Europeans.If you decided to read the book based on seeing the movie with Richard Chamberlain and James Earl Jones, the book seems very different based on what I remember of the movie. Not necessarily better or worse, just a rather different tone and some changes to the plot."
3,Its alright.,"I read People of the Mist before this one, it is a good story but not as interesting as The People Of The Mist though."
4,Now this is a gem...,"This is a very rich and detailed narrative (by Alan Quartermain - a character in the book) about his quest to locate the mythical King Soloman's Mines. It is worth reading, if you enjoy historical advemture as it based in an era when the ox and wagon where used as modes of transport! Some readers may find certain words offensive or racist, but if you keep an open mind their use is justified. Great story!!! Just read it!!"
3,"Great Story, BUTCHERED text","I hate to give this a low review since it's such a good story. First of all, the story is a solid 4.5. This free kindle version is a BIG FAT ZERO! The text is butchered on my Kindle 3. Question marks replace spanish e's, and british pound symbols, etc. It was so distracting that I bought the HR Haggard Volume 1 for 99 cents. Go buy it. You'll be better off spending the 99 cents to have something readable, and you also get 4 of his books. In this instance, free is not better."
3,Good read,This book is rich with detail and adventure. I was forced to read it in a British Literature class and found myself pleasantly surprised as I read it's exciting pages. My only complaint about the novel is that it gets a bit boring when they are fighting in that war and I kept skimming it because it felt like it would never end.
1,Horrible book,"This book is full of the horrors of hunting and poaching for profit and sport. I couldn't stomach another chapter after the one titled ""An Elephant Hunt."" I love classics and have read my share of them; this is full of atrocious viciousness and the base human qualities that have driven species to the brink of extinction through pain and suffering. It is NOT an ""adventure"" to kill for fun; it is abominable."
4,Good adventure yarn,"Although fiction is not my normal fodder, I found this book to be refreshing. It narrates the harrowing quest of a few men for diamonds, for a missing brother, and for home. The villians were truly vile, the heroes were larger than life, and it was fun to be with them on their journey. No major theses were given, no important life questions were answered, but it made a few of my evenings a little more enjoyable."
5,An excellent adventure...,This is the second novel I have read by Haggard (the first was The People of the Mist) and it does not disappoint. I recommend it for those who enjoy adventure novels written in 19th century and early 20th century English.
4,Fun Reading,"Having heard about Allan Quartermain forever, I finally decided to try one of his adventures. I was not disappointed. The story, told by Quartermain himself, moves along very naturally. It is a great adventure story, with big battles, tough decisions, quick thinking, and life or death struggles. You do, however, have to have a little appreciation for the fact that it was written in the late 1800's, so some of the plot devices are predictable and the outcomes forseen miles away, but it doesn't detract from the fact that the book is a fun, easy read."
3,"Good Music, Poor Mix","While the music here isn't Larkin's best, it's still enjoyable. ""Caffeine"" is an especially fun song. But the mix is just horrible--full of harsh, overemphasized highs. Let's hope this one gets remastered someday..."
5,Awesome book,"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist was awesome. I loved the mandiballs. Probably my favorite part was when Zachary's mandiball bit Denny in the rear end and it had its temper tantrum. It was also funny when Zachary pretended to throw the ball at Denny and Denny flinched. I thought it was really creative about the group of animals with Eddy Abby. On the cover of the book it says book one so I cant wait to read book two. I am not really a lover of reading but if I find a book that is good, then I read it! I read this book in two days."
3,A good cyber-read,"Ms. Baird has a strong first showing in the realm of the cyber. She evokes an atomosphere hovering between the dark future of bladerunner and a fast-action comic book. It reads not so much like William Gibson as Neal Stephanson's ""Snow Crash"" with no ""net"" (at least I couldn't find it). The premise blurs the line between reality and movies, and she makes it work due to the technowizardry that exists in her world. What an interesting future!"
3,A little bit depressing...,"With the main character being a quirky, witty, intelligent, yet sarcastic and depressed thief who seems to constantly have PMS, one might already be forewarned what is in this book. Especially since it's written in first person.If you can get around the fact that it's based in the slums of science fiction, in a situation that depresses you from the start and never truly cheers you up afterwards, the plot is kinda good, imaginative, and well-written.There's also occasional profanity in here, and lots of references to other literary works and such that you may not get. A good read once you get into it, but there's better books out there."
2,Too many errors!!!,"This, like any other study guide, is good to understand what will be on the test, and how to interperet information. However, the practice tests are filled with errors. One question will have a picture and the correct answer. A few questions later, the same exact picture, but a different answer. I bought it for the AFAST, and the ""complex movements"" section is worse. Again, good for understanding how it works, but terrible practice tests. Two same questions, two different answers..."
3,Not as good as the ARCO Military Flight Aptitude Test,"I got this book as a supplement to the ARCO book, to try to assist me in taking the ASTB. The Cliff book was just like all the other cliff notes I have ever bought, a brief summary, and nothing much else. I would not recommend this book to help you take the test. The ARCO had a much better bank of test questions. Its not like the test is hard, its just the CliffNotes book isnt really helpful in preperation"
2,Not helpful for the ASTB!,I bought this book as an introduction to the spacial apperception and aviation information sections of the ASTB. There are so many errors in the book that I started the test more confused than I would have been if I hadn't tried to study. The spacial apperception test wasn't even close to the kinds of study questions in this book and the mechanics section was far less technical than this study guide led me to believe. The officer administrating the test told me afterward that they usually recommend the ARCO guide and now I know why.
1,Worst book ever,"Lots of typo, lots of wrong answers. If you check the back of the answer sheet, it might say the answer is C. But when you look at the explaination, it refers to B. Dont buy this book if you wanna become an officer."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is one of the most error-ridden prep books I've ever seen. The editors must not have been getting paid well for this one.There's at least one error on every page; and not just misspellings or whatnot, I found several instances where identical problems had different answers, and occasionally two identical answers were given for the same problem.Made everything much more complicated than it needed to be."
1,worth less then the pages it's printed on,"How a book gets published that blatantly screws up basic Newtonian physics I will never understand. If I had anything to do with the publication of this book I would be ashamed. The worst part is that people who read this book might be relying on it to pass one of the service flight exams, and it is so error ridden and filled with flat out wrong methods of problem solving(esp with kinematics) that it will actually hurt their ability to perform on the exam.Please do not buy this book. Get the Arco one."
2,poorly written test prep book,"I am in the process of studying for the AFQOT. I bought this book instead of the other test-prep books because it was the most challenging (the other books are apparently much easier than the actual test). All in all, there doesn't appear to be any single good book for the AFOQT. This book has plenty of typos, poor or no explanations, and oddly worded questions. I am not even sure if the author took any officer candidate tests himself. Buy this book if you want practice with electrical mazes, spatial apperception, etc. Don't buy it if you are trying to learn something new to you."
2,So many errors!!,"There are so many errors in this book. Its shameful. If you're a beginner trying to get an understanding of aircraft maneuvers based on gauges, dont bother with this one. It'll have you scratching your head!"
1,Awful for the AFAST,"The practice test bared no similarity to the actual AFAST:1) On mechanical section, there are no numbers on real AFAST2) The answers on the cyclic section are wrong3) The helicopter knowledge section was much easier (and more fundamental) on the actual AFASTIt's a waste of money and time."
1,I hope yuo read these reviews before purchasing,Just like everyone else on here I am so pissed off. I will NEVER purchase another book from this publisher. I dont care if its the best book inthe world. Absolutely no excuse. They should refund everyones money and do a massive recall. This should be against the law. Im so pissed right now that all I can really think about is swear words. Thanks for absolutely &^%^%$# nothing.
1,The Countess in Red,Dreary and SO poorly written I could have cried! I have seldom seen a work with such flimsy plot and utterly insipid characters. What a shame!
1,"Don't Count On It, Countess","This book is the biggest hodgepodge of melodramatic [garbage} I've ever seen. ""Curious George Goes To The Hospital"" looks like a masterpiece by comparison. Then there's the horrifyingly bad translation, which I can only describe as the work of a deeply disordered mind--Jacinthe Leclerc should either be checked into a mental ward or the Betty Ford Clinic (perhaps both, just to be on the safe side). In short, count yourself lucky if you don't read this one."
4,This album is better than people rate it!,"I would've given it a 5 except that the bonus tracks are just ok. The album proper, Futuristic Dragon (intro) -Casual Agent, is super tight and a definate Marc Bolan gem.It's more disco and funky but still retains that sort of trashy fun sound that's so loveable on 'Tanx'. I have 16 T-Rex albums which either makes me an expert or just plain crazy (probably both). This is truely his last great album. There are songs from the 1 or 2 albums afterwards, but basically this is the final complete gem of the late Marc Bolan!The second album 'Dazzling Arrainment' is pretty good as well. Some of the earlier paired down versions of songs on 'Futuristic Dragon' sound just as good as the originals but produced in a much more paired down raw format.In short: get these songs and listen to them immediately! It's good for you!"
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Futuristic Dragon is one of my more recent T.Rex purchases and is not one I have to play regularly. It seems as though this is a compilation of recorded tracks and aborted ideas between 1975 and 1976 and a tired Bolan put these tracks together instead of creating an album. Half the album could be the unfinished work of a concept album, hence the tracks 'Futuristic Dragon', 'Calling All Destroyers' and 'Theme For A Dragon'. I understand many of the tracks were recorded around the time of Bolan's Zip Gun and Bolan delayed the release of FD so as not to crowd the market. This would explain Mickey Finn's very audible bongos,which had become very hard to pick out in prevous albums, even though he is not credited in the album. Most tracks seem badly produced but in general this is a good album which lacks any real standout songs and originality."
4,If You're a T.Rex Fan....,"Get this album. It's not Slider or Electric Warrior, but it is definitely Bolan at his best. I often wonder where he would have gone musically had he lived."
5,Exceeds expectations,This is a perfect DVD player for all but the most dedicated home theatre aficionados. It has the cool features plus great quality at a great price.
4,Great for the Price,"The Toshiba SD-1200 is the best entry-level DVD player I'veseen. There are absolutely no problems with dual-layer discs... It'sDolby Digital, DTS & component colorstream ready, and has all the features you need to get started (3x zoom, camera angles, various screen sizes (standard, standard letterbox, and 16:9 widescreen )..."
2,Rob,"This player had good picture quality and sound, however, the unit boke just over a year after purchase. The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through. It is going to cost $150 to repaire and the warranty just ran out. Needless to say I will not purchase a toshiba as my next player."
4,It was good...,"until it broke. The repair technician said the laser pickups were made by Samsung, and a steady stream have been coming in for repair. It would cost (...)to replace, so I might as well buy another player. I've had the unit for almost a year now. Great picture, useful zoom for those too-wide movies, and adequate remote."
1,Beeps galore,"Toshiba DVD's beep annoyingly when you open the tray, close the tray, use the remote, and even beep during the movies randomly acccordingly to several reviewers. So if you are annoyed by beeps do not buy this or any other Toshiba DVD player."
3,You get what you pay for,"If you are like me, you aren't going to buy a DVD player toplay games with zoom, freeze frame, etc. What I believe most consumersare looking for are a well built machine that delivers a high quality picture and audiophile sound.The Toshiba delivers on sound and picture, but not on manufacturing quality.For [the price range], maybe I shouldn't be so picky, but here are my gripes:1. The tray is flimsy, wiggling up and down. 2. The machine weighs about 3-4 pounds. 3. There is a ticking sound while the disc is spinning that can be heard from my listening position 13 feet away. 4. The CD sound is better through the RCA outputs than the coaxial cable. 5. In order to return to a prior track, you have to double click the back arrow, and even then it's hit or miss. 6. On some occasions on DVD, when the movie starts, the audio is undiscernable. If the DVD is removed and then reinserted, this corrects the problem. This has been reported by others ..."
5,Great dvd player!,I bought this dvd and was amazed to have used it for many hours with no skiping and great quality every time. great entry level price! I think you should buy if your looking at a dvd.
5,Excellent Player for the price!,"I've been contemplating a home theater DVD player for a while. I've seen them all. The ONLY one I can say that is the best with the most features for the price is this one. The Toshiba SD1200. The zoom feature is cool if you don't like the ""wide-screen"" version and it's compatable with most TV's and Receivers. No need to get rid of VCR or Playstation, just connect to receiver, and connect receiver to TV. Great sound this way too. There are better one's out there of you really want to pay $600.00 or more. This one is better that just about all of the $450.00 DVD players and under."
5,Great player at a great price,"I was shocked to find a high quality name brand player at this price with DTS out, component video out, and lots of other bells and whistles (zoom, expanded black level, etc.). It compares very favorably with my 1 year old+ Pioneer 414, which cost me $100 more. Its ease of use and features had me banish the Pioneer to my bedroom!"
5,You can't go wrong with this player!,"I bought this player about two weeks ago and I am very impressed. Priced as an entry level DVD player this player has all the features anyone should need. I have mine hooked up to a Toshiba T50Z51 50-inch projection television with the component video inputs and the picture quality is impressive. An optical audio output should have been included on this player but the digital coaxial output works fine. (make sure your receiver is compatible)The three stage fast forward and reverse will make finding your favorite part in any movie a breeze and the zoom feature will allow you to examine fine details up close. As others have complained, larger buttons on the remote would have been nice but the compact size is welcome for some who have 4 or more remote controls for their home theater setup.I would recommend this DVD player to anyone."
2,Close but not quite,"I was really excited when I read a review stating that this is the best Track of The Vampire has ever looked on home video. This is true, but it's also missing a fairly substantial amout of footage. The second victims drowning on the beach is missing a chunk, the scene where the Sordi cathes the nightclub act of the stripper is gone, there's an obvious jump in the scene where one of Sordi's future victims is researching his history, and the murder of one of the models is also cut short. Add to this some pretty so-so audio and the annoying cartoon Drive-screen that the film starts out in, you may find this release of Track a bit disappointing. That said, that this found it's way on to DVD at all is something to be grateful for."
3,Worth it for the rarity,"Kind of a mixed bag here. One one hand, it's cool to be able to see these rare films again, and at a great price. On the other hand, the prints leave something to be desired. Also, the visual conceit of being at the drive-in, while cute, makes the mistake of shrinking down the first 10 seconds or so of each movie inside a cartoonish drive-in graphic. Future releases might want to keep the drive-in vibe, but leave the movies unscathed. The cartoons in between features and the additional trailers are a nice touch, though. Three stars just to see these rarities again."
2,Choppy,"I have not read Dr. Rodman's previous book on Winnicott's correspondence. However, this book seemed to me like an expansion of it. The effect of this style was to make the narrative choppy and uneven. While there were some tasty passages that inspired me to finish the book, these were too infrequent and distracted from by the over-reliance on quoted correspondence."
1,politically correct to the point of obsession,"On the substantive side, the dictionary is unsatisfactory because it does not have the pronunciation and the English part is British English (""boot"", meaning trunk), even for slang (to ""chat up"", meaning ""to pick up"").On the non-substantive side, this dictionary rarely misses an opportunity to give the politically correct cliche (environmentalism, for big government, etc) or stereotype (e.g., for men as violent against women)."
5,The adult world through the eyes of a child,"This book was written by an eight year old girl some time around the turn of the century. It is a story of courtship. The author had read many of the clasic novels on the subject. Combined with the experiences of a child, the result is a book filled with unintentional humour.The result is that her characters are at once children and adults. When taken for a ride in a cariage, her heroin kneels on her trunk and looks out the window, bouncing up and down in her excitement. When Mr. Salteena, whose ambition it is to be a ""real gentleman,"" is presented at court the Prince of Whales offers him ice cream. When he goes to visit London, Mr. Salteena sees nothing improper about sending the heroin to stay with the hero, unchaperoned. They fall in love and marry, much to the disapointment of Mr. Salteena who loves her too. He consoles himself by eating some of the wonderful deserts at their wedding supper.This is one of the funniest books ever written."
4,Arrived very fast,This was an excelent way of getting a CD that we no longer could find here. It arrived very fast and safely.
3,As deep as Donny and Marie used to not be.,"Another meh. Really about as serious and developed as some of the classic tunes offered by High School Musical, but since these guys might be out of high school (?) it's marginally better, or at least I can take it without wanting to fight someone. It's just throwaway pop, but that has its place, so after sampling a bit online I bagged it- shallow as it is, at least they're more original than the light hiphop schplack pervading my airwaves these days. Good for 12 listens, then it hit my shelf. I forgot I had it until I dug into my Amazon Purchase record and saw I never reviewed it."
3,Motion in The Ocean,"The songs inside this CD is not complete. Where is ""Don't Stop Me Now""??The music is not as good as Radio:Active, my favorite album from them.Average overall."
3,"The pigs don't look ""muddy""","The pigs are cute little pigs that squirt water, which is easy enough to accomplish. The ""mud"" disappears completely in warm water and reappears quickly. However, the pigs were a bit disappointing in that their dirt/mud is not dark brown as pictured. It's not even brown. It is more of a lighty applied pink/purpleish color, so it doesn't really look like mud or dirt. The color is hardly noticable on the pink pig."
3,Coralie Clement Salle des Pas Perdus,"Coralie has an extremely breathy voice, which, as other reviewers have mentioned, goes perfectly with the light-jazzy arrangements and simple melodies. On the title track and a couple others, ""Samba de mon coeur qui bat,"" for instance, her voice seems to make an emotional connection with the lyrics and the song comes across as catchy and thoughtful. On other tracks, though, where her voice doesn't match the lyrics exactly, the whole confection comes across as frothy, the kind of feathery pop that would evaporate in a spring breeze.It is an extremely relaxing record to listen to, but listeners who want something more substantive might prefer the Keren Ann CDs or Benjamin Biolay's Rose Kennedy."
5,belle chanteuse,"Coralie's voice is so beautiful and unique it pulled me in immediately. The music on this disc is sort of a lounge style--very laid back and calming. I liked that the tone of the CD was light. Even if you don't speak or understand French, it would be hard not to appreciate the beauty of this romantic language and enjoy this CD."
5,I never received this CD.,I never received this CD. I have been waiting for it for almost three months.
4,digitally remastered out of print copy,"The CD sounds great, very clear. Case was in excellent condition as was the actual CD. On the downside, it was expensive."
5,A Interesting Piece Of Music,"There aren't many Macedonian bands who explore the origins of music ethno sounds from the past and present of Macedonia.This is a haunting music that defines feelings that one may think he never experienced them.This is music made from exquisite musicians.If you are looking for mysticism then this is the CD for you.This is a perfect example of the beauty of Macedonian folklore mixed with modern electronic sounds that enhance the rythm.It's great if you really want to listen to it,but it's also great as a background music.Slip in the CD,lay down and relax and let the music take you far,far away..."
1,nice trainers........,the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they haven't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves. I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it.....and am just about to start the process all over again.....if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience.....second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - don't know whether i'll get the $116 (not including the purchase price which has been refunded now) that i am owed.....i think thats down to amazon....fingers crossed i guess
1,Damaged goods,"Ordered box of 12 of Surgilube Lubricant to be delivered overseas. Requested for better packing however not done. The entire cost of the goods is around $700.00 USD. When the good is delivered, the entire box is damaged and the lubricant are squeezed out of the tube. Was told that they are not responsible for the delivery of the package. Just want to share my experience with this firm. Will not order any product from this firm from here on out."
1,Not really the screw-cap version,"This product is clearly listed by amazon.com as the version with the screw-on cap, but I was sent the flip-top version. The manufacturer's box (holding 12 tubes) was clearly marked ""flip cap"", and that was what was inside. It was inconvenient and cumbersome to have to return it (but I did get credited with the purchase price when the return was received)."
2,Average 80's show,I'm a big fan of 80's animated cartoons. My pet monster hasn't aged gracefully-The animation is awful and most of the episodes are poorly constructed. The backgrounds are the only thing the cartoon has going for it (Nelvana has that problem with most of their cartoons). For fans of nostalgia only.
1,Dissatisfied,"I thought I was buying the stuffed toy, not DVD's. There was a picture of the toy sitting on a couch. I already had the DVD. Advertise what your selling."
2,Not so good,It looks obvious that it's not an ordinary bear because one can see the camera lens in the bear's eyes. Plus it needs a video player to record what happened during the day time. Video player and video tapes are not easy to get nowadays.
2,Not impressed at all...,"This was not at all what I expected. The picture is terrible. It is hard to get the bear to sit in a position that works for the camera. It says that you can see in almost any light, but you can't. The camera is obvious in one of the bear's eyes. This was a terrible purchase. I would not recommend it."
5,Love It,"This is a great Christmas album by Bryan. I love it. The minute I heard it I was ready to go Christmas shopping. It puts you in the mood. Holiday Inn, my favorite, reminds me that it could so easily be me or anyone spending Christmas in a motel. Keep up the good work Bryan!"
2,Very disappointing,I bought Bryan's Christmas CD. It was just fair. I am big fan of Bryan's and have several of his albums. I wouldn't suggest buying this CD. I give this album 2 stars.
1,Lackluster and boring,What is it with this guy? Christmas is about feelings and family. This CD has all the feeling of your mouth after a shot of novicaine. Poor Bryan is looking so desparatly for an audience that he's seems willing to look for it by using a production team that is more suited for Mariah Carey. If only someone like Robbie Fulks would record a Christmas album we'd be all better off
1,"No sir, I don't like it.","At the risk of sounding like a schoolyard bully, this guy sounds like a petulant little girl. I can see something like this being big in Europe. This kind of music sounds like it was made in a factory. There is no personality or craftsmanship. I wish Robbie Fulks would do a Christmas album."
1,"crystal looks pretty, but its ""rainbows"" are pitiful","crystal looks pretty, but its ""rainbows"" are pitiful. no good for rainbows. maybe nice as a Christmas tree decoration . This items was WAY better:76mm Teardrop Suncatcher Crystal Prisms #873-76"
2,"You got what you pay, Good size crystals",all 3 crystals came with small damage. I am Ok but if you want perfect one take this one serious.
5,Pretty !,I have purchased 5 of these now. They have a very beautiful sparkle and make many rainbows in my kitchen every afternoon.
4,COOL,"I bought me a parir of two crystal ball, i just wished it came with a string so we can hang it. NOte: These come from Tokoyo, so its going to take a while..."
5,AMAZING!,"GREAT QUALITY,HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IS GREAT TO HANG IN A WINDOW OR ANY AREA OF YOUR HOUSE TO GENERATE POSITIVE ENERGY"
5,Perfect!,These are the perfect size for any spot in the house. They look great in windows (kitchen and bathroom especially). They reflects the sunlight beautifully!
1,not so clear,the two crystals came to me shipped and packed very well but after it was opened both were nicked and chiped not very good quality control at all
5,Crystal Ball Prisms,I love my rainbow maker. Makes hundreds of rainbows. The price was so unreal that I ordered one for my daughter too.
3,"""Rhymes with Bagel;"" or, in a mouthful, running in circles!","Having just read the introduction (which is the theoretical core of the work), and having read a different translation, I can safely say that Sibree's translation progresses about as smoothly as one sloshing around in a Turtle(tm) pool full of runny egg-whites with three Sumatran carpet- sharks tied to one's back. This is an essential philosophical text; but try and get just the introduction (*Reason and History,* translated by Robert Hartman on Macmillan/Lib. Liberal Arts).For a philosopher that one must LEARN to read, like Nietzsche (which should hopefully give the Nazism alarmists something to think about), the translation (non-indexed) reminds me of driving without a steering wheel, or like showering in Los Angeles - not something you want to repeat. A good text in that it's the only complete translation of PH that I know of. However, caveat emptor re: the stuff classical translation."
1,Horrible copy for an academic text,"An OCR copy should not be the first copy to come up on Amazon's site. I ordered this because I was ordering roughly 30 academic texts and did not have the time to pour through each description. There is absolutely no formatting, no table of contents, no index and the footnotes are muddled for the most part. Considering that this is already a difficult work in German, let alone in translation, it is impossible to decipher in the provided format. Worthless in an academic setting and should not be at the top of Amazon's list when you search for the work.*This is not a review of the work itself, which is important for any understanding of Western philosophy."
3,"Interesting, makes one think.","Many scholars, much more capable than, I have discussed this book. I take the essential notion to be that history is comprised of mankind's struggle to gain the ""freedom"" that permits one to examine his/her situation and, through that examination, to realize his/her ultimate spirit, our ""Geist."" He sees a divine hand interwoven with this process. He believed the ultimate evolution of this freedom occurred in Europe. I suppose, in his day, there was some basis for this conclusion. But He died in 1831, long before WWI and WWII. I'd guess he'd have a different take on things after these conflagrations."
3,"Ok but not recomended,",This video has some intreasting thing and some disturbing. I think that it show and really over egzagerates the scary and mean parts of a big cat.
5,Relax Into Yoga for Seniors is a gem of a video!,"The creators of this video Kimberly and Carol do a fabulous job of conveying the benefits of a gentle therapeautic approach to yoga. In doing so, this video makes yoga accessible to all including older adults, individuals with physical limitations and those just wanting to explore the subtleties of yoga. The importance of breathing techniques and easy gentle movements are demonstrated clearly and effectively. This is a gem of a video which can be used as a guide for teaching classes to special populations, sharing with olders family members, friends or anyone who is challenged by yoga but would like to particpate."
5,Do-able Yoga,This yoga DVD is for quite good for those of us who have physical limitations (not just for seniors). Its a great place to get started on yoga practice. Love-It!
5,Excellent video for my yoga toolkit,"this video is an excellent addition to my yoga toolkit. As a yoga instructor, I want to have the necessary tools to teach a wide variety of class particpants. This video is very helpful for not only seniors but for anyone with movement limitations."
5,Essential techniques to help seniors feel better,"Carol and Kimberly's expertise in guiding people to understand and enjoy yoga movements is why I recommend ""Relax Into Yoga for Seniors"". This video demonstrates to everybody how to enjoy stretching, balancing, and strengthening through guided movements with and on the chair. Their gentle voices help ease seniors into postures that are correct and beneficial for continued wellbeing and improved fitness.'"
4,Great but...,"I love Louis Lamour's novels soo much. This one was even special in comparison to a lot of others of his, however, it saddens me to not be able to give it a five star. I was enjoying the book immensely for most of its pages, but the last 20 pages was like a let down for some reason. If only it could have ended better, it would have been one of my favorites. So, I give it a bitter-sweet 4 star. But don't get me wrong, it is still very much worth reading. You gotta enoy Lamour :)"
3,review,its always a pleasure to read novels by Louis l'Amour. i have read most all of his books(more than twice)
5,"And a movie, too.","In these books, the author shows that he has first hand knowledge of the area he is describing. He has undoubtedly done a lot of reasearch on these areas. Also, the names he uses are very unique."
4,Crossfire Trail,This is one of Luis L'Mours best books I didn't want to put it down and it is much better than the movie(no offense Tom Selleck)
5,"Excellent, straight up bio","Excellent bio on Woody Allen. There were so many people who were interviewed and they really gave a lot to it. It is great that so many of them are still around! fMy favorite quote was, ""See? He's an industry."""
3,I Liked the Bathtubs from Akron,"How convenient that Shangri-la has so much gold that it can afford bringing in extravagant outside goods like the bathtubs from Ohio. Apart from that obvious weakness in the plot, though, this is still a pleasant book, and the reason Hilton gives us for Shangri-la's existence -- a refuge for civilization during the next war -- is a haunting one considering the book's being written so close to World War II, and then doubly haunting considering its eventual nullification by the atom bomb (whose effects could reach Shangri-la and destroy it along with the rest of the world). The novel is somewhat long on talk and short on action, and all but the main character are too one-dimensional (hence I must downgrade to a ""6""), but you're still better off reading it than not. Certainly beats the heck out of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" and its like, both in content and delivery."
5,Invigorating,"Lost Horizon is a great novel. Hilton's grasp of imagery and diction really make this novel a fun one to read. Since reading this book, I read Shangri-La, a sequel to Lost Horizon by Eleanor Cooney. I must admit that I did not like that one at all-- and felt that Hilton's story was desecrated. In any case, I advise anyone with patience (the beginning of the book is not a cathcer) to read this book. A lot of philoshophy in this one..."
3,"A ""moderate"" book","True to the Shangri-La concept, the book - like the High Lama,Chang et al - has a moderate plot, is moderately paced & reading time is moderately short. Aside from the mysterious start (which caught my attention) & the famous ending (as shown in the film), there was nothing much in between except Conway's thoughts & justification of his indifference & patience - which perfectly fits with the Shangri-La lifestyle."
3,Great story,"Bought a used copy of the book because it was cheaper and it was heavily used. For good reason, the story is wonderful and very captivating. At 231 pages it's a fairly quick read too and I was unable to put it down.Well worth the read and I heartily recommend to anyone, especially if they're at all interested in the legend of Shangri-La."
2,Not much of a plot,"There wasn't much of a plot in this book. Nothing exciting happens, and nothing is deffinate. There isn't much of an ending either.. the only reason i kept reading it was because i liked the size of the book.. heh"
2,Not what I expected...,"""Lost Horizon"" is definitely not the best book I have ever read. It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave. This is the way the book ends, except for the Epilouge where Rutherford again talks about Conway and tries to figure out where he is. This book is definitely for those who like weird things. It was not the best book for my tastes."
1,I just don't understand,"No, I don't at all understand how anyone can assign even the first star to this putative literary work. I invested a goodly fifty pages without noting the first scintilla of action or intrigue, although I did suffer through reference after reference to 1920s practices and customs at Oxford--couched in impenetrable Edwardian slang. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, other than that I was bored witless."
4,Good,"I saw the film at a young age. Never forgot it then Oops I wanted to read the book, books are always different than the movie."
3,A good novel that never reaches its potential,"I expected more of an adventure story but really very little happens. Most of the novel is talking and speculation and once the big 'reveal' is given (and I guessed it as I'm sure most people did) I kept reading, hoping the surprise at the end would not be the surprise I anticipated. Well, it was.It's a short read but I can't say this one merits the word 'classic'."
3,Engaging Start Yet Losing Interest...,"Since Heinrich Harrer's ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (based on author's true story) and ""Return to Tibet"", I had caught myself in a reading spree on everything related to Tibet, whether fiction or non-fiction. Tehn I came across James Hilton's ""Lost Horizon"". I had to admit that the book caught my attention with an engaging plot that four people brought against their will to mysterious Shangri-La, set in the hidden mountains of the Blue Moon, a place where nobody ages. The mysterious and suspending plot is what makes this Hawthornden Prize-winning novel catchy and was made into motion pictures several times.Despite the splendidly written text, the storyline itself was not developed very extensively. Most of the text describes the story of Hugh Conway, who was trapped by the fascination of eternal life. The sudden and abrupt ending of the novel was somehow disappointing to me."
5,Great book,"Awesome book, very interesting, fairly quick read.If you are one of the people who believes that ""nothing ever happens"" in this book, then perhaps you need to take a step back and really contemplate what transpires in this book. Great books take a significant amount of contemplation to truly appreciate."
5,This is a good novel,"I am not much of a reader, but I like Hiltons style of writing. I got right into the book. Once I started reading it I hardly wanted to put it down. I think Lost Horizon is an excellent novel. I would read this book again."
2,"rare, but it happens","This is one of those rare books where a screenwriter improves the details of a book to come up with something better. In this case, much better.The plot belongs to Hilton, but if you want a much better story, watch the movie."
5,Intrigue,Hilton does what so many others wish to do. He writes the sublime novel in an attempt to provoke the reader. His style is fluid and mysterious. His message is powerful and at the time of the novel preemptive. He saw nastiness on the horizon and wished for something better. He found it in this novel. I leave the rest for you. I hate to give too much away. If you are of a certain mind you will love this book and love the questions it makes you ask yourself.
4,Make sure to get the right bonus tracks,"T. Rex / Tanx (Chronicles/Remasters 18 track version): Marc Bolan was always entertaining but this was not his best album. However, with this CD we are given some fine additions. ""20th Century Boy"" (one of the bonus tracks) is worth the price of the disc. Four Stars"
5,T.Rex Musical Departure still stands strong,"Tanx has the Tony Visconti-produced classic Bolan sound, but has lost the continuity of the previous two albums that vaulted Marc Bolan into British pop superstardom. The expectations on this record were enormous, and while Bolan desired to satisfy his teenage army of fans, he also wanted to be taken seriously as an ""albums"" artist. Hence, the end product is not as consistent as ""Electric Warrior"" or ""The Slider,"" but the songs that glow on this record are such phenomenal masterpieces that they carry a four-star record into five-star amazon.com territory. ""Tenement Lady,"" ""Broken-Hearted Blues,"" ""Shock Rock,"" ""Children of the Revolution,"" and ""20th Century Boy."" That is all I have to say."
3,It 's ok.,The picture for the transports aircraft's cd is good for the other cd some secene is good some secene is poor .
3,Pretty Good book for a not so great class,This book is pretty good for a text book about something that is not typically very interesting. It is very easily accessible to find information quickly.
2,The wrong book,I received my book 1 week late and it was due to the completely wrong book was mailed to me. The second time around I received the Teacher's edition which was also the wrong edition. The company sent me an e-mail stating that I can return the book for a complete refund. Although the book was the incorrect book twice they did promise to refund the money so I am moderately satisfied. However I had to purchase the CORRECT book at my college bookstore for double the price.
1,poor shipping quality,"its the right book, but the description was far from accurate. it said that it was in better condition than what i actually saw when i received it. the person did not package the book properly. they wrapped it once in a brown paper grocery bag. so when the post carrier delivered it, it was stamped as damaged and the only thing holding the book inside the paper was a rubberband. i emailed the seller as soon as i received it in this condition and no action was taken, this seller has defiantly lost my business."
3,"Not very strong, bends just below handle","I bought this skimmer to use for making cheese. It works very well for even small curds, and I do like the wide, shallow skimmer. However, when I press curds into a mold (and not very hard,just to get them evenly distributed into the corners), it bends between the skimmer and handle. It does bend back, but it's a bit annoying when I'm trying to use it. I also bought two other skimmers, they do not bend like this one does."
4,solid,"More than I wanted to spend for this style of kitchen utensil, but it is very well made, solid stainless and not tack welded at the handle like most. I'm quite pleased with it, but the rest of the junk in the ""tool drawer"" is jealous."
4,"Vampires, Zombies & Werewolves...oh my!","Packed full of supernatural and historical elements, this is a fun and entertaining read. Wilson combines these supernatural elements in a rather convincing manner with his WWII backdrop. The ending is pretty satisfying as well, and the whole book moves along at a fast pace. It's exciting and certainly a joy to read - though it definitely requires a rather major suspension of disbelief. I am definitely curious to check out Wilson's other books now!"
2,Not as good as it could have been,"Given the positive reviews, I thought this book would be better than it was. At first, this seemed to be a new and interesting take on the supernatural boogeyman-in-the-closet genre. Creepy atmosphere? Check. Despicable bad guys inexplicably dying? Check. Mysterious monster in the dark? Check. But then, the book took a sharp left turn into romance novel territory, which I found confusing (and annoying). The denouement was completely predictable. I anticipate reading another of F. Paul Wilson's novels before adding him to (or crossing him off) my list of authors to follow."
3,A Great First Half,I really liked the first half of this book. The second half of the book turned into a kind of horror-romance novel that I didn't like so much. If you like the idea of a horror-romance novel you'll probably like this book.
3,"Exciting and interesting, but not really scary","The first 200 pages were absolutely engrossing. I was gripped by the incredible suspense that Wilson manipulates to amazing effect. The ""Something is murdering my men"" line is pure horror genius. However, the villain is essentially revealed halfway through the book, and he ceases to be scary anymore because he is now ""out of the closet."" I will admit that it was still exciting, but it ceased to be a horror novel at that point, and became more of a fantasy/adventure. And the ending did not live up to the hype on the back of the book. A good read overall, but don't expect to be terrified."
4,Not particularly scary but has a good plot twist.,"The book was not as frightening or creepy as a Stephen King novel, but the plot was interesting enough and it had a good plot twist that I didn't see coming."
4,What a fun read,"I especially liked the bit with the messy sheet! And I enjoyed the transformation of Dr Cuza, the decrepit, disrespected and hugely underestimated Romanian Jew. Loved the ""monster's"" clever manipulations all around."
5,Six stars if I could.,"I'm not into horror; I'm a science fiction fan. And I have to say ""The Keep"" is one of the best books I've ever read of any genre. Read it, and disregard the movie. My friends told me that if I love the book, which I do, then do NOT see the movie so I never have. So even if you're not normally a horror fan, read this. Wilson's a master of description. You feel like you're in that cold, clammy Keep as the shadows and the night close in...."
3,Solid but predictable,"Sometimes it's hard to live up to the hype. The Keep is a classic example of this axiom. There is no need to rehash the plot as there are 60-something reviews that do just that. I thought the story was good and very creepy until the vampire (or whatever he is) was revealed. After that the suspense just fizzled out leading to a very predictable but entertaining finale. This was a decent horror story, but one of the greatest ever? c'mon, give me a break."
4,Much better than I expected,It's not a traditional Stoker vampire story but it's still not bad. after a couple of chapters it became a real page turner. It really is an entertaining read. I don't think anyone is going to say this is the their all time horror/vampire novel but it does what it sets out to do.
2,Eh.,"Without the love story, this would have been a really great creep fest. What a strong and gloomy beginning! But it seems to disintegrate about half-way though- like a vampire in sunlight. Color me one of the stinkers."
2,"A silly, overrated book","The Keep made for a pretty bad movie. However, until reading this book I had no idea that the movie was actually better than the source material. This story starts out very solidly, with a great premise and very nice set-up. About the middle, though, the book completely shifts and becomes a paint-by-numbers adventure story. I strongly suspected that the book was going downhill when the ""vampire"" made its first appearance to the old man and his daughter. It just took all the menace away from the proceedings. From this point forward, The Keep is just a silly, silly story with a conclusion so ridiculous and ""Hollywood"" that I could never recommend this book to anybody. Ever. It's lunacy that this book has such a high rating on Amazon."
1,Jaw-droppingly overrated,"About as scary as He-man fighting Skeletor, but not nearly as cool. Picked it up because it was recommended by an Amazon reviewer that liked it better than ""The Terror"" by Dan Simmons. Could not have been more disappointed. ""The Keep""'s premise is interesting. There are Nazis and something like a vampire. Sparks should fly but they absolutely do not. The writing is crap. There is no tension, no dread, no atmosphere. The characters are two-dimensional. The love story makes the Darth Vader-Princess Amidala romance in the recent Star Wars movies look sophisticated. The story itself is laughable; trite, boring and, most damning, not the least bit scary. How can so many people be so wrong? 5 stars? Amazon reviewers, j'accuse."
5,"An excellent good vs evil,horror,love story combination.","When I first read ""The Keep"" I was drawn by the historical time period involved. As I read on the excellent way that Mr. Wilson portrays characters,scenery,and story line in a most tangible way kept me spellbound for the rest of the book. Anyone who enjoys historical or geographical accuracy in a compelling story line will want to read this book. I've read this book numerous times,including once aloud for a friend . I believe this is one of my favorite books/stories. Definitely a must read!"
3,What's the big deal?,"After reading rave reviews of THE KEEP I felt compelled to check it out. Then, inside the book, I found there was a website. After checking out the message board filled with adoring fans, I started the book with high expectations. Perhaps that was the problem. The premise is certainly very original and the new spins on vampire folklore were very creative. I failed to find the story to be at all scary as I did in books like SALEM'S LOT. The mysterious ""hero"" who spends nearly half of the book racing to get to the keep because time is of the essence,does no more than sit in the bushes and stare at it for several days... I'll give the author one more chance with the next book in this series THE TOMB but I'll be sure to buy it...at a discount."
3,"Great start, disappointing ending","Nazis in a spooky castle contend with a supernatural menace.F. Paul Wilson's horror novel gets off to a great start, introducing contending Nazis leaders in a mysterious, ancient fortress located in a deep, fog-shrouded ravine. They struggle with each other even as they try to deal with a being that is killing their men one by one. In desperation, they send for an old Jewish scholar and his daughter, whose expertise on the keep may provide some answers. At this point, the book was a real page turner, but then a character who goes by the name of Glenn showed up and the story devolved into a morass of fantasy tropes complete with magical swords. Perhaps reading this with full knowledge of its context as a part of Wilson's Adversary Cycle is more rewarding, but for me it was an unsuccessful hybrid of gritty horror rooted in historical fact with a metaphysical cosmology that comes out of nowhere to provide an unsatisfying deus ex machina ending."
3,Not Bolan's Best - But it Has Its Moments,"Marc Bolan was a musical genius. Marc Bolan plus Tony Visconti was pure magic. This is Marc's first album after parting ways with Tony as Producer in 1974. The result is mixed, often disappointing. The only glimmer of the former T. Rex sound shows up in ""Till Dawn"" and ""Think Zinc"". The production is very weak and suffers throughout. Songs such as ""I Really Love You Babe"" and ""Golden Belt"" are utterly unlistenable in my opinion. On the other hand - ""Space Boss"" and ""Token of My Love"" are great! Even the extras cover versions are good. Gloria Jones' version of ""Dock of the Bay"" is surprisingly good."
5,Some Of Bolan's Best Work,"This is one of the best Marc Bolan's Best Works I was Impressed. What a shame he not here to Groove to it I like how thay put both Albums together. Man it ""BLEW MY SOCKS OFF"" Right through my shoe"
4,T.Rex .. Born To Boogie ..To The Music,"Very good CD is ""Zip-Gun"" but, again it ain't no ""Electric Warrior"" or ""The Slider"" .. but, it still can boogie, as good rock & roll with a sound you never heard before. Mac Bolan's, music, always worked for me ..so if you like a differ taste in rock & you want to roll, alittle, T.Rex .. may just be your trip. Enjoy the music of a time gone by. Thank You, Mac Bolan's or as I love to say, T. Rex's ... Thank You for the music."
1,Caution: Sail only in pool or bathtub!,"Exercise caution with this sailboat; I sailed two on a lake nearby ... both took on water (i.e. leaked) when heeled over which is what sailboats are supposed to do. The result was one boat sunk with no chance of recovery, and one boat inoperable due to water inside. Use only where you can retrieve easily.RC Sailboat Yacht Remote Controled Boat."
1,Very disappointing,"I received Charlie as a gift for my baby, the first one malfunctioned so I replaced it. The replacement also never worked. The colors are nice and bright, but never has had sounds. It is heavy and hard. After trying twice to give this a chance-I will never recommend this and think twice about other products from this company."
5,Great one from Robyn,"Robyn Hitchcock and The Egyptians / Element of Light (Rhino Records version): This is wonderfully written and is generally performed in a happy and lively manner, although he does have a few somber songs like, ""Raymond Chandler Evening"". This is a real treat. This album earns Five Stars."
5,An excellent solution.,"This book serves as a guide to peace with oneself - in my opinion, possibly the ""final solution"" to life-long problems with food and weight, and other similar matters."
3,Peaceful Weightloss through Yoga,"It was okay; however, it doesn't give enough information to know if your posture is correct, then it tells you to meditate and suggests you buy another book to find out how."
2,This item is to bulky and unstable.,"I ordered this organizer with the purpose of placing my containers of jewelry beads, wire, etc. to take with me on vacation. Of course I needed most of my things to create pieces of jewelry. The container wobbles when you tilt it back to pull it along on it's wheels. When you set it upright you think the bottom solid pieces that it rest on are going to break. I guess this would be okay for lighter items, but if someone was buying it for scrapbooking I think they would have the same problem."
4,A Very Smooth and Nice Voice,I just bought this CD and enjoyed it very much. I had walked in a music store where they were playing it and listened to her music for a while. I had to have it. Her singing voice is very nice and comforting to listen to. Hope to purchase more of her CD's in the future.
3,good basic overview of simple coaching approaches,"This a useful book which - although not a complete ""toolkit"" by any means - does provide a useful overview, and the beginning coach will find this helpful.I found the authors' continuing hard-sell of their own training programs more than a little wearisome. After all, I paid for a book - not a sales pitch. Far too much ego in places, but still worth buying."
2,pretty annoying,"When you stack the stars it makes the same sound every time. I love how when the big star goes on top it plays a song and lights up, but when my baby stacks the other stars, the sound is so repetitive it makes me nuts. They should have made it play different sounds."
2,Get Fisher-Price Rock-a-Stack instead,"The last thing a mom needs is a noisy toy like this when Fisher-Price's Rock-a-Stack is a classic toy that teaches the same thing, is just as fun and doesn't play annoying music over and over. I think too many toys play too many sounds now which is too overstimulating for babies. My 10 month old son has loved his Fisher-Price Rock-a-Stack for months. I will be returning this toy that we received as a gift."
3,Educational?,Call me crazy but isn't the point of the stacker to teach the children how to stack them from biggest to smallest. This toy has a straight pole for the stars. So the child could put them on in any order. I'd say the old one they still sell for half the price is more educational.
3,Not for me or my child,"This is definitely inferior to the Sparkiling Syphony Stacker it replaces. I thought I was buying the Sparkling Sympnony, but when I got it I was so disappointed! The songs are much shorter, encouraging the modern problem of short attention span in children. The musical selections aren't as good/interesting: some classical melodies have been replaced with nursery rhyme tunes found on every other baby toy. Yes, the melodies are cut off strangely. The ""ta-da"" sound is obnoxious - I really miss the twinkling, fairy-like sound of the other. It was so much softer and nicer for baby's ears."
3,Not as nice as the Sparkling Symohony Stacker,"The Sparkling Symphony Stacker played very nice musical selections and had a nice sparkly effect when you hit the top. Now, the star sings ""Da-Da-Da-Da"" every time you hit it, and it's annoying. Plus, the musical selections that are played are shorter than the selections played by the sparkling symphony stacker, and the way they cut the music is very odd.You're kid will probably like it, but you will quickly get annoyed by it. My 18 month old still loves his Sparkling Symphony Stacker and I still enjoying listening to it when he plays it. I think Fisher Price made a mistake with this new version."
4,It's a nice lovely addition to his toy box,"I read some people complianing of the music, doesn't bother us a bit. Babies learn through repitition. Our son really likes to play with this in the dark, he claps like crazy when he sees it. I do wish it had an on/off switch though. I also like that it's small and we can take it with us."
4,lots o fun,my son loves this toy so so so so so much its great if you hve company over and you want to get away from the baby It defenetly is a must buy
2,star stacker,"My son is 9 months old and has never played with this toy consistantly. He becomes bored with it easily, pulls off the stars, looks at the lights, etc and then discards. The most interesting part about the toy to him is that the top (the part with the smiley face) has a little hickey do kind of push lever thing in the lid of it that he presses with his finger over and over again, and really could care less about the toy as a whole."
3,"Good, but Over-rated","The title track is one of jazz' most famous tunes, making this is one of Basie's most popular albums. If that one song is all you care about, you'll be delighted. Taken as a whole, however, this album is uneven at best. It seems to have caught the band in between two eras. Half the tunes (eg.""Shiny Stockings"" and ""Didn't You"") have a soft syrupy sound seems quite dated, like the sweet bands of the 1940's. The rest of the tunes (eg.""Midgets"" and ""Dinner with Friends"") have a modern hard-driving big sound imitated by Louis Bellson well into the 1970's.Unless you have to have the title track, or are collecting all Basie recordings, this one is not essential. Instead try ""Atomic Basie"" as a better all-around album recorded about a year later."
5,TRUE DESERT ISLAND DISC,"THIS IS ONE OF COUNT BASIE'S BEST AND MOST FAMOUS ALBUMS, MADE BACK IN THE MID 1950'S WHEN HE PUT TOGETHER HIS ""NEW TESTAMENT"" BAND, A SCALED DOWN VERSION OF A TRADTIIONAL BIG BAND (NOW 10 PIECES). GREAT ARRANGEMENTS, GREAT ORCHESTRATION, GREAT SOUND AND A VERY TIGHT BAND PLAYING THEIR HEARTS OUT. EVERY SONG SWINGS TO THE NTH DEGREE."
1,"unfocused, boring","These are two short films. Neither has a strong point of view, neither adds very much understanding to how a conductor might interpret Mahler. I got through them as a public service not for any enjoyment. There are much, much better DVDs dealing with the subject of the meaning of music and the conductors art. Save your money, don't buy this one"
3,Vapid,Maybe worth checking out from the local library. Neither the commentary nor the stand alone performance make he purchase price worthwhile.
5,Clever and insightful little tale.,"Proof starring the gifted Gwyneth Paltrow is extraordinary. The film is directed by John Madden who also directed Paltrow in her oscar-winning performance, Shakespeare in Love. Proof also stars the legendary actor, Anthony Hopkins, Jake Gyllenhall and Hope Davis. They all play a vital role involving Paltrow's character who feels she is insane like her deceased math genius father (Hopkins). Her character struggles for sanity after the death of her much-respected father. Gyllenhaal's character is a former student of Hopkins and Davis plays Paltow's older sister. I like the ending, how the credits start to flow across the screen before the last scene is even done. Intelligent, low-key film. Check it out some time."
5,Proof is Oustanding,"going to see this film,i didn't know whether or not it was going to be worth my time. i ended up wanting to see it again because it was fantastic. the casting of the movie was very well done and gwyneth paltrow's perfomance, especially, was outstanding. this is a great movie with a wonderful story and feeling that is not just all about mathematics. Outstanding Film!"
2,Very good acting in a very bad cause...,"The idea that mathematical genius is somehow strange or crazyis very bad doctrine. People with power of innovation and originalthought are produced in the gene pool with regularity.They are almost as likely to be found among the pooras among the wealthy.Much of the real advancement of civilizations has depended on thembraving misunderstanding and persecution to bring their ideas forward.Contributing to their problems as this movie does,even with the very good acting is not a good idea.The Nash's of the world are seldom and very much not the ""rule""."
4,"not bad, watchable, good performance of ms paltrow","she played well as the role in the movie should be. not bad screenplay in addition to paltrow's performance, otherwise it won't hold the audience too long to hop into the next viewing room. ms. paltrow so far never disappointed us with her great performance and had obviously salvaged many films that were just okay instead of great enough. without her involvement, this movie is actually a quite boring movie."
2,good performances - weak story line,"The acting is superb - all four characters. The problem is that the story is based on an unbelievable premise and mental illness - even (or especially) when well portrayed - is just not very interesting. This is a kind of high-brow soap opera.Anyone who knows the University of Chicago will enjoy the local color. It is accurate down to the funeral in Rockefeller Chapel, the Midway, and even the location of the math department in Eckert Hall."
1,A disappointment,"Anthony Hopkins, whom I admire greatly,should hve been billed as making a ""guest appearance."" He is always outstanding, but billing him as ""starring"" in this with Ms. Paltrow is deceptive advertising at best. Go back and check oout his TV murder mystery with Blythe Danner ""Guilty Conscience""--the man has staying power. Better still, go back to ""The Lion in Winter""--Hopkins & O'Toole!!!!"
1,I'D RATHER TAKE A CALCULUS CLASS,"Sorry folks but in spite of all the acclaim lavished on this movie, PROOF is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a shreakingly one note performance, whining and pouting, and maybe smiling once or twice in a role that reeks of self-absorption. Only Jake Gylenhaal salvages his role, and Hope Davis is as annoying as Paltrow. Anthony Hopkins looks like he has gas, and the movie is about as exciting as reading an algebra text. Yuck!"
2,Seriously???,"I really tried to like this movie, with great actors in it, I figured it had to be a winner. I found myself hoping for something more around each corner, only to find disappointment. The continual jumping back and forth in time, drove me nuts. There were no peak moments during this film, to me, it just seemed to drag on, as I prepared myself to be jolted back and forth repeatedly. Sure, I found the actors believable, but I hated how the storyline was carried out. I think there was much more potential for it to be much more entertaining, but the the producer seemed determined to drag us through an unending torment. I found the movie somewhat confusing at times. This movie did nothing for me, other than make me wish I had spent my money on something more entertaining. I simply hate movies that wallow in pity, and despair."
2,There's a reason you've never heard of this movie...,"Reading many of the one-two star reviews pretty much sums up my feelings. The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor ""ever"" is barely seen and when he is it feels like ""Instinct"" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the ""tuh-duh"" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same. Proof is just a watered down version of a Beautiful Mind mixed with a high profile cast that prove sleepwalking and acting at the same time is possible."
2,Lots of talent wasted in a downer of a screenplay...,"I don't know how ""Proof"" worked on stage, but for me it just did not work well on film. Tedious is the word that keeps coming to my mind to describe how I felt as I watched it. I endured it, hoping minute after minute to begin enjoying it."
4,Strange But Interesting,"Great actors like Hopkins, Hope Davis and Jake G help this movie out in a big way. Great idea for a story, but it drags in some critical moments. Was a little disappointed in Gwen's performance.It's worth seeing, but you need to be patient with it."
2,Hopelessly Dull,Even my favorite actor Jake Gyllenhaal could not rescue this drab movie. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Katherine the daughter of a renowned mathemetician (Hopkins)who seens borderline cuckoo or brilliant (you decide). The father has died and the daughter seems to be battling a love hate relationship with her father's memory. A very long 90 minutes until the ending.
3,"...or should that be ""A Beautiful Mind""?","Like ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Proof"" attempts to create drama out of mathematicians who are losing their minds.Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as a ""nice-guy"" grad student digging through the notes of a recently dead mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) looking for any mathematical nuggets - the so-called ""proofs"". Gwyneth Paltrow playing the mathematician's fragile daughter, struggles with a character whose motivations and actions are simply not credible.""Proof"" betrays its stage origins in its overwrought speechifying and artifice. The revelation in the third act is not that big-a-deal and the denouement is abrupt. ""Proof"" has high-minded pretensions but is ultimately unsatisfying."
5,Excellent adaptation of the play to the big screen,"Proof is a great adaptation of the theatrical play to the big screen. The movie feels quite a lot like the play and so the audience is treated to intelligent dialogue and acting. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is, in my opinion, her personal best while Anthony Hopkins and Jake Gyllenhaal both give solid performances. This is an intelligent movie which delves into the love of a daughter towards her father and how such an obviously real human emotion can never be analytically proved."
3,A Beautiful Mind - Again,"Adaptation of a play with little action, but some decent dialogue. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a crazy daughter of a crazy math genius. The 'proof' is a math term. I was entertained, but this is fairly forgettable stuff. The sister has some nice moments playing down to the crazy one. You won't laugh and you won't cry."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I dont know where to begin - this movie is terrible I watched 50 minutes of it before giving up. Though Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenhal should make for a good cast this movie suffers from some of the worst dialogue and acting I have seen lately. Also, if there is anything about mathematical discoveries in this movie I did not see it. (I was kind of hoping for A Beautiful Mind moment that never came.) If you want to see a good movie watch Battle Field Earth instead. I wish I could give it negative stars."
2,Disappointing,"There is no beginning, no idea, no end in Proof. This is the worst film ever of Gwyneth Paltrow. Viewing Proof last nite, I couldn't help wishing someone else had played Catherine other than Paltrow. I thought Paltrow was a bit over the top actually in the role. Paltrow and Gyllenhaal had nothing together in terms of ""on screen"" chemistry. As much as I am trying to put my finger on what the problem was with this pitiful film, I have to admit that it was just about everything. The story did not flow at all. The dialogue did not work. Casting was poor. The sister of Paltrow was just ridiculous. 'd go on about how this film was excellent and get more in depth about this motion picture, but Gwyneth Paltrow ruined it, so I will save my typing and leave it at that."
2,Here now...,"Allow ol' Butterweight to weigh in here. This movie my feathered friends is a huge dissapointment through the eyes of Charlie boy, although you milage may vary. The character development is brushed aside arbitrarely as the authors assume their protagonists detain universal traits. The action is nowhere near as captivating as say that of Leathal Weapon (starring Danny Glover AND Mel Gibs). All in all a disappointment."
2,Ter-ri-ble.,"What more can i say? This movie is really really bad. Gwyneth Paltrow should NEVER play the inspired, mad genius type. (See ""Sylvia"") It's just so unconvincing. And pathetic.The only good thing about this movie is that Jake Gyllenhaal is in it. And he's hot. So...there's that."
5,"Good Edge, Strength, and Grip",Stainless steel clean and strength. It will outlive any marriage. This essential kitchen spatula makes the art of flipping delicate dishes a snap.
4,Small but good,"From the picture I was expecting something a little bigger. Its rather small! The spatula area is only 4 1/2"" x 2 1/8"" , from tip to tip it is 10"", so there is plenty of grip area. Works good though, I'm happy with it."
3,It is what it is,"Compact size is good for stir frying in small to medium sized pans or flipping silver dollar pancakes. Stiff blade. Not really wide enough for omelets, fried eggs, or burgers. The comfortable rubbery handle melts if left on the edge of a frying pan. Hardwood would be better, but then it wouldn't be Oxo. Yeah yeah, ya'll just gotta put everything in the dishwasher."
1,A rare OXO failure,"I am a huge fan of Oxo. Their products are typically very thoughtfully engineered, however, this one is a failure. The rubber handle is too thick and bulky to hold comfortably, and there is not enough flex in the blade to assist with proper flipping. The edge of the blade is too dull and thick to get under thin items like fried eggs or crepes. Sadly, we had to return this. Luckily, we discovered this gemLamsonSharp 3"" x 5"" TurnerIt lacks the beauty of an Oxo, but its brilliant design and functionality counteracts this flaw."
1,Rusted after first washing,"It seemed ok until I put it in the dish washer. The first time I washed it, it came out with a huge rusted area right in the center. That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel. Will not be buying any more oxo stainless utensils."
1,Not as described in picture,"the book is not as described, the picture show different from the actual book, I notice that after I received the book, try to avoid this seller"
4,Good laboratory manual on G protein-coupled receptor method,"Laboratory manual edited by Gary B. Willars and R. A. John Chaliss. Maybe the most forthcoming limitation of this manual is it's ""mission"" to cover a vast array of protocols. This becomes a shortcoming because the space given for each technique and the theoretical backgrounds that substantiate them are very limited (short). Compare for instance the information on receptor binding given by Sebastian Lazareno on this book and the same author's chapter on the book edited by Tatsuya Haga. On the other hand, many of the articles are from experts in their fields and as an overall evaluation, the editors and contributors improved over the first edition witch was very limited in terms of coverage."
3,good and bad,"Ok, the price is right for two ace sci-fi b-movies. Well the video is alright, I'll even say good. But the audio is HORRIBLE. I don't think I'd buy this if I had it to do again. Which is a shame because the films are great for laughs."
4,Not too shabby,I think that this particular soundtrack is much better than Isham's last effort the Blade soundtrack. If you want a dance music CD then this one is it. Definately a must have for your growing cd collection.
5,Some Real Gems,"This album showcases Queen's greatest hits from 1981 to 1991.While I prefer 70's Queen to 80's Queen , there are nonetheless some real gems here like the catchy A Kind Of Magic , the mesmerizing Under Pressure (A collaboration with David Bowie) , the rythmic Radio GaGa , the anthemic I Want It All , the rockish I Want To Break Free , the rock opera It's A Hard Life , the mournful Who Wants To Live Forever , the high energy The Invisible Man , the funky Hammer To Fall and the poerful One Vision .Together with the UK Geatest Hits I you get a great introduction to one of the 20th centuries greatest bands."
4,A must read,"While the book isn't a true story, the characters are based on real people Primo Levi met during the holocaust. It surprises, inspires and humbles the reader to know that humanity can exist in the midst of such horrible chaos.I liked the fact that there is not happily ever after, that the characters must fight to produce their own future. But, it is good to know that along their journey, they met many who would help them.Primo Levi is a wonderful writer. He stays true to character, winds the subplots into the main plot without jerky interruptions and allows the characters to be real, not stereotypes."
4,"Beautiful reproductions, great artist ..............","Beautifully done overview of the greater works of Gilbert Stuart.....and the special section of George Washington portraits is astounding. I've not seen some of these portraits of Washington before. As Gilbert Stuart is one of my favorite artists, this book is a real treat for me. The text is clear and well written and follows Stuart's career from the vantage point of his international residences. Anyone who truly loves portraiture will thoroughly enjoy this fine Yale University production. I'm hopeful to be able to view the originals that this publication promotes of Stuart's work scheduled to be on view at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington in early '05. This one's a keeper...........I only wish it was a bit more complete, though it certainly makes a valiant effort to present a fine sampling of Stuart's greatest work."
2,difficult to adjust size of band,"This is a beautiful watch and I was so anxious for it to come in the mail. However, I needed to adjust the band for my wrist and once I figured out how to do it the entire ""catch"" came apart and I could never get it back together. Neither could others recruited to help me. I had to return it unused--I was very frustrated."
2,Bad band,The two faced Skagen watch we purchased was a good buy but the owner needs 3 hands to close / secure the watchband. Not user friendly!
5,Duel-Time mesh watch,This was gift for my daughter at the holidays and she loves it!! Great price and fast delivery!!!
5,Stylish and functional,"A nice, stylish watch. Since it's 2-tone, it goes well with either silver or gold jewelry. I have fairly small wrists, so the watch is perhaps a bit larger on my arm than a normal watch might be, but it's flat enough so that it doesn't interfere with clothing. I personally like Skagen's simple, yet elegant styling that goes well with anything, dress-up or dress-down. Good price, and excellent, fast service."
3,Too big for wrist,"It's a pretty watch, but the watchface is long and the flexible band was pretty stiff just beyond the watchface - so the watch did not bend around my small wrist very well. I had to return the item."
1,"Classy Style, Junk Movement","I purchased this watch in April 2007 for my wife, who needed a stylish dual-time zone watch. Unfortunately, one of the clocks stopped working accurately within 1 month, and the other stopped entirely within 3 months. A watchmaker identified the problem as defective watch movements (not batteries, water or abuse). It is a disgrace that a company charging over $100 for a watch can't put in the same quality mass-produced Japanese movement that one gets in a $10 watch elsewhere (and which costs less than $1 wholesale). What good is style if the watch can't tell the time?"
1,mesh band problems,"I have this watch for quite some time and within one year I had to replace the watchband twice, now the third time it seems to have a stronger mesh link. It has gotten expensive every time to mail in the watch and spend U% 35.-- for a new band. I also just had it serviced and when it came back, my second dial is not working anymore. Very disappointed from Skagen Service after getting it cleaned (another U$.!!) to receive it broken bad."
4,Skagen Women's Dual time Mesh Watch,"Love this watch. I had it for sometime now,the only problem is the mesh wrist band,one of the link broke."
2,How It Used To Be Done,"This is a film that will appeal to sad people like myself who think that Jessie Matthews would be wonderful reading a telephone directory! Sadly it is of poor quality in terms of storyline and acting (or should I say over-acting) of most of the cast. A highly unlikely story but the sort that may have appealed to '30s film audiences and a pleasant change from all the blood and gore and gratuitous violence of the modern'blockbuster'! How it can possibly qualify to be released in a series of 'creepy thrillers' is beyond me, and it only had one song from Jessie!If it is old movies you want, it will keep you going but not leave you fulfilled."
3,"MY FRIENDS,THE SHADOWS",If you like those old creaky dark house mysteries then this is worth adding to your collection.There are some decent shadowy scenes especially involving the housekeeper and it's a pleasant way to spend a dark stormy night.
5,Great price for a great product!!,"I bought two of these uprights for $62.00 a piece. I ordered them in blue, but when I was contacted by Luggage Pros, they told me that they only had them in black. Because of this, I was given the newer model. For the money, these are absolutely great. They handle well, they are light weight, have many pockets for storage and are very durable. My last American Tourister is still going strong after 10 years and lots of usage. I will definitely be buying this brand again."
4,The Barbi Twins are great,"Playboy September 1991 is one-hundred and eighty-six pages. I read most of the articles with the exception of the Playboy's Pro Football Forecast (I am not a football fan), the Interview with Douglas Wilder, and 20 Questions with Danny Glover. The article on Who Made Danny Run? kept me asking who made Dan Quayle run for Vice President. The article most dealt with his grand-father Eugene Pulliam rise to fame in the newspaper industry then the article title. The article\pictorial on Tula; Tula only got one full frontal nude shot from the knees up. September's Playmate of the Month is Samantha Dorman and her pictorial is good. The only times she is nude is two back shots in her pictorial and her centerfold. The only thing that was really great is the Barbi Twins. With the exception of two pictures, they two were nude in all other photos. This issue left me upset a little. Playboy September 1991 gets a B+."
5,Excelent tome,This book provides insight into Sirach commentary for conventional bibles. Easily readable and understandable...suited my needs. Recommended.
4,Quirky humor & sad songs,"This is the disc that got her career going, mainly for the funny tracks. Her style is very sedate, and her songs are usually either very funny, in her own quirky way, or sad and contemplative. Most songs are about relationships, sex, and food, and not too bashful about either, though she never goes beyond the bounds of good taste."
2,It's not 5x7,"If you are looking for a 5x7 portfolio, skip this one. I bought it for times when I did not want to lug around my 11x14 portfolio and was expecting the same snug fit for prints. However, this pages are 5 1/4 x 7 instead of 5x7, so it actually cheapens the look of 5x7 prints in it."
5,Great for School Pictures!,I love these! I have been the 8 X 10 pictures of my kids in these! They are reasonably priced and very sturdy. GREAT BUY!
2,"""Thursday's Child"" Has Far to Go","The talented Gena Rowlands is, as usual, compelling, and Don Murray, an underestimated old hand, is also worth watching; however, the quality of the tape (it's twenty some years old) is a detraction, as well as the under par writing. Interesting to see the young Rob Lowe, of course, in one of his first roles. It's clear he will have a future. With Hallmark, one expects the overly sentimental, but one also should be able to count on a bit better writing. The siblings of Mr. Lowe's characters are never drawn out, in fact for the first half, it's unclear who they are. The redeeming features are the three main characters. Sadly, not what I expected."
3,A Huge AH fan weighs in,"I have enjoyed the artwork of AH since his gong days, thru U.K., I.O.U., Ponty appearances and up thru the NEW MILLINIUEM. But Sand is not my top choice of releases by this talent. I am wondering why - and I believe it stems from the ""wordy"" keyboard tracking. It's just too much. Not that that is a bad thing, but at times you wonder is that keyboard or Allan? They are interchanging lines, call and response etc... and the timbre is so close on both AH's guitar and the synth that it's really hard to distinguish. Now some may say that's a good thing! I contend that if AH wanted to sound like a keyboard player... he would have hired one... well... HE DID! I do derive great pleasure from listening to AH mind you... however; this is not one of my favorites."
5,35 minute Gem!,"I am guessing on the length of this CD. In my mind, Sand is one of Allan's best works ever! There is excellent use of the Synthaxe guitar with the encasings of a dynamite band. Allan, at the time of its release, explores new territory just outside of hard prog... but not really a commercial effort such as Avachron. This album stands out from his many wonderful records as being one of the most inventive releases with excellent flows and textures... and ofcourse, AWESOME playing by ALL! Fantastic spin!"
2,Not good.,There lots of notes wrote in most of the pages. Sometimes it is very difficult keep up with the literature.
4,dog treats,A good healthy food with glucosamine & chrondroitin added plus vitamin E supplement. His coat looks fantastic. He is getting older and I need to do whatever possible to be proactive in keeping him healthy and avoid joint and back problems and this product is one of the best I've found to get the job done. My dog eats them fast each time offered - no waste. Price is right too - 6 bags for $25. Cost more in dog stores.
3,my dog likes it,"I don't feel comfortable feeding my dog Chinese chicken product because of the bird flu and their contaminated water, soil, and air. The last big bag I bought was from Central or Sough America but now they're made in China. My dog is very picky and refuses to eat other natural chicken fillets from China but he eats this."
4,Hahahaha...,"""Compact Disc,"" ""Record,"" ""Cassette"". Seven songs, all one-word titles. Nifty gimmicks and ""Rise"" aside, this is a bitter pill. The drums all sound like they want to hurt the listener, and Johnny is an annoying pratt. I love it."
1,never recieved,"I initially only wanted to order ""compact disc"",by ""public image limited"" but amazon had a deal if I also orderd ""flowers of romance"", by the same band so I thought why not, I orderd both c.d.s' but I only recieved ""flowers of romance"",and not the ""compact disc"".I paid for both and only recieved the one."
4,Blank inside,"These were nice cards except they are blank inside. I didn't read closely enough to notice until they arrived. But if you are looking for nice looking cards to allow you to write your own message, these would be good."
1,"""Wildlife lounging around"" would be a more apt title for it!","I agree with some of the reviewers in that this movie has no real action scenes (beyond one scene, shot from a far distance, of many lions ganging up to attack an adult giraffe). The asking price of $3.25 for a new DVD (on Amazon marketplace) should have warned me about its quality and customer demand for it, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. Big mistake! Better to stick to wildlife movies made by reputed names like National Geographic or BBC.The camera work is shaky at times, the scenes look a little unreal and stilted, the ""plot"" is weak, and there is no real action. Avoid this film."
2,Not Quite what I expected,"Not a whole lot of action and not particularly educational. I was disappointed. From the title you would expect a lot more, but... If you are looking for something more inspiring, educational, and some great footage try the series ""Predators of the Wild"". They have at least three videos that are really worth watching."
1,Blah and Dull,"This DVD is missing all the action. The predators are seen eating and walking around but not hunting and making a kill. All the crucial action kill scenes are cut out and the DVD is very unexciting and the cover is misleading. They might as wellcall it, ""everything but the predators hunting and killing."" I am very disappointed at this very short DVD."
5,Worth every minute...,"While I already have most of these songs (and most of Runrig's catalogue) I absolutely love the fact that so many of my favorite songs are right here together. If you haven't heard Runrig, start here."
2,Confusing Glory,"This is listed as a collection of ""rare and 12"" tracks"". That's somewhat misleading. Out of 16 tracks, there was only one that I didn't already have on a Runrig CD. While this CD would serve passebly as an introduction to Runrig, new listeners would do well to search out ""Long Distance"". The liner notes do provide a somewhat detailed account of the band's history and the price of the CD is a plus. ... ""Celtic Glory"" could find it's place in a number celtic music collections."
2,Very difficult to read,"I used this book for the class Theories and Techniques of Counseling, taught by Jerry Corey himself. Very wordy book.. hard to pick main points out of text. Student manual helps some, especially for personal growth."
5,Great product,This book was everything it was advertised as. I was delivered fast and in good shape.
2,Not what I expected,"The book didn't arrive until well into the second week of class and when it finally got there I was expecting it to be in ""like new condition"" as advertised, but instead it has a lot of highlighting and post-it notes (which now do not want to come out easily) attached to the middle of several pages. I ended up ordering a brand new copy so anything I saved was more than lost by the time it was all over. It would have been better for me to have just gotten a new copy from the school bookstore to begin with. Oh well, live and learn."
3,Needs to be better defined,I am using this book along with the Becvar and Becvar book for Marriage and Family therapy. I found the book to be generally good as far as breaking down theories and explaining pros and cons. Because he writes each chapter the same for each theory after awhile everything becomes a blurr. I am in a highly accelerated program and this book offered basically a good explanation of all therapies.
1,Disappointed,"In ordering the PACKAGE for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy by Gerald Corey, I entered the ISBN # for the PACKAGE. I had declined several options for the HARDCOVER ONLY because I wanted the PACKAGE including the Student Manual.I received the shipment in a fairly timely manner. HOWEVER, I was only sent the HARDCOVER!I paid $10 more than I could have gotten that single book for locally right across the street from my college!I ended up having to order the manual separately from another seller.I was unable to contact seller because name given did not match what was on the shipment.My serenity is worth more than a $10 fight!I would not use this seller again."
3,Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy,The book was received in a timely basis. The book was in adequate shape. However almost every word in the book was underlined with several different colors of markers. I have never received a book with so much marker wear. I would not have purchased it if I had known how used it was. I do not remember what the condition was listed as being for this book. Therefore I cannot blame my purchase on the seller.
3,Only such a low mark because I've seen the new Edition,"This is a good book, but edition six is MUCH better. In edition five chapter 3 is too long and repetitive. Corey has also added a separate chapter on feminist theory in the new edition, which I think is important. If you can't afford the new edition, this edition does have great info, in-depth bibliographical info and is well laid out."
3,Lots of highlighting,"I purchased this book as a used text, and carefully read the review. Upon receipt, I was surprised and disappointed with the extent of highlighting throughout the book. This level of highlighting should have been pointed out."
2,Sizes run small,Size smaller than expected. Purchased as Christmas gift for nephew; plan on returning.
4,Black ep,"These early recordings of Impellitteri somehow serve as a demo, with probably not the best mix [distant vocals and guitar not close miked] hovever the four songs are top noch Impellitteri, two songs are still performed in concert today, It was this ep that told me Chriss had something special, Catchy hooks, Melody, Riffs, Speed Soloing. If it could be remixed with a bonus track I'd give it 5 stars. Buy this cd."
4,helpful,"Taylor's technical information was extremely helpful; giving me the courage to fire up 16,000 BTU's under a big stockpot of 400 degree oil! His suggestion for using potatoes to clean used oil was a great insight. After cleaning the oil, we tried the ""taters"". Yummy! Recipes are a nice addition to the terrific informative sections."
2,Not quite a sensory overload...,"I was really excited about ordering this cookbook for my dad since he just got a new deep fryer, but I was less than excited when I opened it up. There were no pictures, entirely black and white, and most of the recipes call for frying in a pan and/or wok. This was very disappointing. While I know that likely anything that can be done in the pan can also be done in the deep fryer, I was slightly disappointed. Hopefully it will at least give him ideas for new things to fry up."
5,fantastic cookbook!,"John Martin Taylor provides a wealth of useful information in ""Fearless Frying"". And his writing style is warm and friendly with lots of stories about the many people he has met along the way, and how their experiences have influenced him."
5,Not my favorite Puccini,"5 stars because of an excellent, fast-paced production. However, the first two acts, while presenting a good story, lack the musicality and excellent interplay of voices I expect in a puccini opus. The third act, which finally presents us with the kind of aria I look forward to from Puccini, almost makes up for the lack of such vocal interplay I enjoy, but the opera as a whole seems unbalanced in that respect. Still, a great story, with a more cohesive and believable plat than many operas."
4,La Fanciulla del West Daniela Dessi,"This performance, recorded live in 2005 at the 51st Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago, was directed by Alberto Veronesi, the festival's artistic director. The sets, by American artist Gus Nall, are spectacular. The video and audio qualities of this recording are fine. The major roles are performed by singers of great experience and renown. My personal reaction to all the singers was favorable, except for a few quibbles about the soprano, Daniela Dessi. I thought that, at times, there was a little too much vibrato in her long, high notes and a slight ambivalence of pitch. However, in view of her extensive experience in a variety of major operas, it may be that I am unqualified to judge such a renowned opera singer.In short, this recording is sung by important opera singers and will be a suitable one for opera lovers. Of course, I have a great liking for Domingo and Freni etc., but other fine singers must be heard as well.Ted Wilks"
1,La Fanciulla del West,"I bought this set based on the fact that it was an all Italian cast, with an Italian producer, conductor etc. It was a disappointment.First. The sets.Act One. The Polka saloon had a definite Art-Deco feeling, not at all what one expects to see in that area at that time. Minnie enters dressed more of less like a street-walker, wearing flaming red pantyhose opened almost all the way up to her hips.Act Two. Minnie's ""casetta"" up in the mountain has the same Art-Deco bar with more tapestry hanging here and there.Act Three. We are not in a forest but in some place with enormous bones standing from floor to ceiling. Minnie arrives to save her man wearing an outfit possibly designed by Lady Gaga.The singer look and act alright but the voices of Dessí and Armiliato often don't do justice to the music. Further more, the singers keep looking at the conductor.Torre del Lago deserves better."
5,Ditto da Bomb! Excellent.,"Excellent. As with many of my recent CD purchases, wish I had it years ago! :) Loud, high energy, funky, jammin', deep bass, sexy girls, DJ rappin keeping it all together, any serious dance-techno-rave fan will love this set. Includes their remake of one of my fave jams ""Jamaican Funk."" I got mine for $2.99 inc. shipping, but I would've paid more than that. This collection is great! I first heard of QCD from another Amazon-driven '...those who purchased this cd also liked this one...' purchase of Jock Jams."
3,Would have been rated higher if we had got the FULL LENGTH version of Atom Age Vampire!,"""Bloodlust"" was a bit boring but watchable enough.""Atom Age Vampire"" suffered from the picture not being clear enough, (I know it's old, but surely the picture could have been remastered or whatever it is they do to old movies to clean up the picture quality) but the main gripe was that it was only around 70 minutes in length, when the original movie is 105 minutes! To add insult to injury, they show us a trailer for the movie showing segments that are missing from this version.Surely someone could get their act together and release this movie in its entirety? It is so infuriating knowing so much is missing."
5,Great Spoon!,The item does what it's supposed to. It seems very well constructed and is a more sturdy piece than many others. I got tired of flimsy plastic spoons bending under any weight. This one holds up. Highly recommended!
4,Interesting,"Interesting, but I have not finished the entire book yet. The translation is fine and I think this should be taken in context with the entire set of scriptural books."
2,Disappointing,"This book does not supply the credible witness regarding the ""luminaries"" that I'd hoped for: i.e., marking time by the stars. It has plenty of curiosities.---------------------I'm not one much for reviewing political, religious or other controversial subject matter. I read some of it but don't care to be categorized simply because I want to know what's out there. On such material, I'll likely give 3 stars since there's not a no-comment option."
5,surprised by 3 things,"I ordered this book, The Book of Enoch, on April 9, 2010. A nice surprise when the book arrived was the book's final page that says ""Made in the USA, Lexington, KY, 10 April 2010"". A freshly printed copy!Surprise #2 was found on a beginning page...""Forgotten Books takes the uppermost care to preserve the wording and images from the original book. However, this book has been scanned and reformatted from the original, and as such we cannot guarantee that it is free from errors or contains the full content of the original."" I wanted a ""full content"" and probably got it. It is a beautifully done book and I'm glad I blindly ordered this edition.Surprise #3 was a note in the back of the book concerning many books free to read on their web site. On going to the site, it appears that you need a membership to read them but you don't. A very nice bonus! Lots of books there among my interests.This book company is ""Forgotten Books""."
4,Review,"As a religion and philosophy major I studied the Bible and other texts but we never covered the non canonical books such as those in the Apocrypha. This book focuses on Enoch, one of the books not in the Catholic canon and also not in the other reformist churches. it is an interesting read and highly recommended."
2,not really a toy,"I don't know why this is for age 8 and up like other Breyer horses. Breyer clearly labelled the box as not recommended for children..not a toy. It is a collectible model. My 11 yr old son has many Breyers and even at his age likes to really play with them. This is something to look at which is a little frustrating. As it was a very generous gift we will keep it, but its really for adults."
2,Cute but cute doesn't cut it in a busy kitchen,"Usually OXO produces well designed items that have you thinking ""They *really* thought about how this thing was going to be used (and abused)!"" Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles. It's a shame, but you should pass on these."
4,Very good with one minor problem,"I love metal measuring cups for one reason. You can use them on the stove. No you don't cook in them. But if you need 1/3 C melted butter, you measure it into the cup and put it on a low burner. You can heat water for softening gelatin. If you don't care about making another dish dirty then use plastic measuring cups. But I would rather have 1 set that has more ways of being used.I also like the grippy handle and the balanced feel of these measuring cups.The one problem is that the handles bend sometimes. If you make a deep scoop into packed brown sugar you may have to straighten the handle afterward.I'm OK with straightening the handles occasionally because I like them so much otherwise."
4,A little tipsy,"I bought these for my sister for Christmas as she loves to bake. She complained that they tip over because of the weight and length of the handle, so she returned them for some others. She loves the matching measuring spoons though."
3,"Love Good Grips, but these handles bend","I am a huge fan of all things Good Grips. So I was excited to find these great looking measuring cups. Overall, I have been happy with them - the great feel of the Good Grips handles I have come to know and love was expected. The shape of the cups is nice, and I thought I would like having the sturdiness and durability of metal.However, like many of the other reviewers, I found that scooping is not easily done with these measuring cups. Scooping flour, sugar, and the like out of the bag bends the handle. It is easy enough to bend back into place, but each time I worry about how it weakens the overall product. I know that I'll only be able to bend it back into shape so many times before it will need to be replaced. I am happy to pay a little extra for a Good Grips product in general, but not if it won't outlast even my inexpensive, plastic equivalent kitchen tools."
2,OXO let me down w/ flimsy handles,"I really like OXO products. I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles. Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups. Well I finally got them. I was very excited to use them for the first time. Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending. I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are. I think I'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO, I had better luck with them."
2,Disappointing,"Yes, the handles are surprisingly bendy. It is true that they don't bend as much if you hold them down by the cup instead of the end of the handle, but on the other hand, what is the point of getting ""Good Grips"" if you can't hold it by the grippy part?Also, the 1 cup is just that tiny bit too wide to fit comfortably in my kitchen drawer. Those of you who don't live in apartments, or who have kitchens less than 20 years old or so probably won't have this problem, however.I got these as a second set of measuring cups, because in some recipes you just don't want to stop in the middle to wash up. I thought I wouldn't care that it didn't have the 2/3 and 3/4 cups in it. I was wrong. If you're thinking the same, think carefully."
1,You'll need a good grip as these bend in your hand!,"I'm usually a big fan of OXO products. However, the necks are not strong enough to support the cups and they end up bending easily, particularly when you are using them to scoop something. Unfortunately, this problems has been noted by reviewers for several years and OXO continues to ignore these complaints. I've had mine for several years and was very pleased to replace them with AMCO brand measuring cups that are well made and well supported (purchased at Amazon). Don't waste your money on these ... you'll be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"We bought these measuring cups to match our stainless steel and black kitchen in addition to our liking of OXO products. We haven't had a chance to use them enough to test the strength of the handles, but after 1 washing the metal cup rusted. I am not interested in cooking with rusty products. These are going back to Bed, Bath, and Beyond for store credit!"
2,Too bulky; too weak,"I have always liked Oxo, so am surprised by this product. I received these as a gift to replace some 20+ year old measuring cups, because my husband thought they look so sturdy (they do). but they bend EVERY time I use them, for sugar, flour, everything!! And they really are too big to fit in the drawer, which is silly because there is no reason for the handles to be THAT bulky...since they aren't strong anyway. I think they bend so easily because the handles are so long, making the force on the cup higher, but as someone said, if you cant use the handles, what's the point. I hate to replace new (expensive) items, but I use them every day and am not happy."
2,whimpy handle,"I love their products and granted I am the first to admit I am not a cook but I think scooping out flour from the bag with the one cup measuring cup shouldn't bend the handle. Plastic cups can handle it, I would have thought metal would do it too."
1,Not up to Oxo's usual standards of quality,"As previous reviewers have already noted, the handles are not strong enough and they bend easily when scooping out brown sugar or even flour. While you can bend them back, it's still an annoyance and makes these unacceptable. The basic idea is great, since there are times when you need measuring cups that will scoop (unlike glass Pyrex measuring cups that are better for ingredients that you pour). However, since these do not really do the job, look elswhere. All Clad and MIU France (made in China, in spite of the name) make similar measuring cups and they receive positive reviews."
1,Bad Measures,"I tried to review these at Macy's where I bought them from after following a link here but they don't allow bad reviews on their site. If it's bad - they time you out and won't let it post. Since I started here I'll review here. I didn't get a chance to check the handle issue. I checked them for accuracy because the 1 cup just didn't look quite right. I was correct. It is off in measure nearly 1/8 of a cup! I checked it against Pyrex, Pampered Chef and another OXO measuring cup. All measured true to each other but were way short of 1 cup when dumping from this cup into them. I measured liquid and I measured dry to check it out. Sorry guys - these are heading back to the store immediately."
2,I expected more from Oxo,"I bought these on a whim at Target, and figured I couldn't go wrong with stainless steel and Oxo...I should have done my research 1st. The handles bend fairly easily--like when I was scooping a cup of flour out of its bag--and the colored numbering on one of my cups has smeared and worn off! Very strange, I've only handwashed them so far. If these were under $10 I'd give them more stars, but for $20 definitely not worth it."
1,Hate these.,"It took one swift ""whack"" by my toddler and the cup was flying off the handle. I'm tossing these and I'm sorry I've ever bought from OXO, with all the problems I've had."
4,Excellent tool,"Solid piece of cooking gear. Cleans up very well after sticky, gooey syrup. I like this and the measuring spoons.I believe in spending a little bit more on good kitchen gear, and I would not hesitate to buy this again, and look forward to giving it as a gift, too."
3,Measuring Cups,These were a shower gift so I can't comment on them. They seemed kind of heavy to me so I would not get them for myself but the bride wanted them ;)
5,Rubinoos = Pop Masterpiece,"Another wonderful Rubinoos release, which features a new album of typically sharp power-pop studio tracks and a second live CD taken from a 1992 show. The live show sounds like an audience recording and so it's not as pristine as some may wish, but it's still a great treat and you'll feel like you were there."
5,Good Start,"Wil's first album is a great start for a very thoughtful, provocative songwriter. Not a lot of people know, that when Wil isn't touring with his band, The Aliens, he's usually found in the far reaches of a public library studying arcane languages from a dead culture, let's hope he keeps mining these nuggets... Let's hear it for the next Cap'n Johner and the Aliens tour!"
4,An Other Of My Favorite Album By Nanci.,"For The People Who Like Nanci, They`ll Understand Why I Like It. She`s So Cool...."
5,Her best album??,"I have all of Nanci Griffith's albums and I keep coming back to this one. The songs are phenomenal: thoughtful, piercing and beautifully crafted. It is great to hear Nanci's voice without lots of electronic instruments.Julie Anne is probably my favorite on this album (and among my favorite songs from her).I'd highly recommend this calm, adult, pure folk album."
3,Not a great story,This book was a little dark and reading with my daughter was off key. It may have fit better 20 years ago.
2,"Rally Navigation ""Advice""","The title says it all. This book is filled with ""Advice"" from the experts but there is hardly any information on actually navigating. I have read this book and heard a lot of nice stories but I am still more or less clueless on what to do. I am rating this book 2 starts because it lacks information on how to navigate."
3,not what I was looking for,"I guess we were looking for something that was not so english eccentric, ie. wanted something with more US Rally info ... our fault for not thinking about what we were ordering. Perhaps a bit out of date ... considering what we have at our disposal now, ie. GPS."
5,Impressive and Unexpected,"After hearing Pete Townshend's solo stuff for the past 20 years, its amazing how different Wire & Glass is. Its an actual Who song, not Daltrey singing solo Townshend. The rest of band, not Moon and Entwistle, not even Starkey and Entwistle, plays well and with enough energy that these songs snap and pulse. I think this is the first time I could appreciate Pino Palladino's playing, as he doesn't have a legacy to compete with.Daltrey sounds older, but no less assertive than when he was in his prime. He has learned his new voice and uses it well. Jagger and many others could learn something from him. There is urgency and conviction as Daltrey lives the lyrics. Just as it was 30 years ago, there is no better voice for compelling lyrics.If radio wasn't so over-controlled by mega-corporations, playing the same 100 song set list on every station throughout the country, Wire & Glass could be huge. I can't wait for the album."
2,"Meet the new songs, same as the old songs","I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong."
4,The Who is Back,"The Who has no right to be this good, with Townshend being 61 and Daltrey 62. At first, I was a little put off by the reviewer that claimed it was something like the best of Face Dances and the worst of Quadrophenia. But hey, the best of Face Dances (You Better You Bet, Another Tricky Day) makes it far better than anything on It's Hard and half the stuff on Who Are You. And the worst of Quadrophenia is better than most bands' best stuff. I know this is only 11 minutes, but it's as good as anything they've done since Who By Numbers. My only regret is that I wished they had included the lyrics, and I wish each snippet was a little longer. Mirror Door is the only full song in the bunch. Like a lot of reviewers, this CD gets better and better each time I've heard it, and I've heard it about 10 times in the last three days."
2,come on!,I like the who and they've done lots of good stuff but bits of six songs? Lame. What's the big deal? Let us hear a song all the way through at least. You old Who fans...Pfftttt! Pete & Co. played too loud back in the day. Yr hearing must be a bit shoddy!
3,"Regarding ""Honest Opinion""","Amazon's claim that these are snippets of some of the songs from a larger LP, ARE CORRECT. I give this three stars just as a middle grade / to not sway the other reviews, but FWIW the actual LP will be released on Halloween. This is not the full album that people have heard."
3,Get it live,"Check out The Who's website for soundboard recordings of their concerts and you can get a live version of this album plus some other Who stuff--twice the price, but four times the music. The Who are releasing all of the soundboard recordings on their current European/American tour. The first two UK concerts are the only European ones that contain songs from Wire & Glass, but they are playing some during the US part of the tour."
1,SORRY BUT IT IS A RIP,"I love The Who. But damn people ...someone ripped us off on this one. a buck a minute is too much to pay. We got ripped. The material sounds promising... but come on, the music industry is just too greedy here."
4,The Who Are Back!,Overall very good. Sounds like old Who (Tommy era). The whole CD came out on 10/31/06. Very Good CD. If you are a true Who fan you will like it.
2,"decent music, but $12 for 11 minutes?","The music is very good, townshend continues to write great songs. I'll buy the album when it comes out, but charging $12.00 for 11 minutes of music strikes me as a bit mercenery. Wait for the full cd"
3,WHO's BACK!,"Being a big Who fan I awaited this release with great anticipation and rest assured that while this isn't quite in the same league as Tommy, Quadrophenia or Who's Next, it is several steps in the right direction!The only real downside to this EP (and the subsequent album) is that it feels and sounds a bit fragmented, as if some of the material is little more than snippets of a bigger idea or concept. Just when you begin to get into some of the tracks, its on to something else..Perhaps in this day and age when everyone is force-fed soundbytes and the average attention span is measured in seconds this isn't a bad thing..(?) regardless, If you are a Who fan, there is enough here to warrent the purchase..Better yet, buy the ALBUM and pad the nest eggs of two old Sheppard's Bush Geezers who continue to stir the hearts of rock fans around the world! 'Oo, 'Oo, 'Oo!!"
3,Will We Really See a CD in October?,"There is unparalleled chemistry present when Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey create music together. ""The Mirror Door"" is pure Who, but ""Wire and Glass"" merely scratches a surface for me.Pete plays like he did 30 years ago, and the fire still burns in Daltrey's voice, but this EP is a tease at best. In a time when the Rolling Stones have just put out (arguably) one of their best albums in decades and other older artists have realized that their art can improve with time, Pete Townshend seems afraid to produce a complete work. The Who's touring has seemed to me to improve over the years, but in my opinion you don't add to your legacy by just touring (sorry Dead fans).Anyone who has read interviews of Pete or Roger in the past 10 years knows they've wanted to make an album, so Pete, Roger - make one already! And then make another one. It might end up being one of your best and adding to that great legacy."
4,4 star set,"i been waitin on this since Pete started sayin new album 5 or 7 years ago. but screw that. anybody that likes The Who is gonna like this mini set. i,ll call somethin bad if i hear it. Like Pete said. ""This is good music"". if yer a fan o the Who Get ready cuz some even better stuff is comin. this 1,s nice as hell tho.i dont know why i aint got no voting buttons"
5,Movies for gays...not gay movies. There's a difference!,"Love it, love it, love it - short, sweet, funny, smart. Or as I like to call it, ""the best bathroom reading book ever.""Oh, and my copy of ""Can't Stop The Music"" is on its way from Netflix as we speak ;)"
2,Not bad but better books on gay movies out there,"This is quite a neat little book on gay movies, kind of a stocking filler, a light read although quite nerdy in tone. I have been buying lots of books on gay cinema from amazon as needed to research the subject for a project. The best I found to help me with this was ""Out at the Movies: A History of Gay Cinema"" by Steven Paul Davies. It covers the suject decade by decade and is an insightful detailed hisory of how gay films have evolved over the years. Plus has far more detailed reviews of many more films. Hope this is helpful to others who are into gay movies.Out at the Movies: A History of Gay Cinema"
2,Help me somebody Please!,"I love kc-i&jojo, but I can't find their old gospel albums for anything, if anyone knows where I can get tehm please email me! As far as this album it's pretty good!"
2,Firesign watered down,"OK, it did say in the first review that there was an audio only portion, now that I've read it again. But I didn't get that at first glance.They REALLY mean audio only. So if you're thinking you're going to see the troupe perform live on stage..no! What you'll see are photo stills for each piece they perform. Get it, Audio only. So imagine my dismay when I gave my hubby this as a surprise thinking he'd be so entertained seeing the live performance of his old favorites. I kept thinking I had run the DVD incorrectly but, no, it was a STILL PICTURE WITH WORDS. The bio of the group was informative and fun to see. So buyer beware. ""Everything you know is wrong"" This DVD turns into a CD."
1,A disgrace,The blurbs and cover photo are highly misleading. There is no reunion or performance here. An utter disgrace. The manufacturers should be sent to Sumatra in order to be devoured by the Giant Rat who dwells there. Do not waste your cash.
3,ALMOST great,"I lost a microbead pillow over the summer (which I loved) I figured Amazon was the place to find a replacement. I did indeed find one, which arrived in it's usual timely manner (I have Amazon Prime) I was very happy until I discovered microbeads IN MY BED. Upon inspection I discovered a small hole (Ah ha! The bead escape path!) I took my handy super glue gel, put a dot of it on the offending hole and now all is well (a bit unsightly but no beads escaping)"
1,I felt sabotaged,"It's too bad that Griffin has become a factory like Tom Clancy. I am certain he had nothing to do with the writing, and the only reason he lent his name to this book was for money. I doubt I shall ever read another ""by WEB Griffin and ....."" novel again, much less buy one."
3,It's just OK,"The story line almost feels like a ""filler"". There's not much happening, and you know that it could be covered in the first couple pages of the next installment."
1,Disappointment,He must have needed the money -- this was written with his left hand -- no suspense whatever
2,The Saboteurs,"If I had known that the audiobook release used a different reader than the voice from all the previous books, I would not have purchased the audio book.There is a legacy that was created with the voice used for all the previous books. It 'belongs' and the expectations are that this is continued.It is a major disappoinment that a different reader was picked. Quite a let-down, I have to say."
5,Another great W.E.B. Griffin novel,"As I expected, this was another ""I can't put it down"" novel by a superb author. Also as I expected, his charactors continued without interruption from previous books in the ""Men at War"" series (and for the first-time reader, there were ""fill-ins"" about each main charactor). Couldn't wait to receive it and now I can't wait for his next novel in any one of his series. Griffin, in my opinion, is one of the great American fiction authors of the century."
3,Not up to par.,"I am a great fan of WEB Griffin, but this one just doesn't come up to his high standard."
1,Poor excuse for a Griffin novel,"The book is poor. No suspense or follow through. The stories go nowhere. The characters are the same which is enough to buy the book. The prose seems mechanical. Much more description of the contents of a room or office then the content of the subject matter. Actually boring and reads more like 2 or 3 chapters of a magazine article then a stand alone nove.Mr. Butterworth (probably the real author of this book) needs a lot more editing and help. The best thing about the book is that my copy came in large print version. If the followup which I am reading now is as bad, Mr. Griffin will have to take charge again."
5,Mr. Griffin keeps the suspense rolling,I really enjoyed this chapter in this story line. I enjoying following along with the characters as they fight the axis. I hope to read many more in this series.
1,Not up to his standards,"This was the weakest of all of the W.E.B. Griffith books that I have read. I think the co-writer of this book was really the primary writer on this one since it really did not feel like Griffith's other novels. The character development was lacking and the ""heroes"" of this novel were really by-standers throughout the book. I never really felt involved with them and they were never really involved in coming up with the resolution. The resolution was through the stumblings of the villains and not anything positive by the ""heroes"". I felt that the ""heroes' were not even the main characters of the book. Overall, a very poor imitation of Griffith's past works. PLEASE write the next one yourself!!!"
1,The Saboteurs,"Don't waste your time nor money on this ""short story"". Griffin, sadly, is going the way of Tom Clancy and his Op Center fiascos. Using his name to foist another writer and this book upon his loyal readers reeks of greed. As a devoted fan of Griffin, I never hesitated to buy any of his novels, but this ends that knee jerk faith. Once the excessive descriptive verbage is stripped away, the plot and story line is simplistic and uninteresting. This is a sad departure from entertaining books such as The Corps."
1,What happens when you don't write it yourself.,"Big, big disappointment. Not up to standards. Just ends with about a half dozen subplots unresolved. I assume the son wrote this book--at least that's what I choose to believe. If Dad wants these series to continue--and we readers hope he does--then find yourself a good co-author and don't have your son continue. At a minimum, get him a good editor."
1,Worst Ever,"I have read all of Griffins books and have enjoyed each and every one. This ""book"" is a complete joke. The promised story about Sicily is an afterthought at the end of the book. There is no character development and subsequently I didn't really care about what happened to them. Of course because nothing really happens we don't need to care what happens.Griffin should be ashamed of himself for putting out a piece of junk like this with his name on the cover."
2,Are the old favorites authors just too old?,"I have read every book authored by W.E.B. Griffin. I almost could not believe that he wrote such a poorly constructed novel. Then I saw that now he has a ""co-author"". The co-author did not help this book. The story was disconnected, characters weak in their development and lacked any form of tempo. I can only hope that the fault lies with the co-author. The only alternative is that my favorite authors are just getting too old. I saw this in my youth as C.S. Forester, Alastair McClean and Graham Greene lost their touch. Maybe it is I that is just too old."
2,Would rather keep waiting!,"This was nothing but an attempt to cash in on an old series he abandoned twenty years ago. At least a third of the characters were left out (what is happening with Jimmy and Cynthia?) and it was just a short, contrived dissapointment. The rich story lines and character work that I have come to expect from Griffin were nowhere to be found. A waste of time and money."
2,Where is the rest of the book??????,"I've read ALL of the Griffin novels and normally keep checking with Amazon for new releases. I immediately bought ""The Saboteurs"" even before it was released. When I received it in the mail, I immediately thought something was wrong. The package was not as bulky as it usually is with Griffin books. When I opened the package I immediately noticed the book was about half the size of a normal Griffin book. That should have been the first clue. I finished the book, and felt that I was robbed of the other half of the book. The story ended aburptly and that made the book a waste of time........Sad."
2,Saboteurs was a let down,"I've read a great deal of Griffin's novels and have enjoyed his writing but I was most disappointed in Saboteurs. He builds great characters only to unceremoniously and quickly kill them off leaving you to wonder why he spent so much effort telling you about the character. The title characters are sacrificed seemingly early in the story. About 20 pages from the end, as a second story develops, one wonders how it can possibly take place in the remaining pages. It doesn't. Instead of the great storytelling one expects, the writer breezes over the storyline to a rather abrupt conclusion. I'm sure there's a sequel in the works, but I won't be buying it."
1,this one's the worst,"All Griffin books are pretty much the same, and I've read them all. This one lacks a cohesive beginning and a decent ending. It's like they cobbled it together out of other stories, parts deemed not good enough for past books. They were right. The resolution of this story, both of the saboteurs and the Sicilians are laughable, and implausible. I'm glad I got this one at the library, because if I paid any money for it I'd want a refund.This is for die hard Griffin fans (like myself) and even then, not for all of them. At least I got some sun at the pool when I read this."
1,It's hard to believe this book is from W.E.B. Griffin,"After 20 years, this book clearly shows that the master of military fiction/history has allowed the torch to be passed to his son and clearly posses little if any of his dad's skills. From the basic story, which is o.k. to the descriptive tools (weak at best), the story ends with nothing. It just ends, as though the author had something else to do and didn't have the courage to say good bye to the listener. It's horrible. I really hate to see this book and having waiting for a new book every year or two for many years, I now dread another (which I'll buy as well I'm sure). Any reader, who has followed any of his five series, will be greatly saddened by this book; I'm sorry for the great writer, William Butterworth, we've come to know and love as ""W. E. B. Griffin"")."
3,Not one of his best,"This was not one of his best by far. After finishing it, I loaned it to another Griffin fan and without telling him my opinion he felt the same."
1,Needed a copyeditor,"I agree with the first review: Candidy spends too much time in the bathroom, and the descriptions used to flesh out the story are just tiresome. Butterworth is overly fond of the word ""signage."" This book needed a decent copyeditor."
2,The Saboteurs (Men at War) by W.E.B. Griffin,"This book was not nearly up to Griffin's original standards. His name may be on it but I suspect William E. Butterworth IV, whose name also appears as an author, must have done most of the writing. Character development, plot, and overall qualilty of writing are not what I would expect from a Griffin novel. Characters which have appeared in earlier books in this series appear again, but it is just not the same. Griffin either needs to start writing himself again or get out of the business. His cohorts don't have his talent."
2,Son is not the father.,"I have been a fan of W.E.B. Griffin for many years and generally buy the hardcover rather than waiting for the paperback. This time I made a mistake. Griffin is obviously trying to pass the baton and the income from his franchise to his son. However, while Griffin is good at character and story development his son is not. In this book the German sabatours in the U.S., who should be the cream of the German intelligence operation, do stupid things so they conveniently get killed off. There are a number of instances of happenings which beg to be developed which just aren't. Particularly, the hero facilitates the escape of a number of Italians from the clutches of the Germans. This just happens with no associated story development. Needless to say I was disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I am a veteran, a pilot, a professor and a former cold war warrior. I have been a great fan of Griffin's books because they were technically accurate -although his knowledge of instrument flying is twenty years out of date--and they remind me of situations I have been in and of people I have known. The Saboteurs is a disappointment. Mr. Griffin's books were interesting in part because the characters were real and that may be because he was writing from personal experience based on people he knew. The characters in this book are flat.A very minor point; in the previous books, Eric Fulmar was not illegitimate. I can only infer from this that Mr. Butterworth needs more supervision. Still, it was a fun read and one can only hope that Mr. Griffin will be a more active participant in writing the sequel."
4,The Saboteurs (Men at War),"Good plot with pertinent diversions, lulls only to catch you when you are least looking to further the main story line.Good character development and very good historical fiction accurate to the actual facts."
1,Do not read.,"Wow, what a way to kill a series of books. I doubt Griffin even read it, let alone co-authored it. The characters are flat, the storyline is boring. What is the plot? On going characters from earlier books are simply left out or they are only mentioned briefly. Do I even bother reading the next book?"
3,not the same,"We all get older and it is nice to have a son who can follow in your shoes and eventually take over writing ""your"" books for you. However, the Griffin books that are being written by this father and son team are rather disappointing. They just do not have the style, flair or ""don't put me down"" compelling readability of the ones written by W.E.B. himself.These collaborative effort books are still better than 60% of the other books with similar themes on the market, and we still buy them."
1,Terrible,"I would have given zero stars if that rating were available. I have read over twenty of Mr. Griffin's books. Usually I can't put the book down until I finish it. ""The Brotherhood of War"" series and ""The Corps"" series are excellent. This entire series has been mediocre at best. This book was absolutely TERRIBLE. Don't buy it or waste your time reading it. I'll try another series from Mr. Griffin, but anymore like this one and he has lost a reader and a fan."
1,Incredibly amateurish,"This is a plodding, badly written book, with endless descriptions that serve no other purpose than to fill in the space allocated by the publisher. There is no sense of finality, no plot, and no excitement. Made for the money, I suppose, or to give junior a leg up in the business."
4,Back again,Good to see the series pick up again. Good collaboration between W.E.B. and his son and look forward to the next installment.
3,Edge of Battle,The book was excellent but Amazon double my order so had to pay to return 4 books. Amazon ordering system needs serious help or I won't use it again.
1,Worst of all Griffin's books ... by far!,"I look forward with bated breath for each new book by WEB. WEB rates high as my favorite, then Clancy and then Cussler and then a gap to the rest. I have read all but a few of the Cop Series, and reveled in each. An old Marine I am still in love with the Corps Series, and even the Soldier Series. All of the series are great!But the Saboteurs not only falls short, it does not even leave the starting gate. Characters - weak at best. Plot - barely interesting. Intrigue - non existing. Ending - it just happens to run out of pages ... you feel nothing ended and there isn't any lead to another follow up book or masterful end to a villain.I hope this is not a reflection of the end for WEB. What ever Butterworth added to this book is unknown ... unless it is primarily his and WEB just gave his counsel. That would be even worse.Tex"
2,waste of time,I've read all of the Griffin books but the Badge of Honor Series and I felt Grifin took advantage of his readers loyalty with this book. The scenario he set was great but the story never went anywhere and the heroes never did anything. It was just a lead in to his next book
1,WEB has lost his groove thing.,"I've bought my last WEB Griffin book after reading everything he wrote for many years. The Saboteurs confirms that his recent releases were not accidents, they were in fact terrible."
1,I'm only left with the memories...,"I have read just about everything W.E.B. Griffin has written, and at least twenty of them I've read twice. Having been a huge fan of the Men at War series and Dick Cannidy especially, I was SO happy when this book was released. Unfortunately, I have to say that I wish I'd been left with the memories of an excellent writer, because the reality of this writing is that it is boring, repetitive, spends far too much time on every single detail with little time spent on the actual plot, and an utter disappointment. We all get older, and sometime talent flags as we do - but this book would have been better had it never been written."
3,Good insight about Hoover's FBI but little else,"So far I have been disappointed by the latest books of Robert Parker, Jack Higgins and Clive Cussler - all former favorites of mine, but they seem to have lost their ability to write a good story. And now Griffin seems to be joining this list with this book. As one reviewer put it, this story which begins with some promise goes nowhere. Hopefully this is an aberration for Griffin from his past books because it is the first of his works that really is not up to his usual standard.It remains to be seen if this is so when his next book appears.The only reason I give this book 3 stars is the insight it has on J. Edgar Hoover's mindset in dealing with presidents and other federal government agencies. I am a former FBI agent who served under Hoover. Griffin has Hoover just right in this book."
3,Not his best...,"I generally avidly devour Griffin's books, but this one seemed to lack a little something - hard to define, but the characters weren't quite as sharply written, the dialogue lacked somewhat and, when it came time for the action sequences, they were frustratingly skipped over in a couple of instances. Granted, most of his series have left a lot of the combat out of them, but this one was a big hole in the book. Also, it's getting to be a bit annoying when the tragically rich lead character loses the lady love of his life - See Col. Lowell in the Brotherhood of War series, Detective Payne in the Badge of Honor series, et al."
1,A Disappointment,There seemed to be an inordinate time to set the various scenes--sometimes too detailed.....This is not a typical WEB Griffin.
3,Griffim sabotaged by Saboteurs,Griffin was the last of the authors I would buy hardcover editions when they were released - no more! Co-authoring has changed the pace of Griffin's story-telling as it has to other top selling authors.
1,Boring,"As a avid fan of WEB Griffin its sad to report that this is not his work. Its a collection of pointless prose. The story line is absent, without destimation. There us no romance, honor, tension, clausable actions or solutions. Names of previous charcters are used but they are shadows, not real characters. The best I can say is that the type is big and the pages few."
5,THE SABOTEURS,"As usual Griffin is the greatest story teller of all time. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and didn't want to put the book down. Also, as usual, I hated to have it end. Keep writing Mr. Griffin."
3,Admirer of WEB Griffin,"As usual a page turner. Griffin does not disappoint his lp\oyal or new readers, although the SABOTEURS lacks his normal tempo and story telling. Yet, the detailed saga, the human emotions and the historic background provide excitement all Griffin's books are rich with."
1,"One word, boring.","I have read every book written by Griffin and I felt that it was painfully obvious that he did not write this book. I normally read his books very quickly, usually completing in a week or so looking for every opportunity to get in a chapter or two. However, with this book, I could not get myself interested or excited to read it. It dragged so much and there just wasn't any suspense. Some parts were anguishing to read and I *gasp* found myself speed reading through parts so that I could move on to another book. I cannot recommend it. I do however recommend his earlier series of, ""Brotherhood of War"", ""The Corps"", and ""Honor Bound""."
2,poor excuse for Griffin book,"I am a avid fan of WEB Griffin, I believe I've read every word he's put in print. This wanders around ultimately gets lost and is a waste of time and money. Obviously he did not proof the final book. Next time I'll wait and buy a used copy, YOU keep your money,"
2,Half a Book,"This book reads as if it's only half the story. It's literaly half the length of Griffin's other books (about 250 pages vs. a typical 500 pages). It reads as if Griffin was forced to tack on a quick ending in order to meet a publication deadline. What happened? My guess is that this book was largely written by his son who is a new novelist and perhpas a slower writer than dad. He could not finish the book on time, so the publisher made him quickly come up with an ending for the half finished book so that it could go to press on time."
1,Sad disappointment,"I bought the book, read it and then sat down to write a review (never done this before). Then I thought I would read what other people thought of it. I was very surprised to find a few (very few) who thought that it was a good read. I am WEB's greatest fan...read them all. This is awful...not worth the paper it is written on. Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book. There really isn't a plot or story line...there is nothing!!! No doubt about it, someone else wrote it. Sorry for the son, he just isn't able to carry on the grand tradition. Major dissapointment!"
1,The worst of W.E.B. Griffin,"I was totally disappointed with this book. 300+ pages of nothing. I had read all of the Griffin war series and enjoyed them but this book had no real plot, virtually no action, and no real end to the story. If you like reading about coffee being served, drinks being poured, or hotel room decorations, you may like this book. What a waste of time and money."
5,a welcome return,"When my father-in-law died I inherited a lot of his books. As I began to read the folks who were his favorites W. E. B. Griffin really stood out. The first books I read were the Men At War Series, and I really found myself wanting more. The Saboteurs is an excellent return to those characters.It picks up at the completion of the previous series mission to bring out a nuclear scientist and sets the stage for a new series. Canidy prepares for an operation in Sicily and Fulmar chases a group of German saboteurs in the states. Much of the story revolves around the characters Fulmar is chasing, and the underworld figures Canidy is dealing with, The plot moves well, and leaves the reader wanting more. Its definately a ""You gotta sit down and read this one"" novel.This is a great read for a guy when he goes to the beach and wants to distance himself from his wife/significant other's copy of Under the Tuscan Sun. A really good read, highly recommend."
3,Big disappointment,"As most of the other reviewers here, I have read, re-read, and in some cases, re-read several more times all of WEB's military series (my favorite being the Marines). This book was a big - and I mean BIG - disappointment. I don't think WEB actually wrote anything in this book. None of his style is there. As for the story lines, I felt cheated by all of them. If this book was written by IV, then he needs to start his own series, and let WEB continue writing - alone - books in his series. If there is another in the ""Presidential Agent"" series, I hope IV stays out of it. Otherwise, it will be another series that comes to a very disappointing end.By the way, I paid $9.99 for this book new ... I could have spent that on beer and re-read some of WEB's older books and had a heck of a lot more fun! And when did paperbacks get to be so darned expensive?"
3,Lacking,Griffins' latest book lacked the excitement he generated in previous novels. Style is the same but the story isn't.
1,It's time to go to the bathroom again,"A very disappointing book. After reading so many good books by Griffin in this series, this is a sorry excuse. There is no consistant plot line and after setting up the adventure in Sicily for the entie book it takes less than 10 pages to occur. There is never any account on how the hero gets his man. I cannot believe that the state of ones bladder could so dominate the thinking of one individual. He should try Vesicare."
2,Reread and Not as Good as I Remember,"I hadn't read this in about 20 years but decided to try it again. I really do like many of Bradley's Darkover books, especially the Renunciate books. However, The Spell Sword, one of her earlier works, has little depth to its characters and is not as well written as her later books. As another reviewer said, The Forbidden Tower, which I really like, has these same characters. The Forbidden Tower was published 3 years later and Bradley had improved her character and plot development skills most satisfactorily by then. The Spell Sword left me feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with the weak characters presented in the book. What little informationthe Spell Sword has can be found in later, much more well-written books.Its most interesting to read the Darkover books in chronological order (as listed at various websites), but you can skip this book and go directly to The Forbidden Tower and you would not have missed anything."
4,jacket review,"from the back cover of the September 1974 Daw paperback editionAlthough Darkover was a world inhabited by humans as well as semi-humans, it was primarily forbidden ground to the Terran traders. Most of the planet's wild terrain was unexplored...and many of its peoples seclusive and secretive.But for Andrew Garr there was an attraction he could not evade. Darkover drew him, Darkover haunted him-and when his mapping plane crashed in unknown heights, Darkover prepared to destroy him.Until the planet's magic asserted itself-and his destiny began to unfold along lines predicted only by phantoms and wonder workers of the kind Terran science could never acknowledge."
4,Beautiful watch,"This womens' Skagen watch is a beauty. The photos do not do it justice. It's elegant enough for evening and but not too blingy to wear everyday. The number are clear and the mesh band and slim lines make it comfortable.The clasp is a little tricky, but with a little bit of fiddling, I was able to adjust the circumference of the band for a comfortable fit.It's a keeper."
4,gorgeous watch for mom!,"this watch is gorgeous. my mom has been looking at it for years and finally told me she wanted it but didn't want to spend the money on it, so I bought it for her for christmas and she loved it! the only issue that I have with it is that to adjust the wristband, you have to move this little pin which is kind of difficult and then put it back before you can close the clasp. It felt like it was going to break when we were pushing it back down, but maybe we just didn't do it right. The face is the best part of this watch, along with the rose colored gold band. Enjoy!"
4,A Great book for early readers,I am nine and when I first read this book I liked a lot. It is the perfect book for early readers. I being a fan of Thomas am very fond of it.The book is about when Sir Topham Hatt asks Diesel to help Thomas. Then Diesel gets into trouble. In the end it shows how Diesel really wasn't bad when he helped Thomas out of the mud.
5,Beautiful!,"I found this little book at a thrift store, and had no idea what a gem it really was. It is filled with beautiful pictures and Biblical wisdom for the homemaker.Even my children love flipping through and reading the verses and looking at the pictures.I encourage you to click on through to Amazon and scroll through the gorgeous pictures!"
1,I was deeply disappointed in the quality of this book.,As an avid Science Fiction reader I was surprised in the quality of White Light after some of the reviews I read. The characters were never developed. The story itself was extremely disjointed. It seemed that that the authors had creative ideas and tried to bring them together but cared nothing about the fact that it became absurd. One final observation was about the excessive sex involved. At first you could see the connection and it did help in understanding the characters. Later it became obviously overdone and borderline comical. I have never disliked a book more.
1,Shallow and One Dimensional,"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in a while. I kept reading, hoping it would redeem itself, but instead it only got worse. The misogynistic Wolf, the main character, never grows past his obsession with women's genitalia. The women have no depth and remain objectified. The plot, if one can call it that, becomes horribly improbable and stereotypical at the same time - star gates which magically transport, good aliens who can telepathically speak to us, bad aliens trying to wipe out humanity, etc. ..."
1,These authors can do MUCH better!,"I have read s-f for many years (since Heinlein's heyday in the 50's), and in general I am rather accepting of not-so-great novels. I have read and greatly enjoyed these authors' previous work (Alpha Centauri). White Light is the worst SF story I have read in a long time. The ""space exploration"" part is lame and seems quite unsophisticated or convincing, and the same goes for the ""cosmology"" part. As previous reviewers have noted, the characters were not likeable nor even very interesting. Regarding the sex, that was about the only part I sort of liked, but I wasn't looking for an erotic novel. If someone gives you this book and you have nothing else to do, maybe it is worth reading. Otherwise, forget it!"
3,Too Much Sex and an Awful Ending,"In my opinion this novel contained too much sex. I understand that this is part of the human nature, however, there should be a limit. I also didn't like the ending where everyone went off into their own utopia and as usual, everyone lives happily ever after... BORING!"
2,Don't let the cover fool you.,"This story is bascially the worst of every soap opera plot combined with 2001. The use of profainity is unnecessary. And the she slept with him/he slept with her subplots steal every potential storyline in the book, making a terrible novel. The only good thing about the book is the excellent cover. That is the only reason this got 2 stars instead of one. Read the Odyssey books by Arthur C. Clarke instead."
2,Rohan,"This product will not work if you've use armorall to protect your trims in the past. I've done all the instruction told me and it didn't work, that's when I learned about once you use armorall, the result will not be as expected. Purchase with caution."
3,Decent Dye...,"Doesn't work as well as i would have hoped. You really need the surface before to be black as well. I ended up buying a plastic krylon spray paint, masking the entire car, and doing all my trim with the paint instead.The paint provides a much darker, much more professional look (that will NEVER fade). I did however use this on my tires\window gaskets and weather stripping with some success.Bottom line, if you want to re-do your trim, do it properly, rather than spending the cash on a product that lets you cut corners."
3,The not-so-Complete JT,"I was disappointed. More at what was not in the book than what was in it. This book only covers a few of his many albums. I have no complaints about the music that is in there but I had higher expectations when it said JT complete. I missed the ""Vol. 1"" hidden down by the ISBN #. Which is my own fault. This is Not James Taylor Complete. This is James Taylor Vol. #1!"
3,"Ok, but missing a lot.","This has the early works, but has a lot of songs I never heard of. It is missing a lot of what I was looking for."
2,Disappointing,"To say that this book was disappointing would be an understatement. The only story that was the slightest bit interesting was 'The Treasure Hunt' by Mary Balogh. It is about a young woman, Lady Constance Manning, who realizes too late that she has engaged herself to the younger brother when she is actually in love with the older one. Even that story was somewhat unsatisfying as, in the end, we are left wondering if the younger brother sacrifices his own love so that Connie may be happy or if he is also happy to break the engagement. However, the story itself is very sensitive and touching in the usual Balogh style. I hope she writes a sequel for the younger brother, Sidney. But the other stories are so boring that it is a chore to turn the pages. My recommendation: wait until all short stories by Mary Balogh get published in one volume."
3,Color is not the same as pictured......,"I only, only wish the color was as bright a red as shown in the pics. It does not matter where you see it advertised, it is the same beautiful presentation a red as you can imagine. But when you actually get it, it is a drab red and not quite as cheerful looking as it looks on site. Also, it is NOT white, but more like a cream. I guess I got the right canisters!!!! I am really not pleased at all with the colors, but I guess I will live with it!!! Sooo disappoointed!!!!"
5,Funky Melodic Grooves,"Everyone likes feel good music - This album is for everyone! I've had the ibizian Salinas Sessions album since last year and it features this guy on it too. After surfing the net I discovered his first album was out. It's one of those albums that lifts your spirits with catchy and funky melodic tunes, inspiring lyrics, excellent vocals and pro musicians at work. It's got everything from warm chillout grooves to excellent upbeat funk and house. It doesn't take a second time round to warm to - you'll love it the moment you hit play. An excellent album for listening to while chilling in the sun or getting ready to go out and party. Super funky album - refreshingly new style - you won't be disappointed."
2,This Book was in poor condition,"Very disappointed with the condition of this book. I chose this one because it said GOOD condition. I wanted it for my son to follow along with in school and make his own notes. The cover was beat up, the pages were ragged and just about every page had notes and marks on it. The seller contacted me via email and discussed a possible return or replacement, and I never heard from them again. Very disappointed."
3,Great.,Great book for children. It is really nice story for kids between the age of 10 and 15 to enjoy it
5,AMAZING,This book was so good. This is the book I chose to do for my book report in fifth grade. Thank you for writing this... it is my most favorite book. I savored every chapter of this book just like it was one of the memories.
5,The Giver,"This book is incredible! I enjoyed every minute reading it. Some people say that the ending is unclear, but I loved the ending. It lets people make up their own ending. For example: some people think Jonas dies in the end, while others think he really finds Elsewhere and continues his live there. I think people could start reading the book in 6th grade, so that there are a lot of different analysis and not just those of older people who maybe think a bit more."
3,The Giver,"This book was way to slow. But otherwise in some parts intresting and exciting, but in other parts very confusing. I recommend this book to people who have alot of time, and that like boring books. Thisp book also just left you hanging at the end, but in the middle of the book it was kind of exciting and adventurues. However you have to piece this book together very well if you want to truly understand it. But I just reccomend this book to adults, its not bad or anything, its just not something a kid would want to read. My likes of this book was there were some intressting parts in the middle of the book only. My dislikes were the boring part that weren't exciting at all like at the begening and the ending."
5,Even my mom liked it,"I read this book when I was in fourth grade and I thought it was really great. I read it over and over- about 5 times in all -and every time I found something I hadn't paid close attention to before. Later, my mom read the book to see why I liked it so much and she read it twice! It's a great book for any age."
4,The Giver,This book was amazing! I enjoyed every bit of it. The book has great detail to it. It is one of my favorite books this year so far. In the end the story finally clicks and its amazing to see what the author came up with. Defiantly one of the best books I've ever read.
4,A must-read book!,"Have you ever wondered what the word ""utopia"" means? This book's about a utopia gone wrong. If you like those kinds of books, you will love this book because this is the kind of book that's for you. In this story you will find Jonas, a boy who lives in a place where everything seems right when it's really wrong. He discovers this after receiving a gift of memory of the past and present. Jonas fights to make his world right. We recommend this book to all. --Sterling Bradbury, Jesse Pho, Kelsey Jarrett and Heather Murrah in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"
5,The Giver,"This fantastic book The Giver is about Jonas who is 11 years old. His community is all the same. They all have been named not by their parents but by the Elders. Their jobs, kid's families, and even their spouses are chosen for them. They live in a world with no colour, or music. When you become a 12 you get an assignment. Jonas was assigned a special job, The Receiver of Memory. Some memories he receives are scary, frightening and painful, but some are rather enjoyable.This book caught my attention because the memories got more and more intense; it was also a bit shocking. I couldn't stop reading it; it was the best book I have read because it made me think about things in a different way. No wonder it won the John Newbery Medal!By: J.A.C 7R"
3,GOOD BOOK,The book after the first 2 chapters was pretty boring and I wanted to stop. But I kept reading and I couldn't put it down!This book had not too many exciting parts but interesting ones. Who would theink that everyone being the same would be interesting? The part that I thought the author should change is rhe unpredicable ending where it keeps you thinking that there should be more to The Giver.
4,The Giver,"A twelve year old boy named Jonas has the perfect life. He is never hungry, never has to deal with war, and he never has any reason to believe that something is wrong with his life and the society that he lives in. When Jonas is picked to be the Receiver of Memories, he embarks on a dangerous and exciting journey. Jonas begins to learn the truth about his society, and what is kept hidden from public view. He realizes the hypocrisy that he has to deal with everyday, and he learns that maybe the world isn't so perfect anymore. What will Jonas do with his new knowledge?I thought The Giver was a great book. It is the only book of its kind to portray a perfect Utopian society realistically. Lois Lowry uses her colorful writing skills to create life-like characters that everyone can relate to and an exciting plot with surprises at every turn. I would recommend this book as a good read for anyone who is into science fiction with a twist."
3,The Giver Review,The Giver is a very interesting book. It tells about an imaginary world that seems so perfect. The further you read into the book the more you begin to relize that the world can and never will be perfect. It is a great book and it makes the younger and older readers think. My only problem with this book is the ending. It would have been better if she would have gone into more depth on what happened to the main character. I wouldn't won't to ruin the book for so I you so i won't say much more. If you want a book of fantasy this is the perfect book of the almost perfect world. I would recomend this book to just about anyone.
3,Was it good or bad??,"The Giver was an ok book. Althogh it was not the type of book I usally read it was good to get a change. Most people in our class thought it was a bad book or didnt even read it. Me, I thought the book was pretty good. There were some parts of the book that I just did not like alltoghter like going into sameness or ""releasing""(better know as killing) the twin and old people. Yet there were some things in the book I think our goverment should look at. Such as no more world hunger and no more war. That would be awesome! Weel although I liked the book I can only give it 3 stars but I would recommend it to anyone who wants something diffrent."
4,The Giver,"I thought this book was awesome. I really liked it. My favorite part was when Jonas received the memory of love. I also liked the way the aurthor used forshadowing in this novel. So that every part of the story had a reason for being there. In my own opinion the saddest part in the story was the releasing of the twin and Jonas saw the real meaning of being released. The reason I thought that this book desearved 4 stars was beacause when Jonas fled to elsewhere they didn't tell us what happened when he got there. But if they had the the story would have gone on forever. I beleive that the aurthor of this book has a great talent be cause when I read this book I realized that life is so much more. If we didn't have pain then we wouldn't have strength, and even though love may hurt sometimes it is great to have loved someone at all. So thank you Lois Lowry for this wonderful novel."
2,CD was taped over,Disappointing that the CD was obviously overwritten with the story. It was possible to hear some of the songs in the background. All the song titles are still showing - no chapters or book references. I was disappointed and feel a little cheated since it was supposed to be a brand new copy.
5,The Giver,I loved this book but the ending I can't decide if I like it or not. I would highly recommended to read this book.
5,The giver,Good book. It makes you think of the future of sameness... I'll be buying gathering blue next. Can't wait!!!Awesome
4,Lauren's review,"I thought that The Giver was an excellent book. I loved the way that Lois Lowry depicted a world without memories of legends. It was an original plot, and I think it would be scary if such a thing really did happen, that the entire world lost touch with its roots, save for one person burdened with having to keep the memories. This one person, the Receiver, had to then call upon the memories to help save the community in the book. I know that if something like that ever did happen, Franklin MA. and Franklin High School, not to mention the rest of the world, would be devoid of all emotion. This would be devastating because we need emotions to be human."
5,Great Story,"I've loved this book since middle school and have been desperate for a good read lately. I've read this book several times and have called this my favorite book for the better part of two decades, but have never owned it. It was just time. My only complaint is that it's too short! I wish this book would just go on and on. I realize it's for a younger audience and probably appreciated it length when I was a less experienced reader. I'm glad to own it now so I can read it to my heart's content."
5,Outstanding novel,This book brings out the emotion in you. I would recommend this book to anybody over the age of 10.
5,The Giver,Miss lorey makes you feel like you are part of her colorless world. The Giver makes you want to relate back to your own life. The way there are so many rules it makes think of them being controled by that speaker. This book was just wonderful. It made you want to be with Jonas and his friends. It was very intrigueing.
3,Intriguing yet not completely satisfying.,"This is probably the most interesting book that I have ever read. Lois Lowry's story of the Community that is devoid of feeling and color takes you on a deep journey, but that journey grinds to an unsatisfying halt. Lowry claims that she wrote the ending of the Giver to be so vague because the book is so many different things to so many different people and that everyone has a different idea of how it should end. To me though, it just feels like she rushed to create the ending and is cheating us by not even offering a sequel. This novel had great potential, but the ending ruined it. A good author starts strong and ends strong and gives the reader something to take with them in the last few moments. Lois Lowry does neither of these things and that is the big disappointment."
4,The Giver,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a book of difference not sameness. The young reader will be intrigued by the many differences of this book. This book explores love, friendship, and differences, most things that teens experience in their every day life. This book was well written and was liked because of the... and wierd feeling of Jonas' world. This book recieves a 4 out of 5 stars. A very fine and well written book."
3,The Giver,When I read The Giver I was a little confused in the begining. This book is about a young boy who is given the chance to take over a very important role in his community. He learns a lot from his experience and decides to make a very important decision. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or fictional type of stories. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I would a more kind of sci-fi horror type of book. I do like fiction but not this kind of fiction. To me this kind of fiction is unrealistic and kind of immature. Some parts of this book did suprise me and the book does kind of keep you on your feet wondering what is going to happen next but I do have to say that this was not a favorite of mine but might be for someone else.
4,The Giver,"in a flawless community of people run by that of elders and strict ruling,there is a december serimony in which all children at the age of 11 must go through. this cerimony determines this persons new life, assigning them there life job and there place in the community. one boy, jonas, is forgotten in this serimony and this creates attention through the crowd. afterword he is advised that he has actually been chosen as the reciever of memories and must be the apprentice an elderly man,the giver, who in his mind contains the memories of the time before this flawlessness. as reciever, jonas must receive these memories through a procces in which he must come back to see this man everyday and feel and live the memories. through this procces jonas feels the most joyous parts of these memories, and also the harshest most painfull parts of these memories."
3,Mr. Matta's Student Review,This book was ok. The ending was rather lackluster and left many questions unanswered. The overall book was interesting and makes you think about how life could be in a Utopian society. Many problems of the world are resolved in this book but the people are practically brainwashed. This book would be a good intro into other Utopian books. It's not my favorite book but it's good.
4,The Ending,I dislike the ending of the book. I would have liked to seen what happens next and I think a sequal should be made showing what happens to Jonas's Community and what also happens to Jonas and Gabriel.
4,The Giver: a new classic,"I really enjoyed reading The Giver. I thought that there were new twists to the story with every chapter. As Jonas goes through his training and journey to new discoveries we learn as he learns, about the community and beyond. I thought that every detail of the community life and the citizens was well thought out. I liked the fact that the society had a Utopian shell and corrupt internal workings. It showed that people go throw great lengths to take away all of the hurt and pain but it also takes away so many of the joys of life that can become complicated. I liked the deeper meaning and the overall picture that the story lays out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
5,Appreciate One Another...,"Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy lives in a community where everything is pretty much kept the same. However, once he turns twelve, along with everyone else in his age group receives a job assignment that fits their personality. He is given one of the most important and respected jobs of all-the Receiver. As the Receiver, he learns what life was like before the sameness and learns to love that more than the life he knows.I have read this book for the second time and I have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It really makes a person appreciate the little differences in everyone and hope that even if peace can be achieved through sameness, we still should love one another for who we are and not for who we aren't. We should appreciate differences and learn to be much more open-minded."
4,Good book and kept you interested,"This book was great! It really kept you interested. We never got bored. The ending though, was kinda confusing. It didn't tell you what happened after he went down the hill. Did he die or did he live? Did he find the Elsewhere he was looking for? The ending was to undiscribed. The rest of the book was great however! Mrs. Lowry, thank you for writing this book. You made us think!"
4,Some interesting stuff...,"I read this book a few years ago, and have just recently read Fahrenheit 451, a very similar book. Both are about colorless, utopian societies, and in both the hero chooses to go against this society. Thinking is no longer present in either of these simplified worlds - who needs choice, and the problems that go with it? I enjoyed both books thoroughly, and would recommend this book to people of all ages.I would also like to note that the sales rank of this book is 451."
4,Unforgetable,"I think the Giver is an interesting book that was well described by Lois Lowry. The characters were my favorite part, due to the well description. Lois brought up many different issues in the book, such as a world with no religion, abortion, and sameness. His world has no color, and that makes you thankful for what you have. I disliked the ending, I did not like how it made me pick my own ending. I like endings told to me, where you actually know the ending and there is no confusion on what the story is suppose to mean. Overall, it is a good novel. I would reccomend this to many people."
3,High imagination,"The book "" The Giver "" written by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community where everything is controlled by the government. He's chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. He starts to have doubts about the system and finally tries to escape.It's a very imaginative book but sometimes it looses the connection to reality. It is a bit predictable, because you can imagine what the end will be like when you've read the first chapters."
4,The Results of a Government That Abused Its Power,"While I know that many elements of this story would be impossible to duplicate in real life, it does make one think about what life could be like if the government overstepped its boundaries.It was a very good story and I had no trouble staying interested. It's just leaving me more thoughtful and melancholy than I thought it would. The thought of the government controlling lives to that extreme is pretty disturbing."
3,"A good place to start, but otherwise hackneyed","I had a class on dystopian fiction in college with one of my favorite professors, so between that and the fact that this is, essentially, a book for young adults, perhaps I am jaded. I mean, I see why so many people like it so much, but after readingBrave New World,Nineteen Eighty-Four,1985and great heaping mounds of sci-fi, I find myself thinking ""meh."" I had all the big twists figured out by about page 60, and the biggest well before that.So, bottom line: if you're just getting started in the genre, this is a great place for it. If you've been in for a while, I think you can skip it, unless you have an obsession for thoroughness or just want to be able to participate in conversations about this book knowledgeably."
3,"Good Body, Bad Ending","The Giver by Lois Lowry was a really good book that I feel let me down at the ending. The story's main character is an 11 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community that is assigned wives ,children, homes, and jobs. As Jonas turns 12, he recieves a job different from all the others. The Reciever of Memory. Throughout the story you will learn how Jonas learns about the pain, suffering, and happiness in the past that no longer exists in his community.I really enjoyed this book up until the ending. I liked the first person point of view that was portrayed. Lois Lowry did a good job creating a community like Jonas'. I gave The Giver 3 stars because it was a good book, but i felt like the author just wanted a way to end the book fast.Although I gave this book 3 stars, I recommend this book to people of all ages."
5,What a wonderful book!,"I sat down on a long car ride deciding to read this book rather than be bored (which is what I expected to become reading the book or not). But I was NOT bored. The book was so astounding. It makes you feel sad to think of such a community ever existing. And even the people themselves being so brain-washed and ignorant to know how their ""perfect life"" is so controlled is a scary thought. I can read this book again and again. I definitely recommend The Giver to any reader, no matter what age."
5,Cool Book,"I loved The Giver! I recommended it to all my friends! If you like to read, try this book."
4,I think the book was ok,"I think the book was ok, it was good through the whole book untill it got to the end. the last chapter was dumb, I didnt like how it ended but my favorit chapter was chapter 19. I liked how he talked about the release and how Jonas got to watch it, and see how powerful. when I started reading it I thought it was a really good book then it started geting to the end and I didnt like it as much."
4,I think it was a harsh look at the future.,The Giver was a pretty good look at what our future could look like. It would be an unfair life to live without color or feelngs.The book really discribed how you it not be very fun to see with no color or feelings. I think that Lois Lowery could have made the ending way better i was disapointed in the ending and how she left us out to hang. But this book opened my eyes to what we could grow up living like in the future. Maybe we already are.
5,"A different book, one for the open-minded reader.","I enjoyed the Giver and all the memories he had to share with Jonas. It made me realize the things that I take for granted everyday such as seeing colors, feeling love, and making my own choices. Jonas had an important choice to make in the story and I wonder if I would have made the same decision in his situation. I never did figure out the end of the story......."
5,The Giver by Lois Lowry: Not Just a Childs Book,"Most people think that young adult books can not be as good as adult books. I used to agree, but now I strongly disagree. The Giver is my favorite book ever. It is wonderful reading for any age, boys or girls, men or women. In this novel, Lois Lowry really reminds us not to take the little things for granted; the weather, colors, hills. Who knows how long they'll be around? I highly reccomend this book to anyone who loves to read."
3,This was a fairly good book.,"The Giver was, in my opinion, a fairly good book. The storyline was good and Lois Lowry did a very good jod of portraying Jonas's fellings throught the book. The only thing I didn't understand was the ending. Overall though this was a good book."
5,Enjoying and Suspenseful,"A real interesting and suspensful ride into your imagination. A real enjoyable book for pre-teens and teens. A well wrighten book. It sure deserves the John*Newberry*Medal. The bigging is a little on the boring side, but it starts to get better and better during the book. Once u get a hold of the book u won't wan't to put it down for anything. that's why I give it 5 stars. It's what it deserves. 5 stars for the great story called The Giver."
5,One of the most thought provoking book's I've ever read.,"I have just reread this book with my daughter and I still can't believe how amazing it is. The Giver always reminds me of the John Lennon song ""Imagine"". It is an entire book written about what it is like to live in a utopian society. On the outside it is perfect but this book is about the dark reality of perfection. I could not put it down."
4,I read the book The Giver dy Lowis Lowey,"This story takes place in a community in the future. the peope in the community get their life assignement at the age of 12. None of the people in the community can see in color or have any memories of the past. Jonas, the main charterin the book is choosen to be the Reciver of memories.This jod was considered to be a job of honer. Once Jonas recives different memories he feels out of place."
3,"A powerful, emotional story- wishing for more","An interesting read- very thought provoking. A friend recommended it, and though I enjoyed it overall, it left me wanting more. It would have been better if the characters had been developed more and if there was a stronger conclusion to the story- it flet like we were just left hanging at the end. The book presents an interesting future and even has some spiritual elements to it. It was pretty engaging, perhaps just not long enough to develop a fully satisfactory story for me."
5,This was the BEST book!,"I absolutely LOVED this book! I'd give it more stars if I could! The ending is totally unique, but it's just perfect. I wouldn't change a word of it. A different ending would destroy the book."
4,Engaging Story - Ending Was Missing,"The Good:The story was compelling and the author was able to draw you into the characters. You really began to care about the few ""real"" people in the story. The people who know ""anything"" come alive and you feel the depth of the truly unique and horrible situation they are in.I applaud the perspective on the intrinsic value of human life. The horror felt by the taking of innocent life for the convenience of the community is a breath of fresh air in our society.I love the narration. I listen to quite a few books and quite a few narrators and Ron Rifkin did a first rate job here.The Bad:It seems that the most difficult part of a story to write is the ending. In this case the author simply chose not to write an ending, leaving the decision of what actually happened up to the reader. While on the surface this sounds like a clever intellectually compelling device in practice it just seems like a copout.The Giver"
3,"two stars for content, 5 stars for narration.","Rifkin does an excellent job as the narrator of this book. his vocal tone and reading style match the story very well. the story itself has various logical problems that i found distracting. i cannot add much to what has already be written by over 3000 reviews. The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative.i would suggest looking at the Dr van der Linden's review (he rates the book 1 star) as well as the 5 star reviews, as he makes some valid points about the story and suggests other better constructed stories on the similar dystopic themesThe Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks),Between Planets,Citizen of the Galaxy."
2,"Interesting subjects raised, but the story has logic problems.","The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative.Better constructed stories on similar dystopic themes areThe Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks),Between Planets,Citizen of the Galaxy."
3,The Giver,The Giver was a ok book. But there was some funny part in the book. but i like it a little bit of this book. And kids you should read this book.Taylor C
3,the giver,"It was ok, not that great abit to long and boring. I enjoyed some of the suspense,and it was a bit to long and some of it was to much."
2,It was okay,I have just read this book (...). This book was interesting and at some parts it left you wanting to read more and more. But at the begining of this book the author seemed to not have any idea of what she was writing. The begining and the end i personaly thought were terrible. Not so much as the end but the last chapter. The parts that kept me reading were good but still the author might have been able to put more thought into what she was writing. The author had many things that did not fit and things that were badly placed because of the words that she had said before.
2,"Well written, but...","This book was a well written book, I think, but I did not enjoy reading it. It did not hold my attention very much and I found that the storyline changed a lot. I would not recommend this for anyone under 14."
3,The Giver,"The Giver is an okay book, it wasn't something that I would read again, it was kind of like a one-time read. It had good parts but I liked some of Louis Lowry's other books better, the ending isn't great but if you have an ""open mind"" it should make sense. It's a good book except the reading level was a little low and the ending wasnt very good, but besides that it was okay."
1,The Giver Review,"This was not good literature based on three main reasons. I wasn't very interested while reading this book because it was first upsetting, secondly the ending was not what I expected, and finally it is disgusting. It was upsetting because they had no feelings for little children. If you were a twin they would weigh you and if you weighed less you would be released. Also, the ending wasn't good at all because it just ends, when you want to know more. Some of the memories the Giver transferred were disgusting. For example, when Jonas was sledding and hit a tree and he saw his own flesh and was bleeding. A quote to support my answer is then ending of the book, "" Behind him, across a vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo."" The way the book ended was confusing because it seemed that there should be more too it, but there wasn't. As you can see, this text is not good literature."
1,The Giver,"A reader from Seaford: The Giver is a book that makes you appreciate the little things that you have in life. If you like a lot of cliff hangers, and think Lois Lowry is a great author the The Giver is a book for you. Lois Lowry described this book in good detail, but the end was a little disappointing. In my opinion Lois Lowry has written fantastic books, and each book always has a meaning. The Giver was an okay book."
1,The Giver,"The Giver, December 16, 2004A Kid's ReviewThe giver was about a boy named Jonas. Jonas has a sister and a mom and dad. Jonas turns twelve and gets assigned a job. Jonas's job is The Receiver Of Memories. That means Jonas takes on memories. After his training he will be The Giver. The Giver talks about the last receiver of memories and how she asked to be released. So The Giver told Jonas after your training I will be released. So when he was done with his training he heard that Gabe his little friend that was staying with his family was going to be released. Jonas took Gabe and ran away.This book was hard for me to get into. It really didn't have a lot of action and was mostly boring in my opinion. That is why I rated it a one star."
2,The Giver,"Although given a newberry award, The Giver is both boring and confusing. It's too confusing and deep for children. I didn't understand this book and I don't think it made a lot of sense."
4,da giver review,"I think the giver is a great book for any person over the age of 11.It is most interesting for the 6th and 7th grade.It involves confusing literature,tough vocabulary and a perfect world. This is about a boy named Jonas who is getting a little disgusted with the way these people live.So you should read this book and see if you have the same idea as they do for a perfect world.I think your ideas will differ from theirs!"
4,An inspiring book,"The Giver is an amazing book about a boy in a perfect world, who is selected for a special job, and he is a very important citizen now. Jonas now has much pressure and many hardships to overcome. What will happen in this story? Lois Lowry has created a differtent style book, and it is inspiring to myself and others. Read this great masterpiece that you will cherish, enjoy, and remember for a lifetime! I highly recommend this exquisite story."
5,The Giver,"Thrilling, truly breath taking. I like this book because when you start reading it you'll never guess the ending. Its about a boy who had a normal life in futuristic community, until he became the Reciever. He then learns to feel and see in a new light. I recommend this book for all ages. It will help children appreciate what they have."
2,The Giver,"I thought that the book was kind of weird. It was mostly about a perfect town but the did not really live the way people where made to live. Basicly they don't have feelings or know about anything from a normal town. The people do not know war, love, hunger, they also didn't know what dieing was, and no one new that released ment killing some one."
5,To critisize the critics,"This book is amazing. Anyone who has questions about it and the ending of it is lacking an imagination. The book ends obscurely so the reader can create one to their own delight. For the person asking about family units and such, they didn't read the whole book. This was clearly stated in the book that the family units could not name themselves because the community decided to create ""sameness."" Sameness also goes for the black and white images they all see. Anyone who can not understand this must not have read the whole book."
4,Insightful,"This beautifully written story kept me entranced and reading the book from cover to cover without a single stop, She has left medeep in thought and with a bitter sweet solace ."
3,"no couler,toys for each age,1boy1girl,had2boys.","The book was verry good, it was kind of hard to understand,because of the non coulers and ect."
3,leboG DOG,Ididn't really like The Giver becuase it didn't have a nice ending. I would have perfered it to be like Jonas and Gabriel reach Elsewhere and decide to go back and the comity of Elders lets Gabriel stayu and live with Jonas and his family and Gabriel grows up to be the receiver of memories and they all live happly ever after. Then I would rate this book beter. I also think that there should be a sequel becuase this is a book that could easly continue. I think that this book could be beter if tryed. leboGDOG
5,Really good book!!!,"The Giver is one of the best books I ever read. It's about Jonas, a boy who lives in a world without color or feelings. One day he gets his new job that he has to train for and it is Receiver of memories. Jonas has to receive all the memories of a past world with color, feelings, and love. All these memories start him thinking about how horrible his world really is. This book made me think of how lucky we are to have feelings."
3,boring and interesting,I think the book is very boring at the beginning. But fortunately the book becomes more and more interesting. It deals with a strange and exciting topic which you have to think about. I would recommend it to science fiction freaks who like the book 1984 by George Orwell. In order to get more out of the book you should discuss the topic with someone.
3,Why so Sad?,"This book is very well written, and another wonderful read from Louis Lowry, but in a so-called perfect community, why have babies dye? Also, this book end with two people ready to die? You end reaing it with a heavy heart."
5,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!,"My 5th grade teacher read this book to our class, I soon bought it. It's soo great! I think people should read some of it. I couldn't get my hand off of it!"
3,"A good book for children, but not a good read for an adult.","Lois Lowry's ""The Giver"" would be a good read for a child. But lacks the literary greatness that I've come to expect in books. In my opinion, this was just a wrip off of Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" produced in a manner that is more up to date and understandable. By now, we are aware of comformity, and with the Soviet scare now longer at our backs, maybe the subject is dead?"
2,pity the poor middle-schoolers,"The Giver is every adolescent's frustrated view of the world given a fictional future reality. Pills keep you from enjoying sex, your parents are obsessive-compulsively normal, and only one person in the whole city knows what's going on and how things got that way. One very special boy decides to break the chain. So far so good: we're talking Huck Finn in the 22nd century. Unfortunately, our hero's end is so open-ended, it begins to feel like the clones back in squaresville had it right all along. In my world, that makes The Giver a moral tale in support of oppressive conformity hiding in the sheep's clothing of an anti-social fable. Gross. Sometimes being coy is just wrong."
5,The Giver,"Everyone fantasizes about living in a perfect world. The Giver takes that idea and makes it seem real. The characters find that a perfect world may have its drawbacks. This book is a wonderful way to begin group discussion on the meaning of life, ethics, and responsibility in a classroom setting. I have enjoyed teaching this book as much as my students enjoyed reading it."
4,An intreging book from the community beyond!!!,"The Giver is just one of the many books written by Lois Lowery. The setting is in the future of a community that is very monotonuos. There are no momories of any generation but there own, only one person has all the momories of any time and place. The Giver is what he goes by and he has apprentice named Jonas who is the Reciever of memories. Jonas was chosen and honored to have been picked for the job. He took real pain and hunger for the first time. The community is uniform everything is a routine and has sameness. At the ending Jonas runs away taking someone special with him on the long journey. I will leave the ending for you to figure out!"
3,It was good book but lacked a good ending.,"The book the giver was written by Lois Lowery. This book is a great book for young adluts over 13. Any one younger than that age woulent uderstand the book. The main charecter of the book is a young boy named Jonas who lives in a community where everthing is perfect. All the decisions are made for all the people in the community. They have no color, no music, they cannot pick there own jobs, there lives are controled by a Comminty of Elders. Jonas is chosen to be a reciver of memorys, the only person that knows about how things like color look like . As he learns to feel emotions like love and feel pain he feels left out of the community. The rest of the book s abut his struggle to get away from the community. I think think book lacks a good eneding but the rest of the book has many twists and suprises."
3,"a story of a boy in his ""perfict"" community.","I read the book The Giver by Louis Loury. The book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a ""perfect"" comunity, so he thinks. Until he is chosen for the job of recever, the highest of honor's. There he learnes things that he never wanted to know and can never forget. I thought this book was well writen with good feeling and alliteration. Untill the ending that while being interesting to some, will be tediouse and annoying to others. I give this book three stars because it has a good beginning and middle but a ending that may leave some wanting more."
2,The Giver,"The beginning it is really boring. Once you pass like Chapter 6 or 7, that is when the climax gets very interesting."
1,boring and stupid,"Newberry Awards are most useful for telling a reader which books to avoid. This is an example of a 'book' that wins an award for appealing to literary intelligentsia rather than because it's a 'good read'. There's no sense of wonder, no sense of adventure, but everything is very *PC*.Go buy ""White Fang"" or ""The Yearling""Read something by Mercedes Lackey, R. A. Heinlein, H. Beam Piper or David Weber. But for goodness sake, please don't buy this book on the same principle of *not* feeding stray cats. It only encourages them to stick around and reproduce."
1,Terrifying for Children,Children are forced to read this book in 7th grade. At one point the book was banned in many schools and I can see why. Do you really want your children to read about babies being murdered by their own parents and tossed down a garbage chute? That's only one example of this warped tale. The book is so dark that I think it can disturb children and possibly adults as well. The points made in the book can be made without the intense darkness and fear pervading the story.I don't think any 7th grader is emotionally mature enough to read The Giver. When I was in middle school we read a short story by Ray Bradbury that made all of the same points (in a SHORT story no less)without the horror. A better writer does not need graphic and disturbing details to bring a child to think.
1,repulsive,When I was told about this book I was told good things but when I read it I was disgusted by the story. I just found it so terrible and wicked I stopped reading. Any one who thinks this is a good book for a child couldn't be more wrong.
2,The Giver--Ryan,"I don't recommend the book the Giver to most people. It has a poor mixture of mystery and drama. If you like action books ,this one's not for you. It has a dull plot because it takes place in an descrete area that is diconnected from society that we know and love. Everything is perfect, except for one thing. The freedom of choice we have does not exist in that world. The main character is a young boy by the name Jonas. He is chosen to take on a job that the community depends on. He has to recive many memories of the past in order to protect the future, yawn. if you were to like the book, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, this ones for you."
4,The Giver Book review,"The Giver was a fantastic novel but mysterious at the same time. If you like fanstasy, then you will love this book and you won't be able to put it down. It is extremely confusing in the first 3-4 chapters, but at one point it all start to come together. This wonderful book follows the adventures of Jonas in his strict community, while leading up to the ceremony that will change his life forever, by deciding his profession. Then, he meets The Giverwho trains him every day after school. He must report straight home every night after training and is strictly prohibited to any recreation time with his friends after that. He is not allowed to speak of his training, and he starts to fall apart emotionally. But then, him and The Giver come up with a daring plan. One wrong move and Jonas could be in great danger. There is no turning back now.By: Mackenzie F. 7R"
3,The Giver,"This book was about a 12 year old boy, named Jonas, who lived in a utopian community. Everything was decided for them. Their jobs, marriages, even children. These people didn't see colour, they didn't have real feelings about life. Every year when you turn 12 you would be assigned a role in the community. But this time Jonas was selected. He was to become the next Receiver of Memory. He would receive the memories of the past, which no one else would understand. These memories are painful and scary yet some are beautiful and mysterious. ALT 7R"
1,When simple is too simple,"This book has generally been described as a book about a utopia, while we ignore the pressing issue: this book is a dystopia. Much more that a miscategorization, this book is generally poorly written. With little to no figurative language, how can we expect our children to learn to write while reading just the basics of language. Metaphors and irony make political commentaries good.There are also logical errors in her book. It does not follow that death and leaving the bounds of the community would have the same consequence, yet in The Giver, they do. There are much better books that offer much the same message of The Giver while using better language and better logic like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Anthem, and 1984. If we are looking to educate on a dystopia, any of those books would provide much more substance."
1,Trash from the Left,"This book is widely used in English class by middle schools in Southwestern Pennsylvania.I have heard many complaints from parents about the violent subject matter contained in this story.After reading the book, I find that the most offensive incident was the murder of a newborn twin via lethal injection. As newborns have no visible veins, the infant was injected in the forehead.Now if you think that this is appropriate subject matter for your 7th and 8th grade children, buy it. If you choose not to buy it, please beware that they may still read it in school.As an adult and father of four, I'm left with the impression that an adolescent would be less likely to trust their parents after reading this book.Save you money and buy a classic."
1,Pretty boring and non exciting,"This boring novel is filled with sci-fi. Only few parts in the book are exciting. Even though strange, it has earned many awards. The author that wrote this book is very talented. It is filled with sadness. The best part in the book is when Jonas (main character) learns what the word released means. Released is when a person is killed that is not reacting good in the community that they live in. In his community there are no automobiles, alcohol, money and many other different things. Instead of driving cars they drive bicycles. There are also no jobs. Instead of money people get things free. Goods are supplied to all households. Over all I don't reccomend this book unless you are boring."
1,Yuck!?!,"I couldn't finish this book, but I got far enough through it to know that I didn't like it. It is sort of a gated community slash perfect world type setting, where nothing really interesting ever happens. Duh!!!Trevor"
3,Stupid yet good,"View one: This book was very freaky for one thing.People aren't supposed to remember things, as hinted in the book, but they remember one thing. This book is stupid. 1 star View two: The Giver was definately the most touching and dramatic book I have read this year.I will remember it for a long time and will always wonder what happened after the ending when Jonas finally heard music. The author showed much creativity and character in this excellent book. 5 star"
3,It was weird and changed our perspective of things.,"Jonas was the main character! In this book we learned that its not always the best to let other people pick things out for you. Everyone was the same, no one could really make fun of others. The Giver was a really giving was a really giving man. What he gives to Jonas you will have to read the book, to find out."
3,Perpective,"""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry is an insightful novel that gives us the perspective--what would happen if there were no feelings? What if there was no pain? What if there was no happiness or passion? The world would live in a utopia, but would it really be worth it? The novel follows a boy named Jonas who discovers feelings, but everyone around him remains neutral. He wants to show them pain, happiness, warfare, fear, passion. But, such things could ruin the utopia. The novel really gives you a grateful feeling that you can experience feelings."
4,The Receiver,"""The Giver"" was a fabulous book that brought to light how important having memories, feelings, and individuality is. Once the truth is learned about the community, the emotions and desperation shown for change is remarkable. The storyline is unique and unforgettable. Although the detail in some parts could be improved upon, over all it was a really great story. (N.M.)"
4,A book that made me go hmmmmm..,For me; the Giver was truly a thought provoking experience. It made me take another look at how we live our lives and would sameness be bearable if one never knew any other way. Things that make u go hmmmmm
5,A Book That Really Make You Fell Like Youre In Another Word,This is the most heartbreakinbg and soul searching book I have ever read.While reading this book you have to think what would you do in this situation. Would you have the courage and strength to endure what Jonas went through. I would have to admit that I don't think I would be that strong in a world like that. This book really moved me and caused me to be thankful for the simple little things that we have in life(like color) and not to take anything for granted.
5,THE best book ever!!!!!,"I loved this book!!!! I read it last year when I was twelve, and it automaticly became one of my favorite books. It's great! I recomend it to anyone because it's sooo interesting. At the begining, it was really weird. At the end it was still weird, but it's a really cool book, like I said."
4,The Giver,"Have you seen in black and white? Probably not, Jonas is a regular boy who lives in some kind of a world where everything is same. Everybody doesn't have any memories.Such as pains, sadness, love... So Jonas and the `Giver' tries to give his community back their memories by leaving the community. So the giver and Jonas make some plans to leave the community. But giver wouldn't leave with Jonas. Why the giver doesn't wants to leave? Will Jonas run away by himself? Find out by reading this book!"
4,This is a GREAT book,"This book is about a teenage kid living in the far future in a manufactured ""community"". Everybody's day is entirely planned out. The kid is chosen to be the next ""receiver of memories"", which is the person who holds all the memories of the past. I highly recomend this book"
3,"The book was good, but very hard to get into and understand.","The beginning was hard to get into. It was hard to undertand why everything that happened in the community had to happen as a group; for instance, the way they did their age groups. Every age group that was in the communtiy had their birthday on one specific day and they called it a ceremony. It was also hard to undertsand why on every birthday they had each child received a specific thing; for examlpe, each eight year old got a button up-the-front jacket to symbolize their growing up. The bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually out into the community, away from the protective family unit."
2,Just ok,"This book, The Giver, is written by the well known author Lois Lowry. She is a very talented author and has won many awards for this book. This book takes place in a ""perfect"" community. It is run by commity of elders. They make all the decisions for the community because they think that they will make the wrong decisions in life. When you become a nine, which is your age, you receive a bike. When you becaome a twelve you will receive an assignment which is just like yoiur job. Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories which is a very honorable job. The giver must give the receiver the memories. Jonas gets all the feelings that he has never felt before. He desperately wants to see the real world. Overall this book was not to good. It was very hard to keep reading it."
2,Bad end,The begining of this book was good. It is a good idea for a book but it seems incompleat. I had to read this book in 6th grade 2 years later i bought it so i could see why i hated it. It's because at the end he is just at the top of the hill looking down. It needs to tell what hapens next. Some books that i read are like that except the endings are writen so that you can imagin what happens. The Giver just stops. I think the book should be rewritten with a better end. Maybe I will write a sequal.
2,"Why this book made the shelves, I don't know!","I don't recommend this book because it was boring! I thought it made no sense. It was very weird that his world had no color, and so many rules! In the book I felt that it put down pregnant woman. It had no choice to it, meaning that the people of this community had no say in who they were going to marry, their jobs and they didn't even have their own children! BUT alot of people also enjoyed the book, but I don't recommend it."
3,A pretty good book,This was a pretty good book but it is very simular to brave new world and i think that book was a lot better. But i think this book is good for kids who would not be able to hadle that kind of stuff. i noticed a lot of people didn't like the ending but i thought it was good because you can decide for your self what happened.
3,the giver,"The book The Giver is written by Lois Lowry. There are several characters in the book. Jonas is the main character. Lilly is his little sister. The Giveris someone very special. Jonas eventually meets someonewho will change his life. It all takes place in ""The Community"" in the future world of the book. The problem is that Jonas really does'nt like the community. If you read the book you can decide if it is a utopia(perfect world) or a dystopia(nightmare world). I think it is both. But I think the book is a good book. Maybe other people would enjoy it too."
4,the Giver,Can you imagine living in a town were everything is perfect? well if you dont like that try reading a book called The Giver. It is wrote by Lois lowery. The main characters in the book are the Giver and a boy named Jonas. The setting is the community that is in the book. The main conflict of the book is Jonas doesnt like the community. A special issues is the community is a dystopia. My opinion about the book was I didnt like it because of the fact that the community was trying to be perfect.
4,Fast paced and engaging,"SPOILER ALERTHigh interest book for middle grade readers. Some sensitive issues are covered, opening up opportunities for dialog and discussion about euthanasia, socialism, etc. If you have a reluctant reader in your family, this book may be worth looking at. My son is a reluctant reader, even with a higher than average reading level for his age. This was one of the few books he has read without a lot of nagging. However, the topics contained in this book would not make it suitable for a kid under the age of about 10 or 12."
4,My Two Cents,"I realy enjoyed reading this book. It started off a bit confusing but as the story progressed, everthing began to fall into place and make sense. This was one of those books that keeps you thinking about it for several days after you read it. It involves a way of life unimaginable to the standard person and really presesnt the question ""what if..."" I would recommend this book to younger readers with an imagination."
4,A good intro book for kids to dystopian literature.,"For a young adult title, this book was quite intriguing. It is a dystopian novel in which a child is chosen to be the person that will carry on all the knowledge that society keeps from the general public. He starts questioning society and has to decide what he should do. Very quick read."
4,VHS-The Giver Review,"Echoing the warnings of a not-so-distant future that have been laid before her by Bradbury, Huxley and Orwell, Lois Lowery provides a glimpse of a frightening future. There is no burning of the books here--they are just hidden. There is no forced mating--children are birthed, then given to a set of parents--who didn't have the ability to have the children, or even chose their spouse. Without giving too much away, this book is a look at a future in which people do not have past memories, do not think for themselves, and live in ""Communities"" in which every aspect of their lives are regulated."
3,A quick read,"This is not a bad introduction to dystopian literature. It's certainly more suited to younger readers. There are plenty of themes in the book that are never fully developed. The concepts are interesting and thought provoking, but the resolutions in the story are unsatisfying."
2,"OK, but only if you like utopian/distopian literature.","I read this book in one day, but it wasn't really that great, in my opinion. It seemed just like all the other utopian/distopian books I've read. However, if you like this kind of literature, then go for it."
2,Review-The Giver,"I did not like this book at all. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I like books THAT MAKE SENSE! The Giver had nothing to do with reality and did not make much sense at all. For example- where did it take place? I had to write a report on it with a paragraph of the setting...and I had to say 'a community'. I'm sorry but I don't really understand where everyone is getting the idea that this book is 'perfect' and all. I mean I can KINDA see where your coming from if you were to say that the book makes you think or is intresting. Because I'm not going to lie The Giver was OK and intresting to read and get away from it all...but it's a LITTLE over the top.I was giving MY opinion,-Megan V.-"
2,Newberry for this?,"I don't understand what's the big deal about this book. Having read tons of scifi, I expected more from a Newberry winner. What I got was a rehash of The Lottery, with the typical utopian society so immersed in its own sickness it can't see straight. This book is all right for younger audiences, but I like more complexity and originality in my books."
4,The Giver by Lois Lowry,"Imagine that you live in a world where everything operates in an orderly fashion and pain, anguish, crime, poverty, hunger, prejudice, racism, sexism and other societal ills have been eliminated. It is just such a society that young 12-year-old Jonas lives and we are given a glimpse into this idyllic community.The Gift by Lois Lowry opens as Jonas is approaching his twelfth birthday which is also the year of a milestone where the young persons, reaching the age of twelve, enter into adulthood, are given their vocational assignments, and enter into a period of apprenticeship. Jonas is bestowed a great honor when he is selected as the next Receiver of Memory.Jonas' world quickly turns upside down as he learns that his society, which has totally eliminated individuality and personal choice, is not as perfect as he once thought.This is a wonderful book and the ending is quite poetic."
4,No one is perfect,The book is worth reading because it has excitement and mysterious. It can inspire the readers who grew up learning that everything is perfect while it is supposed not to be. The age does not matter only if you have courage to face challenges.
4,The Giver,The Giver is a book that will blow you away. In this book 11-year-old Jonas is faced with the challenges of life. A ceremony called the ceremony of twelve is about to take place. During the ceremony Jonas will be given a job but something happens that Jonas isn't ready for. As he does his job he realizes he must run away but will he get by the security. If he does will the community realize what they did that changed the world or will they simply suffer. Read this masterpiece and you will find out the answers to these questions and you will enter a whole new world.
4,The Giver Review For VHS,"I thought that ""the Giver"" was a very good book. It really makes you feel for the people who are involved in the story. I was kind of upset because of hoe the people lived. It was very disturbing and is kind of a wakeup call for the plunge that society today is taking. I hope that their society isn't like a foreshadow about what ours might become. The lead character was a very heroic boy who was only 12 years old and by how the society was, had to start his working life right away. I really did think that the giver was a really good book."
2,Not All That It is Puffed Up To Be,"Although in my book club this got high reveiws, I completely disagree.I could not catch on to the story. Before I could used to the beginning of the concept, I was on the last page. The whole""perfect world"" idea was original, but hard to both comprehend it as the meaning and stick to the idea. It was ... different. However, the ending wasn`t very clear. You could not tell what happened to the main character at the end, so it did not work well for me.Original, but not for me."
5,Amazing,I read this book in high school and it influenced the rest of my life. It was very eye-opening =)
4,"great book,but ending?","i totally loved this book but u r not sure if it is a happy or sad ending. if it is a happy ending and the aurther made it clear i would give this book 5 stars, but if it is a sad ending i would give the book 3. i just really wish i could know what happened!"
4,good up till the end,"Well, this was an excellent read. No doing about it, this was a good story. But the end comes too quick, too fast. it seemed like the author just wanted to wrap it up. but i still recommend this book."
3,It's Worth the Read,"Lois Lowry's The Giver has been enjoyed by generations of young adults, and older ones as well. It is a very good book with superficial and deeper meanings, and is a great study in contrasts and how our society might one day turn out. It just seems basic, written in a simplistic style. It is easy to follow, easy to understand, and fun to analyze. Deeper messages abound, and it has a few morals and interesting lessons about family, friends, and relationships tossed in as well. It also deals with the idea of being different in a world where everything feels the same. It has good development, and I highly recommend it to middle school students and anyone who hasn't read it. An old classic for modern times in a future world, it is truly generation-spanning. Having read The Giver multiple times, I still am not enthralled by it. However, I prefer elaborate stories, so don't be put off it. I myself did not love it, but it's worth being read."
3,"Awesome Story, Thought Provoking...","The Giver was a good book. The story captivated me, but something was missing in it. I was always hoping for something more to happen. The book in my opinion was way to short (188 pages). The ending was just horrible. I wanted so bad for the next book to be the continuing story, but it does not. For such a great story I am disappointed that I will not learn was happens to Jonas, the Giver, or the community...I am not one for drawing my own conclusions..."
5,A wonderful story about the true meaning of life,I absolutely adore this story. I read it for the first time when I was 12 and I just read it again as I am about to give it to a group of girls I tutor. This book has some wonderful things to say about the beauty of life and the dangers of conformity. I would recommend it to anyone 11 or above because there are some things in it that may be a little too emotionally taxing for younger readers.
4,To The Author,"I thought the book was very interesting. I like what you did at describing the ""community."" The way you didn't make it sound plain and ordinary. I also liked the way you used very discriptive words with this book, because it makes it more interesting.I thought the ending was a little bit overwhelming, because of the hang off. You just left us there wondering what would and what could have happened to Jonas. ""The Giver"" needs a sequel though. It's hard to read a book not knowing the end and than you don't find out what happened.Overall I thought the book was really great, just a few adjustments and it could have been better.-AMM"
5,The Best Book Ever,"The Giver was the best book ever! Jonas, the main character, lives in a Utopian society where everything is perfect and his life is all well until he becomes ""a twelve"" and he is given the honor of upholding all of the community memories. The Giver passes good and horrible memories to Jonas, that he will have to bear for the rest of his life. Jonas becomes scared and he doesn't know what to do. The Giver helps Jonas and throughout the book they become very close friends. This book always keeps you interested, and you won't want to put it down!"
4,The One and Only; The Giver,"Jonas is a young boy who is twelve years of age. Jonas lives in an utopian society where everything has the characteristic of being the same. The Elders of the community, who act as dictators, assign Jonas the position The Receiver. Jonas is instructed to receive memories of ancient civilizations from The Giver. Jonas receives memories of pain, love, hunger, war, color, and fear. These things have never been felt by Jonas or anyone except The Giver before. Upon realizing that he is living in a wonderland of sameness, Jonas plots to run away from the community in hopes of arriving at at place where ""real"" life exists. Enduring through the hard journey of escape, Jonas experinces these feelings first hand. Lois Lowery does a fantastic job of illustrating a world with no feelings. The Giver flows smoothly and is a easy reader but beware, after reading it you will never look at the feelings we have the same way."
4,The Giver,"This is a book that is colorfully written by Lois Lowry. This is a science fiction book that has a lot of ambition of what a perfect community would be like. I think that this one of the best books that I have read in a long time.This science fiction book is focus around the main character (Jonas). Jonas a t Age 12 gets the privilege of the receiver of Memory. His teacher is an elderly man by the name of The Giver. The Giver is the Receiver of Memory before him. During his training he is given the memories of the past world. He alone knows what is to feel pain, fear, hunger, and many other emotions. When he se's his father do some thing of complete horror to him he decides that he can't stay in the community much longer. So he runs away with the help of The Giver.This book is one book that you could read over and over again. It is even easy enough for a 10 year old to read. But in the end this is a good book."
3,"owen marston orrhs mattaposeit mass * good book""","The giver was an excellently writen book. The content is more adult natured but it is a good class room read. it opens the minds of younger children to the horrors of life that is all around them. to the things that they have become acostomed and desensitised to. maybe if everyone read the giver and was taught how horrible and yet natural a thing death is than things like colombine high school shootings would never take place. a good read, i belevie this book could change some people in some way."
3,My impression of the book,"The novel ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry deals with a boy who lives in a strange community and who find out what real life means.In the community where he lives the people don`t know what love is, they havn`t feelings. But there are one person who has all the memories yet, and the boy has been chosen to receive them. But with the new feelings he can`t live in the community, and together with his teacher, who give him the memories he makes a plan to escape....I like this book, because it gives you a new point of view of your life. It makes you think about your life and the future.The novel is very exciting! Only the ending doesn:t please me becaus you don`t know what will happened...."
3,How the world changes colors,"I thought this was a good book, even though it confused me a bit, but it shows the true colors of the world and the people. I feel that this book is a good example of how things can change just by the people that come in and out of our lives. It makes you feel something that someone or something couldn't. This was a good book for the people to understand, love, peace, and the true meaning behind life."
3,The Giver,Jonas is a boy who lives in a very strict world. Every thing has it's right time nothing ever goes wrong. This book has a very boring beginning thats why I gave it three stars but after a little it becomes really good. Jonas is assigned to the most honored job in his community(Receiver of Memory) then he will have to face a very hard training where he face happenies and pain. I recommened this book because it will make you think a little and it is still very intresting. Just don't give up at the beginning because it is boring. Just keep on reading.
5,Unforgettable,"Amazing book, period. It shows a futuristic society and a young boy's plight within it. He is chosen to be a special kind of savior for the society, and the book chronicles how he deals with that responsibility/burden. The boy lives in a utopia, but of course utopia is not possible and he is the only one who sees the shortcomings in his society. It is a struggle for him to be the only one who understands these things. This is the kind of book that you cannot put down; every time I have read it has been in one sitting. It's short enough so that you can do that, but such a powerful story is packed within it. When people ask me my favorite book ever, this one invariably comes to mind first. If you haven't read it, you are missing out on a lot."
4,"Great Book, Horrible Ending","I loved this book in the begining and in the middle. The way the society is described is amazing and well written. I expected the end to be great and clear up some of the mystery. BUT I never would have guessed such a cliff-hanger! It didn't tell you anything at all. Cliff-hangers are good in a series, or at the end of a chapter. NOT at the end of the book! It leaves too much to guess. I hated the ending but the rest of the book was good. I definently recommend it."
4,ThE gIvEr,"This book was read in our English class, and I fully enjoyed it. Lois Lowry is an amazing author, and her story of The Giver, kept all our attention. The way she wrote of the future is unbelievable. Jonas' world was perfect until he became The Receiver. Then he learned of pain and war. Although many people are not sure what happened to Jonas at the end and have some ""unanswered questions"" I believe that Jonas and Gabriel died. When they are on the sled they talk about Elsewhere and they become warm and joyful. This is a wondeful book, though, that EVERYONE should read."
4,The Giver Review by Girl with long last name @ BJH,"Lois Lowry has done an extraordinary job with the book, The Giver. It is well written and full of exciting plots. I really liked how she introduces and showed the true meaning of Release. My favorite part of the story was when Jonas ran out of the community because it was thrilling. How she describe was great. The part I disliked was the ending. It left too many unanswered questions like what exactly happen to him? Or what happen at the community after Jonas left? Another reason I didn't like was that she makes to many mistakes in her book. An example would be like she said that the people in the community didn't know what were animals, yet they knew what was salmon. Other then that the book was great. I really recommend this book to kids about 10 years old and higher because if younger kids read it, they would understand it that well. Hope you will get a copy of The Giver after reading my review!"
4,Outstanding,"The Giver is a suspensful book that keeps you guessing on what Lois Lowry is trying to get to. Then when you find out what she was trying to get to and you will say ""ohh. I get it."" It is interesting because the book is almost opposite from the way we live here.The only downfall is the ending because you have so many answers to choose from of how the book ends. I wasn't a big fan of the ending but you might so find out by getting The Giver."
4,Understanding The Giver,"This book makes us wonder if anything is perfect. In this book, Lois Lowry eloquently describes Jonas in the search for truth within a seemingly utopian community. Everything in this amazing book means something. The name Jonas comes from the name Jonah, meaning peace. But why would Lois Lowry have a character search for peace in utopia? Lois Lowry's epic about the dystopia within a utopia will leave you shivering, yet wondering."
3,ok book,"we read this book in 7th grade. it was an ok book, kind of odd in some places. I don't know, i just didn't really like the ending. but i have read much worse."
2,Giver,I did not like this book very much because well it did not makesence to me because well it was not a good book. I would not reccomendit to anyone no matter what because well i think they will not like it. I did not like the ending it just ended and it did not make sence to me. I liked how they decribed the community and how they decribed the memories Jonas recived and the memories Giver had of his past and other things like that. I liked Asher Jonas's bestfriend and Fioena too and i liked how they decribed Gabe in the book and how they decribed Gabes eyes how Gabe looked a little like Jonas. The other characters in the book were Lilly and mother and father and the old people that Jonas knew and the commity of elders and every one that he knew.
2,Great book,"One of the best books I've ever read. A quick read but you can't put it down anyway. It is fairy-tale, Brave New World re-visited, and profound moral proclamation all in one. Lowry wants you to use your imagination at the end. At first I didn't like this. I wanted something more real. In retrospect, however, I've come to see that there is no room for reality and, at the same time, room for much, much more."
3,Meh...,"Meh. Maybe because I have read a lot of dystopia now? I just found this boring. And the ending stinks! But I didn't care even then what it meant. I am not the slightest interested in reading the next book. If it came to be for free I might try. I am again sad that I can't dance to everyone else's idea of fabulous, classic clucking. But guess I must sway to my own waltzes."
4,Could have been 5...,I would have given it 5 stars if not for the abrupt and disappointing ending...I just thought/wanted there to be more.
4,The giver is a metaphor of life in an ordinary town.,"""The Giver"" was an interesting, well written book. It portrays the life of an ordinary boy growing up in an seclusive town refered to as the ""Community"". The main character Jonas grows up in the community until he's a ""12"" which is the beginning of your adult life. When Jonas is given his ""assignment"" which is like his lifetime job. He is given ""reciever of memory"". He then learns of everything that the town is secluded from. When Jonas learns about the outside it scares him to know what's on the outside. He also learns what people are really like and it scares him to a point where he feels he needs to leave the community all together. This book is portrayed excellently of how a perfect town can easily become twisted around to someplace scary."
5,The Best Book I've Read In a While,This book really gives the reader a perspective of what it is like in a perfect world. It really makes you think.
4,the giver,"The GiverBy:Lois LoweryI am a hard person to like books,but when my teacher read this book out loud it was astonising.This book is about a community that chooses a kid who has to feel all their pain. I'm not going to tell you all of the story, but its a great book and you,ll probably like it!I think the reasion why she wrote this book is becuse this might be the future!?!"
2,Seaford Reader,"The Giver was an ok book. It is a long read, but left you with a cliff hanger after every chapter. It kept me thinking the whole entire book. It was a little confusing and a not so good book."
2,The giver,"After reading the giver I found it to be disappointing. It was gory, violent, and confusing at some parts. And then at the end it left much of the original plot unexplained. But at that, there were a few good parts. It's an okay book but I would not recommend It. But hey as the reader that's YOUR choice."
2,The Giver,"InThe Giver by Louis Lowery the main character in the book is Jonas lives in a perfect world and becomes the new reciever and tries to escape. It is set in a world that tries to have perfect community. In the book the main conflict is that the community tries to be perfect and jonas does'nt like it. It is a dystopia world because it is a disaster,but they are trying to make it a utopia. Even though the book won a Newberry medal I don't think this is a good book because it is boring and makes no sense. I suggest no one reads it."
3,the giver,"Jonas has just been chosen to be reciever of memory, a job for few. He has a dad a mom and a sister named Lily.he lives in a perfect community, well almost. The community is ran by the elders. Everyone must do there part in the community. if a child does not grow properly it will be realesed.This was not the best book i've read. first of all i dont like sci-fi books. Im more of a civil war novel type. the book mooved realy slow, there was no part in the book to real dive in."
3,A must read book on a perfect society!,"The Giver would be a great book to read if you wanted to get a sense of what it would be like to live in a perfect society and compare it to how our society is today. Jonas, the main character of the story, lives in a community where everyone is presumed to be perfect and no freedom of expression was allowed. These people had no understanding of how it would be to feel love, pain, or happiness. This community was controlled and assigned by a group of elders. This has reflected on our society today since now we have the media and politicians trying to govern our lives. We have laws to obey, and yes we may decide to act on illegal actions,yet there are always consequences that we have to face. We might not realize this but this has reflected and exists in our society today."
4,enthraling,The Giver is a very good book. It gives a different way of living and looking at the world. You will love Jonah and the Giver. I read this book in 3 grade and still love it in 7 grade. I encourage all of you to read it and keep an open mind.
4,An Interesting Concept,"The book, The Giver was very interesting. It made me think of all the problems in our society today, as well as all the problems with a ""Perfect Land."" it shows how a utopia might not be a utopia without feelings. This book was a very interesting book, that made me think about our life today."
4,A Fight to be Different,"""He killed it! My father killed it!"" This is a quote said by the main character, Jonas, and is one of the many quotes that keep you hooked on this book.I liked this book for many reasons. It made me realize how great my daily life is compared to those in the book. Wouldn't that be hard to live in a place and you know nothing about it? I found it a little strange that they had no individuality and at Ceremony, each child got the smae thing to resemble their age. Everyone is sort of trapped in this little Community they call home. In these ways, I enjoyed the book The Giver"
5,The Giver,The product was received in a very timely manner. The books were of good quality at a good price. We saved even more money by qualifying for the cheap shipping rate.
5,"Though I'm only 8, this has been the best book ever.","Though I'm only 8, this has been the best book ever. The two possibilities at the end were one of the most interesting things to me. The characters were very well put together and it was very nice to listen to the dialogue. Even though they had no difference, they showed it for inside. For example, Fiona was gentle, Jonas was brave, and Asher was funny. So even if you try to make people exactly the same, you can't."
3,The Giver Review,"The Giver was an example of good literature because it had a surprising ending, it had lots of interesting details, and it was full of feelings. The text had a surprising ending because in the text I was ready for a great ending and then it said something about echoes. It had a lot of interesting details like all people looking the same and how people don't have feelings for other people, and the story was full of feelings when Jonas sat at the table with his family and they all shared their feelings. ""Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo."" This text is good literature because it has a surprising ending, it had lots of interesting details, and it was full of feelings."
4,The Giver is an outstanding book!,The Giver is a great book for ages 8 and up. It's a book about never giving up and doing what you belive. In the society that Jonas lives in everything is the same. No one can see color and they have many rules that they have to live by. It is very interesting the way that these people live compared to the way that we live today. This is the one book that I have read and enjoyed. Once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down.
4,A good book that everyone should read!!!!!!,"The Giver was a great book by Lois Lowry. It is a story about a community where all of the memories are held by one person ""The Reciever"". ""The Reciever"" is becomming older and so he needs to train a new reciever. Jonas is honored with this posistion. Jonas starts to recieve the memories from the reciever who is now called ""The Giver"". Jonas feels that the community is missing out on many exciting things that only ""The Giver"" and him can experience. Jonas and ""The Giver"" decide on a plan to give the community back the memories. You have to read the book to find out what happens."
4,The Giver is a very good book and is great for young adults,"My opinion of this book is that it was very well-written and you really get to know the characters, and I like that. Books like these are very good for young adult readers and I recommend that if you haven't read this book yet that you get your hands on it now!"
3,It was a good book and made you wonder about alot of things.,I read the book the Giver and I think that it has a lot of morals in it. It shows you that nothing is perfect no matter how hard you want it to be there will always be flaws. It also states that you should be grateful with what you have. I think that everyone should read this book so everyone will be a little more grateful.
5,This is one of the BEST books I have read!,The Giver was a easy book to fallow and did a great job of keeping you intrest in the book the whole time. This book did a great job of explaining the situation befor it went on to another.The book went at a understandable paste so the reader could get the whole concept. The book is diffrent in so many ways and the author dose a amazing job discribing a placing things in order.I really enjoyed this book and would read it again if I had to.
1,Book was amazing.... Kindle rendition was flawed. DO NOT BUY!,"I loved this book, until the last page. It was black and unreadable. How horrible is it to get a book you love and not know how it ends?"
2,The second chapter,"Hello ladys and gentleman,we are here to say to that the book is very boring for us.... We have read the first two chapters, and we don't understand the whole story...We don't like the story... it's boring. But if you like it it's ok... we see..."
2,Bad Science and a Bad Outcome,I'm not sure what lesson the author intended but I wouldn't want my children to read this book. Better that they should read Heinlein.
2,The Giver,"This book is about a 12 year old kid named Jonas. He lives in a world were they are trying to create peace everywhere, where there is no criminals or poor. Every family is perfect with two children. when the kids turn 12 the get a job that suites them the best. Older people teach them about how to do thier job correctlly, Jonas happens to get the giver, who knows things about the past that Jonas doesnt know. Everyone lives in the perfect happy world of our dreams.THE GIVER is written by Lois Lowry. It's a fictional book. i didnt like this book because it didnt make any sense realy to me and the parts that did i thought that they were dumb. I think this book is best suited for people who love to read or read a book every day, unlike me.that is my book review on THE GIVER."
5,Giver: Great Book,"I thought that Lois Lowry's ""The Giver"" was an awesome book. Some may find it disturbing, but even if it is disturbing, the way it was written was a style that I enjoyed. Lois Lowry also has other books related to the Giver, but although I haven't read them, I will always think The Giver was my favorite. I had to read it in my gifted reading group, but am glad that I had to. The Giver is banned in some libraries, but I found it complex in some ways, but simple and logical in others. Hopefully you, reader, will enjoy this book as much as I did!Other books in the series with the Giver:MessengerGathering BluePlease enjoy this book if you buy it or already own it!!!"
1,Not enough Detail,"Really most people would like this book, but personally I think the author didn't go into enough detail on how the society *It was a completely socialistic society* was created, how they made it so people couldn't see color, and other such things. It was creative, but not in very much detail, and I would recommend this to most people, but not to the one's like me who like to see how (In the writer's opinion) these things would be done."
1,'The Giver' Inappropriate for less than 8th grade,"When Jonas at age 12 receives the assignment of 'Receiver of memories' he learns more about his society of sameness than he cares to. As a Teacher I found this book troubling that schools would sanction the reading of 'The Giver' for anything less than 8th grade. The book talks about 'releasing' people and if you have the misfortune of reading it, as you can guess, it equates to euthanasia. I read it before my son's 6th grade class completed the book due to a newspaper article I had read 3 years ago.My son has had nightmares ever since. He does not understand why someone would write a book like this. Although there are some redeeming qualities about 'sameness' this is a book I would not recommend in any capacity."
1,The Giver,The book is very good to sommeone that cares to read books. But I am not a big reader so I didn't understand it. I bet it would have been a good book if I had had time to realy sit down and read it but I nerver had time to do that so it wasn't able to get to understand...
1,Chris's Revew Of Tha Truth,"The title of this book is The Giver by Lois Lowry. I think that this book was written for younger kids because I'm 15 years old and I did not like it at all.This book is about a kid that lives in some society that is made up. The kid is waiting to turn 12 for this special meeting, to go see the giver. So he sees the giver and runs away.I do not read many books unless I am forced to read them for school. And this book is different then the other 2 books I remember reading because, it is a whole different type of book.I did not like this book at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone even if it is there grade level because it puts false thoughts in people's heads. This is what I think and nothing is going to change that."
1,A Horribly Written Work of Fiction,"This book is horrible. I read it in reading class at school. It is not thrilling, to me it is boring, and the plot is just plain shot. It is about a boy named Jonas who was picked at the age of twelve to be the new Giver. Come on now, who's society picks your job at the tender age of twelve? Don't waste your money on this book, but if you're curious about it because of my review, I advise that you check this piece of crap out from the library."
1,THIS IS SICK!,"THIS BOOK IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT ANY CHILD SHOULD BE READING! I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO MY CHILD'S SCHOOL ABOUT THIS AND I PRAY THAT PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THIS BEFORE THEY LET THEIR CHILD READ IT! CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS' FATHER KILLED A BABY. THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TRASH AND THEN WE GIVE THIS BOOK TO OUR KIDS TO READ FOR A GRADE! IF YOU THINK THIS BOOK IS GOOD, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXAMINE YOURSELF. HOW COULD THIS HAVE WON AN NEWBERY AWARD! PLEASE, IF THERE ARE CHILDREN'S AUTHORS READING THIS, P L E A S E! WRITE SOME HAPPY AND ENCOURAGING STORIES FOR OUR KIDS TO READ AND ENJOY!"
5,it is very interesting and great book,i think the giver is one of the best books i ever read. i was only 11 when i read it so there were some parts i did not quite understand. i read it again when i was 12 and it made much more sense to me. i think this book is great for young adults and i'm sure i'm going to keep reading it again and again.
3,The Giver teaches a boy in the Community.,"""The Giver"" was a very enjoyable book because it has good lessons on how families should spend time together and how children should be taught to be resopsiable. The ceremonies were important events in the Giver. Children one though twelves are recognized at annaual celebrations. At the age of eight children receive a new jacket with small buttons and the first pocket . This teaches children to keep up with their belongons. they also receive volunteer hours. They must be responsiable in order to do volunteer. I think it is a good idea to teach children responsibility."
4,A good school book,"We read this book in our English lessons. At first it was difficult to understand but after a while we couldn't stop reading. We were fascinated how our future might be. It was difficult to imagine living without feelings and being totally equal. The book gave us an impulse to think about our life and we realized how great ordinary things like snow, sunshine, colours and feelings, of course, are."
3,Full of Thought,"I would reccomend the book to others because it makes you really think, digging deep inside to make assumptions or gathering opinions. Rather than a 'no thought to it' book, it actually talks about serious issues and topics: you have to stop sometimes for it to actually consume and sink into the harshness of it. The misery is deep and compelling, dragging you deeper and further in the book so you can't let go of it. It was deep and emotional."
4,Awesome book,I give it a thumbs up and I will definitely be buying the next book in the series by Lois Lowry
5,Powerful story,"This is a classic. Powerful, compelling, original. If you're like me, and love to read, you'll love it. If you're not like me, and hate read, you'll love it too."
3,I could hardly put it down after the first four chapters.,What a great book! I had a very hard time at the first of the book. I did not know how in the world I was going to get through the first four chapters when it is setting everything up. As soon as I hit the fifth chapter I could not put the book down. It was so entriguing. It was all I could do to keep reading to find out what happened to each character. I really feel like everyone that has a chance to read should start today. I have recommended it to many people so far. She is a very intelligent writer.
4,CONFUSING YET GOOD,I thought the book was pretty good it was unique and veryinteresting.The plot was good to because it was perfect for thestory.The characters were so interesting and so not like the people of today.The whole story to me was the making you feel thankful for what you have and if things were always perfect it doesn't mean it would be a good thing.Over all it was an amazingly interestibg book.
4,Interesting idea makes a great book,"I've read this book several times, and I've enjoyed it each time. The ending has always seemed a bit contrived to me, as if Lowry was up against a deadline and needed to end the story.Just the same, the idea of a society in which all choices were outlawed and they needed a single person to carry all their memories and their history is intriguing. It's a book to make us appreciate the society we live in, knowing that even if we do often make the wrong choices, at least we have the ability to make those choices."
4,"Great book, ambigous ending","I read this book last year (7th grade) and it gives an interesting look into the concept of Utopia. Before reading this book, I had already read 1984 and Animal Farm (both of which were better, IMO) and this gave a different perspective than them. You probably already know the plot, so I'll save you the time, but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. I understand that it is supposed to be left up to you to decide what happens, but still, it was dissatisfying, and made me not appreciate this otherwise superb book as much."
2,It was boring and confusing at the same time,"It was hard get into book because it was moving too slow and confusing. And question did Jonas die or not? This book deserves only two stars to me.The only thing about the book I agree with it's a very ""tripped out"" book."
2,boring book,"Im 15,and i tought that this book takes to much time to get to the punch line and what about that ending, come on, what happens does he die does he get to an other place is he hallucinating i dont know it was a very boring book and i do not recommend it to people my age they will find it boring trust me i read it."
4,"Very Interesting, Keeps you reading!",I really enjoyed this unique book. Jonas kept my attention throughout the book. I felt as though I was receiving the memories with him. Hooray for Jonas and his courage! A must read for junior readers.
3,I've read this before...,A mixture of divergent and matched this book is a futuristic alternate world where everything is monitored and controlled.Jonas is chosen to become the next receiver of the memories amd feelings of the entire humanity and in his journey he decides to scape repression and find a different world. A better world. He takes baby who is destined to die with him and they make it.It was alright I guess.
4,The Giver review,"We highly recommend this book because it is such a good one. The book was very suspenceful. Jonas was portrayed so well that it kept us all interested. Once you start reading this book you wont be able to put it down! You get caught up in the futureistic events that take place. Jonas story is unlike anyone elses, it is full of surprising events. When you read the book you feel like you are stuck in the middle of the book. In conclusion this book is a very good one and we think that you should take the time out and read it !"
3,the giver,"I personally like to read stories with more realistic qualities than the Giver, by Lois Lowery had to offer. However, if you were looking for some real fiction, this would be a good choice. This story is a very easy read about a boy growing up in a community of all `sameness' where members of the community have everything laid out for them such as their spouses, their children and their careers. Jonas, the main character, is given a big role in the community that is supposed to be an honor that only pushes Jonas away from his friends, family and community. Also, along with finding the story extremely unrealistic, I found it was still sad and almost depressing. Not a bad story for an open mind or a young child."
4,The Giver,"This book is a well done view into a ""perfect world"" scenario. What would we have to give up for it? What would we have to forget?The Giver raises interesting questions on what it means to be human, what it means to truly live."
4,The Giver,The giver is an outstanding book. This book shows how the lives of the people in the community is different than that of ours. Their life was more protected and kept to themselves than ours is. Our life is just plain out unpredictable.At first I thought the book was boring because I dont usually like how books just take so much time in explaining the background of the story. I like books that just start out with the story then slowly have flash backs and tell what happened in the past. This book got interesting when Jonas became the Reciever of memory. Therefore I liked the book and i recomend that many people should read this.
3,A NiCe b00k0r,The book is about a boy who lives in a communtiy. He gets selected to be the new receiver of the community. He gets the memories of the whole past from a person who saved them for his whole life in his BIG brain. By getting this memories ( f.e. of snow or love ) he forms himself a opinion about the community and the rules. He wants to leave the community to give the memories back to the inhabitants...
4,An excellent novel!,"The Giver takes place in a Utopian society where everything is under control and there are no choices, war, fear, or pain. I think that the author, Lois Lowry, presents a glimpse of what our world could one day be like through the eyes of a young boy named Jonas. It would be a world with no war, pain, and homelessness, but also no love,feelings, colour, and happiness. In this novel, I think that the author presents us with a powerful thought that forces us to reflect about our lives until we can really appreciate the true meaning of life. I would strongly recommend The Giver to anyone of any age, because I feel it has a significant meaning to get across to all its readers. The Giver is an excellent novel that ultimately depends upon the opinion and interpretation of each of its readers to create the ending. If you ever need a book to read, try reading The Giver, I would be surprised if you didn&#65533;t enjoy it!"
3,Why I like the book.,"I like this book becouse it made me think and it is a lot like other stoies.I didnt under stand all of it and some of it is still confusing to me aswell.This book kind of put me in a spot of where i dont know what is going to happemn next!!! At the end I was not such what realy happened, But I wish there was more!!I had to think a lot to understand most of it, and the other stuff I just will never know. I think if you like to read, you sould read ths book. If not this is not the book for you. This is a good book. -sixth grader."
4,All Hail The Giver,"I thought that this book was very good. It shows you how life would be like if you did not have to make life choices. It was also really sad. I really liked Jonas because I could really relate to him, when he talks about his nervousness due to him wanting to know how his life is going to turn out. This book is good for anyone who has time to read an easy fun book that you should enjoy."
3,The Giver: A Review,"The Giver is a futuristic novel about a ""perfect world"" where there are no choices, no emotions, and no color. On the twelth birthday of children, their lifelong job is chosen by the Commitee of Elders, and they begin training. Jonas, a twelve year old in this society is given the job of Reciever. The Reciever's job is to keep all of the memories of the past, and use the memories and the knowledge that the memories give him to advise the Commitee of Elders on big decisions. When Jonas begins training with the ""Giver"" he learns about the world before ""sameness"", learns about pain and suffering, but also learns of true joy. The Giver is a good book, though disturbing. It isn't really a ""feel-good"" novel, but it is thought provoking and interesting."
4,A Real Page Turner!!!,"I really liked this book! There was a few proubles with it though. I recomend this book for people how like an ending that dosn't tell what happenes to the charters. I think that the author should have told us me of what happened in the end. Another prouble with the book is that it has a lot of counter dictions. It say they don't have guns, but a few pages later they do.I think it was not as rewarding at the end of the book. I still will recomend the book, becuse it has a lot of good twist in it. As I said it is a page turner!! I think most of the book is pretty good!"
4,Great Book for Kids,"There are two themes in this book which I really liked. The first, as Jonas learned after becoming the Receiver, is that without pain and sorrow, people are less able to appreciate joy. The second theme I liked was that the freedom to make one's own choices and determine one's own fate necessarily involves accepting the risk of making mistakes and failing. These two themes made the book worthwhile for me.I felt the book started out a little bit slow, and the ending left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied, but from the point where Jonas becomes the Receiver up to the point where he and the Giver make their fateful decision, this book was an interesting read with a good message to it."
4,Life isn't safe,I picked up this book because someone told me it was a science fiction and I am always on the look out for new sci-fi. I was instantly hooked. This book is a page turner. It's about a boy who lives in a community that does not have freedom of expression or freedom of choice. When he turns twelve he is chosen by the community leaders to be the receiver of the Memories. Throughout the rest of the book strange things begin to happen to him. He must confront his value system and struggle to find a place where he belongs. The ending leaves you wanting more.
3,"Courtney E. VHS Review, MHS","This book was a great read. I read this book once in fifth grade, and again this year. While thinking into the book i realized that The Giver is a great example of how society today is starting to mesh together. Everything seems the same. People are starting to look alike, dress alike, sound alike and even act alike. Shared memories are important to any and every culture. Parents and grandparents pass down stories of their past to their children, who will pass their stories on. This ritual has been going on since the beginning of time, and will continue forever."
4,A book of shared remembrance,"I enjoyed reading this book. Not only was it interesting but it was also an easy read. In the beginning, it started of by giving some backround to the story and their beliefs of the community. Then as the story goes on it shows how the boy learns that there is more to what he was brought up to know to be true. Towards the end of the book, he becomes rebellious as he starts to realize the truth. The giver's job was to give the memories of life to the receiver who turned out to be Jonas our main character and with those he felt that everyone should have the memories that the giver has fed to him. The only part I did not like to well was the ending. It was sort of a cliff hanger."
3,It's good.,I liked reading this book. It was very easy reading and has some little brain teaser like ideas that make you think about things. I felt that Lois Lowry has some very interesting messages to share with the readers. I think it is a book that almost anyone would like to read.
3,What?,"I downloaded this book onto my reader. Could hardly put it down; loved it. Until I came to the end. What? It just left you hanging, not knowing what the imagery was, not knowing whether Jonas was ""there"" or not. I looked it up online to make sure I hadn't had a hiccup when I downloaded and only got half the book. Nope. This book could have been great if the end was the middle. Very disappointing and dissatisfying."
4,Alek Dzikieleski Period 3 English,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry is science fiction. Jonas is the main character of the story. He is wierd, but everyone is wierd in the story. He and everyone else have to do a challenge once a year and get new stuff every challenge. They are cut off from the rest of the world. Airplanes cannot fly over this place when they do everyone is scared. This place is dark, no sun and surrounded by water. This book is okay, it does not have much details and this makes you want to know what happens."
4,The Giver,Great book. My daughter had to read it for language class. It was nice to be able to discuss with her.
5,The Giver,"The Greatest Book that Keeps on GivingA page turner a cliff hangerThe Giver is an excellent book that every one should read. For sci-fi lovers this is the book for you. Jonas's world is perfect. There is no fear, pain, or war. There are no choices every one is assigned something to do in the community by the Chief Elder. When Jonas starts his new job as the receiver he receives memories about love, pain, and family. Jonas wants to change his community so that not only he and the giver have to hold these memories. When Jonas tries to change the community some things go wrong but in the end everything turns out perfect for Jonas."
3,Decent,"The book was okay; not great, not awful. It's a decent ""food for thought"" read, but I tend to like a little... MORE from my reads."
5,The book,I would recommend this book to people who like the Lois Lowry books. I also got this book fast and easy.
5,The Giver,"The Giver is one of the best books I have read. It is extraordinary novel about a stable, pain-free society with no color, music, or feelings. Their world seems perfect with everyone fulfilling their assignments. When Jonas turns twelve, he fills the role of Receiver of Memory. He discovers sights, sounds, and feelings he has never had before, and he cannot share them with the other people. Jonas dicovers that his is not the perfect world and attempts to change it. I recommend this book because it is sure to keep me from taking things for granted."
2,It was confusing.,I will have to give the book a three.I didn't like this book because it was to confusing.It would say something then something else. Some thing totaly different. It was to confusing.
2,Last chapter a real letdown,"Book leaves you with no closure... which would have been fine if the last chapter didn't feel like a complete hack. Simplistic style of writing, with little to no imagination used to create this ""utopia"", but a compelling story that had me gripped up until the very last chapter... I real let down."
2,The Giver,I thought that the book was kind of weird. It was mostly about a perfect town but the did not really live the way people where made to live. Basicly they don't have feelings or know about anything from a normal town.
3,Not convincing!,"The idea of this book is really good, but the result of the idea does not really satisfy. The idea of creating a new world without any feelings,colors and no pain at all is very interesting. But because of the open end, there is no end and so there's no result how this would work in the reality."
3,The Giver- a critical review with my own opinion,I read the book The giver within 2 days and one night - It was easy to read although it was ibn a foreign language(english) for me . I liked the thought of a 'perfekt' community. Alos I liked the impression that this community had to be interrupet by someone because people wanted to have their own choices. It showed me once more how we depent on the past and how things can chagne by our own exoeriences. I didn't like the though. It was so left open I evcen was thinking about writing an own en just to satisfy my thought how it possibly COULD end -The book by lois Lowry is somehow confusing as things just go along for the first - 8 - chapters - and thoughout the whol book everything is written in such detail form that you really have to stick to the book. Otherwise I would have been drifted away so quickly.
4,The Giver is a great book,"I really enjoyed the book The Giver by Lois Lowry. It is a great book about a child in an unrealistic world. He has the job to handle the whole world's memories. It is a great book with an excellent story line. It is a must have, you should all purchase the book right now. Jonas, is the coolest kid. Plus, the story has a great meaning behind it. That is that a society who loses the past is bound to make the same mistakes, and that society can become corrupt, so don't let it happen."
4,The Giver - Audio CD Review Only,"As many reviewers noted, The Giver is a wonderful book. However, the audio CD is is not divided by chapter. Each CD contains about 14 files. They all have the same track name, such as ""track 1"". All CDs have a ""track 1"". It's confusing for the player when you load the CDs. It thinks it's the same file.Anyway, I was commenting on the audio CD itself, not the novel."
3,The Giver,"The novel""The Giver"" is about a boy name Jonas, who lived in a community where everything is perfect there. In the community, there are very strict rules that everyone has to follow them. Then, the Elders of the committee choose Jonas to be the person responsible for receiving and keeping all the memories of the past, and it is a huge task for Jonas. So when Jonas found out that there is something bad in the community, he ran away with his brother. Jonas and his little brother lived in the forest, till he saw a town. Jonas and his little brother lived in the town and stayed there."
5,Excellent Four Star Book!,"THE GIVER is an edge of your seat reader, which will not alllow you to put it down. It is a book in which describes the life of a 12 year old boy, who lives in a future community with his family unit. He is assigned a job which is one among the community, and he is trained by the giver.The community in which this excellent book takes place in, has climate control, where it is never hot, and it is never cold. The've never seen rain;the've never seen snow. Read and find out about this good but bad, adventrous story, and like I said;you will never want it to end."
4,The good review of The Giver,"This book is about a boy named Jonas and how he becomes the Giver. Jonas is just a regular boy in a community of order.There is no war,no pain,no anger,and no choices. Now the twelves ceremony has come and Jonas is chosen to be the new giver. Now Jonas has to face something he has never faced before.I gave this book four stars because it was good except for the very confusing parts. Like when Lily came home and shared what happened at school. When Jonas in the morning shared what dream he had. And the idea of you having no choices, that just blew my mind because if I lived in that community I'd SLAP somebody if they forced me to do something for the rest of my life!"
4,Review of The Giver,"The Giver by Louis Lowry if a fictional book about a twelve year old boy names Jonas. Jonas lives in a specail kind of community and at the age of Twelve, Jonas and others of the same age are given their assignments so they may start trainnig for their future jobs. Jonas was given the assignment of receiver and finds out the the community he has grown to love is all a lie. Through his training the old receiver ( also known as the Giver) gives Jonas the memories of the past. Those memories consist of sailboats, oceans, colors, and even love, but with those good memories come bad ones such as pain and war. Jonas decides that his life in the community, a life where decisions are made for him and with no individuality is not what he wants. Jonas decides to escape from the community, but will he ever find that elsewhere he wishes to find?"
4,A book that stays with you,"I remember reading this book in elementary school. I also remember that I hated this book. I could not stand it. As I grew older, I appreciated the nuances and messages contained in this ""child"" book. I recommend this book to any child or adult on what an ""utopian"" society could look like."
5,The Giver,The Giver is a wonderful book. It is a coming of age book but this coming of age is in the future. It can get us to look at our own choices for our careers and family. I participated in an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute were we discussed those topics in relation to this book. My mother was a bookkeeper so I went into accounting. Maybe this world of the future in The Giver is not far from our own world. A good book to discuss with your teenagers.
2,The Giver Review,"The Giver is not good literature. Three characteristics of good literatureinclude how it relates to you, full of action, and a surprising ending.The book did not relate to me because the community followed rulesthat completely contradicted my life. The book was not full of action. Itseemed tedious and uneventful. The ending stopped abruptly and seemeda bit dull and confusing. Jonas said, ""We are almost there Gabe."" Thiswas close to the end of the book and they still did not meet theirdestination point. As you can see The Giver is NOT good literature."
3,utopia with open ending,"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopia where everything is controlled by rules. There is neither pain nor war nor feelings. When he becomes twelve he is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. Now he gets to know the truth about the community by his mentor, the Giver, and wants to change it.Slowly the reader gets to know how the community works - in great difference to reality. The story is very different to other stories which makes it interesting. You can identify with Jonas and understand his thoughts and decisions. We don't like the ending because you can never be sure what happened to Jonas and the community. If you like reading science-fiction, you will have fun reading this book. We absolutely recommend reading it for pupils at the age of 14."
5,The Giver,This book is really good. The thing i liked most about this book was the idea that no one in their own community could see color so no one was made fun of. This book is about a kid that is given the job of being the Giver. He is the kid that will be able to see color and feel true pain. Everyone in this community is to obey all of the rules or if they don't they will be released out of the community. Also there are no twins allowed because they look the same and no one looks like someone else. This is a really good book and you should read it to find out how this books end!!!! I would recomment this book to kids that in middle school or older.
3,Keep reading,"This book was a good, quick read. The ending leaves you hanging with a lot of unanswered questions. In order to understand all of the story, you must keep reading the series. Read Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son in order to fully understand the story."
5,The Giver,"This book, The Giver, was very entertaining and interesting. I enjoyed finding the ups and downs of a ""perfect"" world. This book talked about a boy who lived in a ""perfect"" world, and was discovering throught the special ""assignment"" given to him-the Receiver of memeories-that the life and world he had always know was not as wonderful as it appeared. He learned that sometimes you need to break the rules to achieve something. Overall, this was a very good book, and I highly recommend it."
4,An adventurous thriller,The Giver was an extraordinary novel if you like fictional but adventurous books. Here is a little about this book. Jonas is a little boy who frequently sees a man by the name of THE GIVER and Jonas finds out about the world and wants to explore it to see for hisself. Jonas takes hemself and his baby brother GABE to run away and find out what the world is like. If you want to learn more read the book.
4,"""The Giver,"" an interesting work of fiction.","&#65533;The Giver&#65533; is an interesting book about a world that is controlled and is void of emotions that are painful. They don&#65533;t have vocabulary for certain words, they only have synonyms. The most important age for a person in the main character Jonas&#65533; world is 12, the age that a person gets assigned to what he or she will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas finds out that he is going to be a Receiver, and he gets special access to all kinds of memories. When he finds out what life is all about though, Jonas decides that his perfectly constructed world is wrong, and he tries to change it. The novel is a really good one that makes you wonder if something like Jonas&#65533; world will become our world someday."
4,My review,"The book ""The Giver"" from Lois Lowry deals with a community which seems to be a perfect world. In the Ceremony of Twelve Jonas receives his assignment which is ""Receiver of Memory"", where he finds out about the secrets of the community.I found the book very interesting because this community was so different from ours. Everything was organized and it seemed to be a perfect world. For me it would be unimaginable to live in a world without colours,feelings and memories. I liked the author leaving the end open and giving the reader the chance to imagine his own end."
4,"a review of ""The Giver""","I was required to read a modern fantasy novel as part of the course requirement for a Children's Literature course which I am currently enrolled in. I selected ""The Giver"" and was very pleased with my choice.I found it to be a thought provoking book that encourages the reader to evaluate his or her own position on matters such as life and death, right and wrong, good and evil. Lowry was able to create an idealistic utopian society where outwardly things seem to be ideal. However, upon closer inspection, the reader realizes that in this fictional world where there is no existance of war, hunger or poverty, there is also no evidence of emotion or freedom of choice.Provocative subject matter and the author's use of descriptive langueage makes ""The Giver"" a wonderful book for readers of all ages."
2,Good but not the best,"The book didnt realy keep my atention. There were some good parts to it though, like the dream he had about fiona. This isnt realy my kind of book, I like adventure type books that have to do with the outdoors. Overall I give it a two."
3,The Giver book review,"I thought the book was great because it had a lot of enteresting parts in the book. Almost every time it get to a exciting and enteresting part, I couldnt wait to go home and read. A little after the beggining I kind of felt a little pity for him because he was diffrent from others. Like he didnt know about the apple was one of the examples in the book that he was diffrent. To me the book was a little scary because I didnt know what was going to happend next but,it kept me reading. also, the end of the book was kind of weard. To talk about snow and things didnt have anything to do with the other parts of the book. Other than that the book was good"
5,This is a Great book.,I have read this book over and over agian because it will never be old. I read this book in the sixth grade and after we read it i knew i had to get my own copy. It was so good that used to be all i read until i read Lois Lowery's Gathering Blue. In my opinion everyone should own this book. It is the best book i have read and own. I recomend it to anyone.
4,I enjoyed this book.,"I enjoyed reading The giver because it talks about how horrible life would be without the things God has given us. It talks about being trapped in a community with ALOT of rules, you cant see color, nor feel love or anything you can do in real life. I LOVED this book..yet the ending was quite odd than other books.OVERALL, Great Book!"
3,Censorship and The Giver,"I believe that ""A dose of poison can do its work but once. A bad book can go on poisoning minds for generation"". The society is feeling to emerge the society by burning books. Well I read, but it's mostly the newspaper or I just read the news on the computer. Well, let's just say that the book The Giver is a book that shows that it isn't good to live in a perfect world. First of all, Jonas gets assigned a job by the Elders to be a giver. I think life is dull in Jonas's world. They have to follow strict laws, and they can't meet anyone outside the town like people on vacation. So, basically, what I have to say is your life is being taken over by people that you don't see all the time. I don't think you feel excitement. In my opinion I would just let the people decide on if the books should be banned, not the government."
4,LSMS,"Whoever thinks they can try to take away what our government's all about,-- freedom--, might take away our freedom of speech as well. I think that the book The Giver should not be a banned book. The book gave great details on how life would be if you had no color, no ideas, and no feelings. The security of the book really makes you appreciate how good we have it, having your feelings and fun. It also shows you how getting all the pain you get really gives you wisdom, and without that we would be lost. That's why I know the book The Giver should not be a banned book."
4,The Giver,"I thought that this book was pretty cool, but it was very confusing at the beginning. Is shows a ""perfect"" community, and how everyone in this community lives. At the end, it kind of leaves you off, not knowing what would happen, so If I were The Author, I'd probably clear up the ending some more, But I found It a very good book!!!"
3,"A well-meaning book, a slowly-moving plot","I read this book as an assignment in my English class. I think it's certainly full of revealing insights about society and what's supposed to be for the benefit of society. On th other hand: Does a story have to be so stiff, so boring and so obvious in what it is meant to say?"
5,"This book isn't particularly my favorite, however is one I..","'ll remember all my life! There is one word that can describe the story...different! The story being extremely well described taught me many vocabulary words.Whenever I spied a word I either:Didn't know or weren't sure about, I quickly jotted down to look up later. Jonas Parker, a young, strong-willed boy, finds his path in life after replacing another man and becoming the giver!"
4,Little Known Facts About the Book,"1. ""Soylent Green is made of people!"" - Charleton Heston, Soylent Green (Keep this phrase in mind while reading)2. ""Elsewhere"" and ""Whoville"" (from ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas) sound an awful lot alike. (see last three paragraphs and you'll agree)"
3,STARTS OFF BORING ENDS WIERD,This book starts off very boring. The first 50 pages areboring and I would skip over them. The middle of the book is greatand it makes you wonder about our culture and if we could make improvments on it. the end is wierd. It leaves the reader not knowing what happened.
5,Good aspects,"We really like this book because it treats new problems that we don't know: Sameness! Jonas, the main character lives in a community where all the things are the same. Because there are no colors, no music and no individuality. It's very admirable how Jonas tries to change the life in the community, as he escapes of the community. In our opinion this book must get an OSCAR! Many thanks to the author that we can read such a great fantastic and fascinating book !"
4,Incredible! A must read.,"I work with an LD student in a middle school who had to read this book. It was slow to hook, but when it does, boy it grabs you. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This book really makes you think. I recommend this book highly!"
5,"This is a great book, I would recommend it to anyone.","Great book. If you like science fiction and enriching your imagination, read this book. Lowry is a truly superb writer. I would enjoy reading one of her others also."
4,TERRIFIC READ,A fine read up till the end. I felt the end was rushed and just lackluster. It is a terrific book to think on.Tom
3,Good Utopian Story - BAD Ending,"- - Personal Background - -Back in Middle School (Jr. High), my English Teacher told me to read this book. I didn't. Years later, I'm a Computer Teacher and our school requires us to have a time for reading, too. My class read ""Anthem"" by Ayn Rand. That book reminded me of this one. So, I bought it and read it for my self.- - The Book - -It is obscurely apparent that this is a post apocalyptic Utopia. Good story all the way through...- - The Ending - -At first, I thought that there may be an error. Nope. Sequel to the cliffhanger? Not that either. According to the author, the ending is up to us... I bought the book because I wanted entertainment... because I don't have the discipline to write one myself. Think of it like the ""Soprano"" grand finale. Intentionally left blank.- - Final Thoughts - -Before I tell you whether you should read it or not, let me explain it as follows."
4,A life without feelings,"Lois Lowry`s ""The Giver""is a very interesting book.We had read it in School and analysed it. We find out that the novel is sometimes difficult to understand for the reader,because the author often uses abstract words and we didn`t nothing about the future like this.I find the book fantastic , because you get knowledge how the life could be in the future. You can take part the main persons life.But I think that the end of the book doesn`t fit the story. So we write a new end about the new life and feelings of Jonas."
2,boring book,"For us, the book ""the giver"" is written very well because the characters are well defined. But the story is boring from the beginning till the end! We would never read it again!!"
5,a grate book to read,The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a very well thought outbook.I gave this book five stars because its suspenceful threw theentire book and makes you want to keep reading. I have read this book sevral times and it has never gottin to the point where I was bored with it.
1,It had potential....,"I was intrigued by the description of this story, and when I started reading it, I got caught up in it fairly quickly. But then I started feeling like some of it wasn't explained very well. A story like this, which is obviously far-fetched, should have everything explained...but instead, much of it went without ever being clarified. For example, how can a community stop people from seeing color? How could they control the climate without some sort of border? How could they prevent other people from coming in? None of it was given any thought or explanation and it drove me crazy!I also HATED the ending. I got close and even commented to my husband that it was getting really good. And then bam, it was over. I agree with another post that said it seemed like the author got bored with writing the story and just decided to end it.I thought the idea behind the story was excellent and it would have made a really interesting read, but it simply wasn't developed enough. Disappointing."
1,Dissapointing,"This book is for children, not for teens or adults. It starts promising but there is just no ending. It goes nowhere. And therefore it was not worth reading."
1,The Giver Is A Good Book Report Book-Yet A Bad Freetime Book,"For all of you out there ""iffy"" on getting the giver-don't. It's great for a once a month book report or something, but never for fun. Believe me. It bored me to death. I mean, who wants to read about killing babies, vomiting and living in a world with no color. Your probably thinking, ""Yah yah yah. It's just one bad review"". But it's not. My brother and all my friends read it and we all hated it. So there. I'm really sorry to all these people that have to listen to this crap and even more I'd like to thank Barnes&Noble.com for publishing this review. Thank-you."
1,Scarred for Life,"This book freaked me out as a child, and gave me nightmares. I love to read, and this is one of the few books that I hate, even to this day. I'm sure if I read it again, I would get more out of it, but I can't bring myself to do it!"
5,The Giver: A Moving Story for All Ages.,"The Giver is a remarkable story about a young boy who discovers a life totally different from his own.Jonas finally turned a 12 and was very anxious to find out what his role in the community would be. After much exessive worrying, he soon learns that he is to be trained as the new Reciever of Memory, one of the highest ranking jobs in his community.Throughout his many meetings with the Giver, he learns of a totally new world. Through the shared memories of the past he can longingly look apon a world with both love, sadness, pain, family, and feeling.But now, because of his new discovery, he looks apon his world with less and less favor. Shortly afterwards an opportunity arises for him to leave his solitary community and become a member of the new world. He is faced with a difficult decision.This is an extremly powerful novel through which the author expresses courage, love, and friendship. I can confidently recommend it to all ages."
4,The Giver Book Reveiw,"The Giver by Lois LowryHow would you feel if you never knew your mom, you couldn't see colors, and it never snowed, rained, or got hot? You might not like it, but the people of the Community never knew anything else. In the community, everyone is perfectly equal. There is no crime, no poverty, and everyone thinks that they are happy. When Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory in the Community, he learns more than he could have ever imagined existed. The Giver of the memories in this book is a rescuer, because he helps Jonas out of the lie that he had been living in. The Giver had to be brave and intellegent, or else he would not have his job as the person who held the memories of the Community. I think this is an important book to read because its message is that real happiness can not exist without some insecurity. The Giver is a great book becasue it makes you think. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading, and if you don't, read it anyway."
4,The Giver delivers,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent book for readers of all ages. The plot and the themes work together beautifully to keep the reader both intrigued and guessing. You find yourself appreciating your own world and the things we so easily take for granted. The Giver shows us a world without feeling and without emotion, and one cannot help but think about ways in which our own world is also devoid of such basic necessities in life. This book will entertain, but also educate the reader about the ways in which society as a whole can so directly affect each one of us as individuals. I highly recommend this book to any reader above the age of 11."
4,I could not live like this! Very thought provoking!,"The Giver is a futuristic tale that demonstrates to the reader a possible approach to a utopian society. It clearly illustrates that the loss of freedom in such a society is a trade off for ""perfection."" Creativity is a threat instead of valued. Longevity is inappropriate. Thinking is not allowed.This book is an outstanding tool for the individual reader and the middle school classroom. The projects and discussions are endlessly possible, completely the opposite of the existence of the people who populate this novel."
4,Kristen's review,I like this book because it is interesting and different from others that I have read. Also I like it because the book is about a future that is not real. There are no animals in their make-believe world. The people can't make choices. That is why I like the book.The book is about a boy named Jonas. It's about how he was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. He and the Receiver try to think of a way to change their community. The people in the community lie about things and don't know that it is wrong. Jonas and the Receiver are the only ones who know that they are lieing and they know they're not doing things that are right.Who would enjoy this book are people who like some drama. If you like people try to do the right thing even if they have to break law in your books and all the others than you may like this book.
4,This is a excellent book for people with a big imaginations,"The giver is a book about a community in which everything is perfect. No one tells lies or do things that are considered to be wrong. Everything in the community is in black and white. The temperature never changes, it never snow, rain etc. The main character is a boy name Jonas, who got the most important assignment in the community asthe ""Receiver of Memory.""I like the way the book was creative the whole concept of a perfect community. I didn't like the way the book did a lot of explaining about how Jonas felt. It makes the book drag."
4,A very good book that challenges your mind,"The Giver gives you a little mystery with a high level thinking. As you read, it you start to imagine what it would be like if you lived there. It is really a thinking book."
5,THE BEST BOOK WRITTEN BY THE BEST AUTHOR!,"This is my absolute favorite book of all time. I could not put the book down. It's interesting to read about this colony of people you are very naive, to the outside world. You can actually live this book. You can feel the emotions and all the happenings, as if you were there. I never knew what was going to happen next! It's brilliant the way Lowry came up with such a fascinating and lively novel. MUST READ!! I'm POSITIVE you will LOVE this novel just as much as I do. So get a copy of The Giver TODAY and experience for yourself, just how intriguing this book is!!!"
3,"this book was not bad, but not good either","The giver was quite intresting at times but at others it had way too much explaning. After one or two times of someone explaining how Jonas felt, you just want them to shut up! I also believe that this book had a slow start, and that ,for me, isn't very helpful when trying to get into the book. I think that younger people wouldn't have a clue to what The Giver is about, so older people, such as fifth and sixth graders, should read this book. The reason i rated this book a three star book is just for that reason. I think it was too complicated for younger people and too boring for older people. This is just one of those books you have to read at just the right age to fully enjoy it."
3,The book was good but lacked a good ending,"The book the giver was written by Lois Lowery. This book is a great book for young adluts over 13. Any one younger than that age woulent uderstand the book. The main charecter of the book is a young boy named Jonas who lives in a community where everthing is perfect. All the decisions are made for all the people in the community. They have no color, no music, they cannot pick there own jobs, there lives are controled by a Comminty of Elders. Jonas is chosen to be a reciver of memorys, the only person that knows about how things like color look like . As he learns to feel emotions like love and feel pain he feels left out of the community. The rest of the book s abut his struggle to get away from the community. I think think book lacks a good eneding but the rest of the book has many twists and suprises"
3,The Giver,"The Giver is an example of good literature. The Giver has a very surprising ending so many questions were left on answered. This book is very adventures, especially at the end when Jonas and Gabriel escape. They have to go through different climates and temperatures that they never experienced before. This book is scary at some points like when the plane fly's over. Jonas had to give Gabriel memories in order to survive. The book says."" He knew that they could not see color, and their flesh would not be seen, they used heat seeking, so he gave the memory of cold to Gabriel"" So in conclusion the Giver is good literature."
4,The Giver,"""The Giver'' is not good literature based on these characteristics Ichose. ""The Giver'' is not good literature because the characters in thebook have no feelings. They have no feelings because it is a Utopian society,in which the people live. Another reason why ""The Giver'' is not goodliterature is not considered as good literature is because there is no adventureand action. I felt the novel was tedious because the setting of the storyoccurred within the community and there wasn't a lot of action. Lastly,""The Giver'' is not good literature because of the ending. The ending of thebook wasn't surprising. There isn't an actual ending to the book. A quotefrom the end of the story is, `'Behind him, across vast distances of space andtime, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhapsit was only an echo.'' This is why the novel, ""The Giver'' is not consideredas good literature."
3,The Giver Review,"Good literatureThe Giver is good literature based on three main reasons. First, there were tons of feelings throughout the book. The Giver transmits memories of all kinds of feelings almost every chapter. Second, there were tons of interesting details. For example, instead of saying "" Jonas fell and broke his leg"", the book goes into detail about how his leg broke. This is to show how new and painful it was to Jonas. A quote to support my answer is "" He fell with his leg twisted under him, and he could hear the crack of a bone. Finally, there was a surprise ending to The Giver. Who would of thought that Jonas would escape without being caught, and survive out in this new terrain? As you can see, The Giver is a piece of good literature."
2,Ehhhh........Too Slow,"The begining was cool and creative, but once Jonas becomes the reciever the book is too slow repetive. And oh yeah, the ending was horrible. Also it is to easy to guess what ""release"" is."
1,Blank,"I was very upset, as I did want to read this book. I received a cover page and then all of the rest of the pages were blank. I returned it and bought it again, and the same thing. Very disappointing."
3,The Giver,"Wellllllllll its an OK book. The action is a bit slow at times, but its a smrt book that makes you think. the author does a good job with plot and detail. Many kids have to read this book for school so I wouldn't buy it before checking THAT scenario out."
3,Nothing quite like it...,"I believe the Giver was a very interesting book. I loved the story line. The character Jonas was opionionated and easy to like. I became slightly attatched to the bond of Jonas and the Giver; since this is a very short book that usually doesn't happen. The ending leaves you off wondering what happened, which is kind of annoying. But overall the book was an interesting and different book. I liked how it wasn't similar to the other books I've read. It's a book you can pick up years later and reread."
3,Interesting,"The Giver is a novel that really makes you think of what the world would be like without originality. You, the reader, are introduced to the ""perfect"" community where everything is controlled and decided for you. It is a place where you never have to fear for anything. Then you meet Jonas, a young boy, who has a lot to learn...I personally would never want to live in place like this. You lose your identity in the process of trying to be similar. Being an individual is what makes life interesting."
3,Strong message with little explanation...,"The Giver is a very powerful book with a strong message and isgreat for young adults to read. The author portrayed the controlledcommunity in what seems to be a very definative manner, but failed to give a real ending to the story. The message would have been more strong if there was a sufficient conclusion to back it up with. Overall, it was still a pretty good book; I've read it several times."
3,It's not like anything I have read before.,"Jonas, the main character in this book, lives life without choices. At first I was confused because this book opened up without any sort of explanation what so ever, but as I read on I was able to figure it out and I enjoyed learning about this alternative lifestyle. As for the ending, it was not at all what I expected but I can't see how Lowry could have made it any better. Read this book, it makes you think!"
1,Frusterating,"This book to me was frusterating. i didn`t like how the people were called males and females. I thought that the book had a GREAT concept and plot but something about the book was just frusterating. I recommend this book just for the experience of reading it, but I warn you that it is very different. l guess that l just had higher expectations than it could fulfill."
1,The Giver,"The Giver is a really bad book to read because when I was reading it I did not understand what the book was trying to tell me. If you're a student, I suggest not to read this book. There are many other great books you could choose that would be much more interesting. I just felt this particular book didn't keep my interest and you shouldn't waste your time with."
1,How Disturbing!,"After reading this book, I felt very disturbed about the topic. It has no clear ending, and is just badly written. Don't read it."
1,The Giver =(,I didnt like The Giver. It was a boring book and I thought itwould be better.I didnt like the theme of the story. It was confusingand it was boring. I thought it would have been better. Well this is my opinion on The Giver book .... Have Fun Reading~~!
1,The Giver,"I do not think the book ""The Giver"" was a good book. I do not like how the community was controlled. The book takes place in the future but there technology is not any more advanced than today.It was odd how they released the elderly and the newborns.It was heartless how they released people.I thought it was wrong. It was a somewhat interesting book but I DO NOT recommend it."
1,the giver,"this book was a waste of my timethis story takes place in the future and in a society wherebabys are killed if they are not smart and if they remember things. In this story people do not see in color, only in black and white were certain clothes by gender. This sends wrong messages to kids this story doesn't make any sense at all only non-sense.I hated this book.i read it in the seventh grade and i still don't like it even though i understand it now."
1,How sad,My step daughter had to read this book for school. How sad that we give medals to books that have no message other than that of a liberal perfect world. I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way. My wife and I read the book and can't believe that there isnt't a more positive book that the schools can promote. How sad.
1,Giver Sucks,I read this book for a school prodject and i hated it it was okay at parts but most of the time it was long boring and draged on about things that had nothing to do with the plot at all. this book is very slow I would not recomend it
5,The Giver Opens Your Eyes and Makes You Question Perfection,"This book is fantastic! I am a teacher and I am truly excited to share this novel with my students...it makes you open your eyes and question the meaning of ""perfection."" Many times we speak of how wonderful it would be to live in a ""perfect world"", but I do not believe that we can comprehend what that would mean - a loss of freedom, of beauty, of innocence,of history, of love...If you are interested in reading a book that will make you thankful for all of the many great gifts we do have, pick up this treasure and enjoy it for all of its wisdom!"
5,I think that this was the most awesome book ever written.,"I am in the seventh grade and have read this book three times. Each time it was a little better. Our teacher read it to us and everyone in the room groaned aloud. After we were done, they all thought that it was a really good book. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoy's a good book now and then."
4,It was pretty good,I think this book was pretty good because i like how the author made the giver very old and wise
4,Lois Lowry gives an imaginary idea of how the world could be,"This book gave you an unsual kind of plot, not realistic but different. There are many things that could not really be, but it lets your mind expand and try to answer all of the questions you have while reading it. It is a great book that teaches you lessons. One thing I learned was that you should never take for granted. There are many things that they do not have in their community that we have today, some we could not even live without. A book that has meaning is good. You learn from it."
5,A great book that keeps you reading till the very end.,The giver was a wonderful book that I can easily say is now my favourite. It's the kind of book that provokes thought and doubts the realism of the current world you are living in.
3,the giver,i read this for school and did not want to. i realised it was a book to think about as you read. i would have never read this for fun.
3,I liked it.,"I thought it was okay. Jonas's world was weird with there being no color or animals. His dream was sick. About Fiona and the house of the old. And Rosemary being the Giver's daughter was unusal. I wouldn't like living in his world, with releasement and all. When they released the smaller twin in the forehead, I was about to cry."
2,A unique but boring book.,The Giver started out pretty good but as I read it it really started to stink. Children of 12 and under should not read it because of lack of understanding. As the end comes it realy gets annoying.
3,i did not understand it too well,can anyone help me with the ending... did the people thingk that he was dead....? but then he went back ...what happened?
2,Vapid,"There are too many loose ends in this book to make is a satisfying read for an adult. Personally, I found it vapid and wouldn't give it to a child because it lacks the kind of depth one would want to develop in a tween. Although I've read many good reviews of this book, I'm afraid it seems like a re-run of so many other stories"
3,The Ego Has Landed,"The writer has a high opinion of herself. In my opinion. She tried too hard to condense a surrel idea tightly between the covers of a short novel. There are questions left unanswered at the end and for Lowry to say in the interview that it is ""up to the reader to decide"" is confirmation of the fact that she has no idea herself what the ending is. Being esoteric and mysterious is not the answer. To live like they did in the story takes fear,(flying a plane), love (bringing up a child) and anger (bringing up a child). Ludicrous to think such tasks are impossible without the associated emotions. For a start.At the end, he glides through the snow towrds the light and the music. I think it is here where Lowry's ego crashes."
3,An Alright Read,"I thought ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry was an okay book. The storyline and plot of the book was entertaining. It was creative, and I did like it. I found the actually story to be hard to get into though, but that was mostly because of the writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fantasy or futuristic type stories. The ideas in the plot were original, but sometimes it got a little confusing what the characters were talking about or meant - especially in the beginning of the book. I felt that the wording the author used made parts of the story a little boring, but other parts kept you interested in reading more. I would rate The Giver three stars because the story itself was good, it just needed to be written with a little bit different words, so that the story flowed more."
3,Review of the Giver,"This book had a good plot. However, the author didn't do an exceptional job describing the communist-like enviorment. In the ""community"", where the story is set, everyone works for the good of the community. In this so-called perfect world which Lois Lowry has set the story, everyone is the same. Jonas, the main character in the story, gets his role in the community at the age of twelve along with all of the other children his age. He gets the role of reciever meaning he gets memories from the Giver. No one else in the community has the memories. As the plot thickens, Jonas tried to leave the community so that in turn the rest of the community will receive the memories. I disliked this book since it doesn't relate to our lives and the community is a fantasy world that we won't ever experience. The author also left out a lot of essential parts of the story including an introduction and an ending! Parts of the story were vague."
4,I liked the book The Giver.,"I thought tha book The Giver was a good book. It was interesting to thinkabout our community and how much better it is than Jona's. In tha book The Giver, Jonas lived in a community where everything was the same.They can't see color or pick their own jobs. Communities today are a lot different. The ending was a lot better than the beggining because Jonas could die and second. Every move he makes counts. The beginning just explained what his community was like and it got boring after a while."
3,Not for pre-teens,"I was asked to read this book because it was assigned to 5th grade students. I must admit I had a variety of feelings concerning book as I read through the pages. My first reaction was of concern for the life style and some of the situations described. As I read further, I began to see some real value to the story and actually did enjoy the book. However, I do have concerns about this book being assigned to children younger than in the 7th or 8th grade. There is alot in this book which I think would be better for older children to read and discuss....not 11 year olds. Parents, if your child is asked to read this book or wants to read it on his/her own, I highly suggest that you read it first. If you think it is appropriate for your child, please take the time for discussion afterwards. This is not a light-hearted book....."
2,The Giver,"The Giver may have won the Newberry Book Award, but there are acouple of places in the book that didn't make sense, such as the ending. What happened, he startes rolling down the hill then goes into a house with x-mas lights, did he die or something? What exactly happened to him?We as a class hade to read this book and are tolled to write a review at Amazon, because thats were we got the books. Many of my calss mates didn't understand the ending."
2,OK,"I thought that this book was OK. In parts of the book you would just think, ""When is this going to end?"" But then towards the end of the book it got a little better and more interesting. In this book Jonas doesnt know of any fear, pain, or war. I think I couldnt get into the book because I couldnt realate to anything. Nothing in his world was like ours."
4,One of Lois Lowry's best of all time,This book is GREAT! I didnt want to stop reading it.The suspense is unbearable. I've told all of my friends about this great book and they enjoy it too.
5,Changed my Life,"I really can't describe the impact this book left on my life. I was originally assigned to read this for my philosophy class and its been a big life changer since. The book is a quick read, and seeing its under 2 dollars used, I would say its definitely worth the time to read."
4,A Good book,"In the beginning, the book is a little hard to understand, but once you do not want to put it down. It is a great book with a good plot and it has a lot of unexpeted turns. Jonas lives in a community where everything is suposed to be perfect, but as you keep reading you find out what they are missing. The Giver is a great book with an ending that makes you want to read more."
4,"Odd, though enjoyable","Lois Lowery- I thought- had a very good writing ability and could make you see yourself like you where right in the character's shoes. Like many other books that she's written, the story tells itself well- but there's just a bit of a problem. The story itself (just in general) is really WEIRD! First of all the boy in the story where it takes place lives in this whole metropolis of people who are consistantly apologizing an speaking very good english, and are completly and totally brain-washed by the ""rules."" But also in an intresting sort of again weird way the whole entire story kind of wraps itself around the main focus of the story leaving you or the reader dazed and confused but yet at the same time, charmed and delighted."
4,the giver,"Lois Lowry's book, The Giver, is set in a utopia with no colour, music, feeling and they have no choise in what they do. They are assigned. When Jonas begins his training with The Giver, he is exposed to pain, colour, love and sadness. Jonas is not allowed to talk about his training to anyone so he must bare all of these feelings for himself. He learns the real truth about his community. Jonas can't stand to live in his community any longer and he and the Giver devise a plan. This plan could lead Jonas to his death, or lead Jonas to a life of love, colour, and possibly even pain.Steph K. 7R C.C.P.S"
3,Comment by us,"The Book ""The Giver"" plays in the future. There is a community which is ruled by a Receiver and some elders who tells the inhabitants what to do. One of these inhabitants is Jonas who is selected to take over the most important job in the community. I didn't like the book very much because I don't like such unreal stories. I think the author wrote too much unrealistic things, for example I can't understand why the community has developed into what they are in the story. Many things that are part of over our lives were abolished (also all dangers) and I can't quite understand why...Metal Rulez !!!"
3,The Giver,We live in Germany and we read this book in our English lessons.Although I thought that I wouldn`t like it because it is a story which takes place in the future it is interesting.From my point of view I can imagine the feelings of Jonas.Finally I would recommend this novel because it isn`t like each normal and predictable book!
5,If you want a book that makes you think . . .,"This book is often overlooked by adults because of its ""young adult"" label, which is too bad. I have never met anyone--adult or child--who has not been moved by this book.Lois Lowry is a master of storytelling, and this book is no exception. This is such a departure from her normal style of writing, and it is an absolutely amazing book. The idea of this ""perfect"" utopia and the restrictions placed upon its members are fodder for unbelievable conversation.I teach this novel to middle school students, and it never fails to amaze me how they respond to this novel. I recommend that this book be read and discussed by people of ALL ages. What a wonderful book for families to read together!(Be sure to check out Lowry's newest book, Gathering Blue, the long-awaited companion to The Giver!)"
3,"Interesting, but not the best.","I think this was a rather interesting book, mostly due to the fact that it takes palce in the future. I usually like futuristic stories, and out of all of them i have rea, this has to be one of the wierdest by far. First off, the settting takes place int his little town that has a bundle of rules that the whole town has to obey. The main carachter, Jonas, is assigned to the role of the reciever. He recieves memoreis from this old dude and realizes how much the community is messed up. It's a good book, and it keeps you interested in the story, though through the middle of book, it starts to get alittle boring. Good news is that is starts to get more exciting when he leaves the town. The only thing i didn't like about the book was the ending. The author left us hanging there, but i guess the point of this ending is to let the reader think of the ending."
4,Review of The Giver (VHS),Louis Lowry's the Giver is offers an extremely interesting look at a possible future in a Utopian society that is both well written and philosophically interesting. Of these positive aspects the most significant are the philosophical problems and ideas suggested by the work. Most notable of these is the balance of safety and elimination of the negative aspects of the world with the elimination of the truly beautiful and wonderful things exist as well. These along with other musings on individuality form a novel that is intellectually stimulating as well as simply enjoyable. The book is plainly written and should be easily accessible to anyone over the age of twelve or even eleven (although they may not quite grasp the full implications of the novel). I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
3,Review on The Giver,"This book ""The Giver"" was a weird but interesting book. It was mainly about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society with no feelings, inequalities, hunger, and pain. Each member of the society is given their future occupation at the age of only twelve. Jonas is very scared for his Ceremony of Twelve. He ends up becoming the reciever of memory. By working with the Giver Jonas realizes the truth about his society and what everyone is missing out on. The ending of The Giver is very interesting, it was not what i had expected to happen. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so just read the book to find out!!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet..... The Giver by Lois Lowry is the best book I have ever read. Its one of those books that make you think, and the ending leaves you feeling fulfilled. Wonderful descriptions also. I recommend everyone, young and old read this book."
5,The Giver,"The Giver is an awsome book! It has a very interesting and controversial story. I could not put this book down. It is very controversial in that it talks about the idea of abortion, comunism, and the world of sameness. If you are like me you will enjoy arguing and disscussing the meaning of this book with others who have read it. I recomend this book to all people in the 8th grade or higher because it is so controversial."
4,The Review,"This book is good to read when you are alone and in a quiet place . If our world was like Jonas's it would be great , there'd be no violence , no war ,and no pain. After you start you can't stop . If the stars could go higher I would give it 100 stars."
3,The Giver,"When I first saw The Giver's cover I didn't know what to think. When I started reading the book it wasn't all that great, but as i got into the middle of the book I had to slow down because I couldn't really understand it. To me this defenintly is not a child book! I thought the book was okay, but it's up to the reader to decide."
2,couldhave done better,"Lios Lowry's The Giver is a good book ay first, but thern as it reaches the end it loses the its touch. The book just stops you as it was getting to get better. As if you were talking to some one on the phone you are disconnected right when something important was about to be told. But it does have the effect of you gluing your eyes to the page. when your eager to find what happens next. But from all the work Ms. Lowry did on the book, I feel she could have done a little better.7.2DB"
