5,I'm in love with a ballerina,to put it bluntly this is my absolute favorite book. even though I dont have it n the kindle i still loved this book....ever since i read granny dan i have been inspired to take up ballet...
1,What a rubbish!!!,"I'd like to advise Ms. Steel to stop exploiting the Russian pre- and post-revolutionary theme. Her Zoya was close to what had really happened in Russia, but this book... I don't know, it looks like a cheap fake, even the heroine's name... There's no such Russian name like Danina (sounds more like a female surname), and Petroskova (it's something close to Bulgarian)... This whole story reminds me the biography of Anna Pavlova, the greatest Russian ballet dancer, but Danina acts and speaks like she lives on the West of nowadays. It's a pity 'cause I do enjoy Steel's books a lot, but this one... Perhaps, she needs to study better the environment she discribes."
3,Better than Most!,"Once upon a time, I read every book that Danielle Steel put out, plus saw all the movies. Over time, they all began to run together with similar themes and predictable plots. I gave this book a chance, and found it to be better than most, but still quite predictable. Towards the end, it just seemed like she wanted to get it to print, and stopped putting the effort into it. Great detail in the first few chapters, but it loses motivation. I wish she had included more historic facts into the novel. Then it really could have been a learning lesson."
4,Enjoyable reading,"Although this wasn't one of Danielle Steel's greatest works, (I actually got through this one without crying) it was an enjoyable story that held my attention until I finished it."
3,Ending is given away in early chapters,"I enjoyed the plot and time period of this book. I was upset that the ending was given away at the beginning. It kind of makes you feel hopeless and not want to finish it. I was pretty sick of Dan being 'sick'. She made a lot of DUMB choices as well as Nicolai. So, they made their bed and had to lie in it. Literally, at times it seems. I would have enjoyed the book more if the overall tone of the book wasn't so depressing."
2,Very disappointing,"I am not a romance junkie nor a regular Steel reader. I bought this book in the hopes of finding something different and exciting, a glimpse into the world of Russian ballet training, along with a tender love story. I got neither.To me this was an outline of what could have been a great book with only a few of the scenes developed.Much of the action, including Danina's entire training at the ballet, was summarized in a few narrative paragraphs.I never formed a bond with any of the characters nor could I ""feel"" for them because they never became real to me. Except for a few scenes most of the integral conversation and description that should have lead to that bond was merely reported on not shown in detail.Ms. Steel forgot the elemental rule of fiction writing, don't tell, show. Make each scene come alive with detail and conversation.It's a shame because this COULD have been a great book if it had been written correctly."
3,Dissapointing Ending,"When I began reading Granny Dan, I was captivated. It was wonderful reading about the events that happened in Danina's life and the things that happened between she and Nikolai. However, I was very disappointed at the ending. I feel Danielle Steel needed to add at least one more chapter to the book. The content of the book lifted me higher and higher, then at the end, I felt as though I was dropped. I believe there could have been a much better way to end Granny Dan."
4,A great romance,I have been reading Danielle Steel for many years and I truly enjoyed this book. It was a wonderful love story. I read the reviews and decided to read it for myself. I'm glad I did. I found it short and easy to read. Keep writing DS....you're the best!
3,Steel Steals Your Heart,"Whenever I want to relax with a book of love, hope, conquering fears....I buy Danielle Steel. Although it may be simplistic, ""Granny Dan"", is a short, sweet, provocative story.Using the backdrop of Czarist Russia allowed me to see the glitter, the gold & the powers of the rich. As well as the trials & tribulations of those held in the grip of their powers. Steele always describes so well I feel as if I am ""there"". From crystal chandeliers to peasant feasts of butter and marmalade and fresh baked breads.Not just a dancers story...a story of love for everyone.if you find my comments interesting, please click the ""yes""--thanks--CDS"
2,Disappointed Steel Fan!,"This was the worst offering I have read by Danielle Steel. I read her titles while relaxing at the beach. Read THE GIFT, FULL CIRCLE, FINE THINGS etc and loved them!GRANNY DAN did not capture nor hold my attention."
1,Danielle Steele's Latest is Bitter Pill,"Danielle Steele's latest work was obviously the result of a tight publishing schedule and too many conjunctions. I, unfortunately, heard the audio version, and I found it difficult to keep track of the many illnesses of the protagonist, who had - let me see - severe influenza, morning sickness, a bad abortion, and a banged-up foot. She was constantly in bed - either ill or with her adle-brained doctor-lover, who was stupid enough to go to Siberia to the Czar instead of running away to exotic Vermont with Granny Dan. Forgive me, Steele lovers, but this one really stunk!"
3,"I""ll look forward to another try.","I have always been a great fan of Danielle Steel's, but her last three books have been a big disappointment. This one sounded like a shorter version of Zoya. I enloyed it somewhat, but I felt like she kept going on an on and did not give the reader(me)more. The books that she wrote a while back were much better. I will try again."
3,"""A Revised, Condensed Version"" of Zoya!","I have been a Danielle Steel fan FOREVER (she has been writing that long, hasn't she?). I too believe that Ms. Steele is ""rushing"" to get the books out. I was truly disappointed in this one (although it was a ""sweet"" story) but I felt I was reading a ""condensed, revised"" version of Zoya. Has Ms. Steel run out of ideas? Are her publishers suppressing her creative abilities by rushing the deadlines and the $ signs? Publishers and Editors: Please allow Ms. Steel her creative ""room"" and let her ""breathe"" betweeen novels - I'll wait! for great stories like ""Heartbeat"", ""Jewels"", ""Changes"".... I am and remain, a Danielle Steel Fan!"
1,what a trash!,"This is without a doubt THE most borring book I've ever read. Mrs.Steele should retire from her writing career, before all her readers fell into a coma. It's sad, really."
1,Not worth the time,"I have not read a Danielle Steel in a couple of years, as I was burned out on them, and now I know why. The characters are unrealistic, the story is the same-beatiful person that everyone loves has problems. Blah, blah, blah..."
3,History comes to life.,"I was just beginning to think I was totally burnt out on Danielle Steel. I have read just about all of them. Though, in recent time, I have been disapointed. Her newiest one, Granny Dan made me think she was going to go back to adding a liitle history to her novels and that would please me. I enjoyed this story, but her chapters appeared to be repetitous. It would have made a great short story."
2,Danielle missed the mark this time,"I am an advid Danielle Steel fan and ""pre-ordered"" her new book so I could feast on it ASAP! I was in for a huge disappointment. The story is sweet but could have/should have been sold as a short story. It left me feeling cheated, having paid full price for a hardcover book that was clearly a rush job. If you feel you must read it... do yourself a favor... wait for it to hit your local library or USED bookstore"
1,Thank goodness I borrowed.....instead of bought this!!!!,"More of an outline than a real story, this very short, fluffy read is a real disappointment. She offers us nothing new with this....it actually seems as though she whipped this one out in a weekend by just thinking of the basic plot of previous books like Zoya. Very shallow, even babyish writing here, no depth, and really no interest overall, and certainly no surprises....why is it that nearly every Steel book has a heroine who is pregnant and has no clue about it? Her shorter books are her worst...although, I remain a fan of her storytelling talents......they just weren't evident in this one!"
5,Awesome Book,I absolutely loved this book. Danielle Steel put you right in the girl's shoes. You could experience everything she was experiencing first hand. Keep Kleenex handy!
5,Granny Dan is Great Read,"Granny Dan is an excellent book about a Russian Ballerina in pre-Revolution Russia. This book is shorter than most DS books, but it is an excellent read. It is very interesting and hard to put down after the first 5 pages. I highly recommend it. When you are reading this book, you forget what time it is so beware. It's hard to put down."
1,Disappointing,"I have never read anything by Danielle Steel and picked this up to see what the fuss was all about. I found it very disappointing and full of holes. Also, she repeats everything so many times that I feel she was trying to fill the pages. It's not a particularly long book as it is. If you were to take out the repetitions, it would probably go about a quarter of its length. I may one day read something else by DS, but this definitely has turned me off reading further right now."
5,A wonderful book for dancers and anyone alike,"Granny Dan is an awesome book! The way Danielle Steel describes Danina's life and story is remarkably detailed and intriguing. Anyone who has a passion for the ballet will love this book. Even if you aren't really a fan, you might still find Granny Dan to be a fantastic read. I am a dancer myself, and I flew through it. I read it in one sitting and once begun, couldn't stop until it was finished."
1,Where's the real Danielle Steel?,"I love Danielle Steel's books, at least I used to. I couldn't wait until a new one came out. Lately, I have been very disappointed in her style.Granny Dan was a very slow moving, boring book. I forced myself to read it, as I finish a book when I start one. It was hard to do so though.What happened to the Danielle Steel of a few years back? We want her back!!!I've told others not to waste their time reading this book. Hopefully Danielle will pick up her writing like she used to do. Is she trying to publish too many books, and therefore, not putting her ""all"" into them individually?Sorry Danielle, but this one is very lacking.A dissappointed fan...."
4,A really good book!,"I have read some of the customer reviews and I totally disagree with most of them. This is my first Danielle Steele book, and I think it is excellent! I thought it was sad about Nikolai and Danina, but I think that DS did a good job in portraying the emotions of the characters. I felt what the characters felt. Unfortunately I finished the book at school so I couldn't cry over it, but I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an insightful, quick read."
2,Very Disappointing!,"The rush to keep up with her tradition of putting out 2-3 books a year has definitely caught up with Ms. Steel. I'm a long-time fan, and have read almost everything she has written. I have to say I was very disappointed with ""Granny Dan"" - the story was obviously rushed and is of a much lower quality than her previous novels. I hope this isn't indicative of future books."
2,REVIEW,"This was an o.k. book. In my opinion, it was not better than ZOYA which had more detail. I was so excited when it first came out. I was somewhat disappointed when I finished it. Do not buy it. Wait and check it out at your library."
1,A Grave Disappointment,I was very disappointed with Granny Dan as I have with the last few books by Danielle Steele. I haven't read a good one from her in years. Maybe it's the assistants that she is relying on or maybe she is just trying to chrun them out too fast but I'm one reader who doesn't think she'll be going back to Steele again. Sorry to say that a master has fallen.
1,awful,"I decided to try reading a D.S. book simply because she's a big name and has bestsellers. What an awful book for me to start out with. Danina wasn't an interesting character in the least. The male character, the doctor whose name I can't remember because I couldn't find it in my heart to even finish the book, completely took advantage of Danina. I believe the doctor was about 38 years old and Danina was about 18 (?). It's been some time since I've read this book, about a year and a half, so I might be a few years off with the age difference, but I remember it being close to 20 years. I found the age difference repulsive, but also the book was very slow. I don't recommend this book at all. I have heard that some of her older books are good reads so I'm going to try them instead."
1,not worth reading,DS is losing her touch. I have been and avid reader of DS books but since THE KLONE I have not been motivated to go out and get her books. She needs to find another career.
2,Dissapointed,"Again, after reading all of Danielle Steels books and 2 in the last month, the Klone and Granny Dan,( I did not like either of them) I also beleive she is loosing her writing skills. I am sorry I jumped the gun and bought Granny Dan in hardcover. I have kept most of her books but these 2 may make it to the garage sale."
3,A Sweet Tale of Love,Even with that lovely little how-we-met plot it's terribly predictable and abruptly short. She just sped through the ending! This could have been another hit bestseller if it weren't for that.
3,MCO-14,"Contrary to one of the reviews, this book does _not_ give every possible move for various openings; prior editions never have. I obviously use it as a reference source, and the little that I have read is irritating due to the typos. Page 504, column 4 of the Albin Counter Gambit gives 4.Nf3Nf3. It is impossible for two pieces to occupy the same square at the same time; Black's move should have read 4...Nc6. On the same page, footnote (f) has move 11. as""Fr2"" There is no piece that begins with ""F"" and there's no square designated ""r2."" The proofreader must have been alseep or nonexistent before that page was printed. I certainly hope the rest of the book doesn't contain similar typos. If it does, then the book will be discarded and NCO purchased."
2,Over-rated and Outdated,"A good book if you want a lot of superficial variations and lines to play that have a good chance of being outdated or maybe even busted. 30 or 40 years ago, during this books halcyon days, this type of compendium info was a blessing, but with the advent of on-line databases and PC databases, this book has become a dinosaur and is destined to become somebody's doorstop on a blustery day.The book's real value may be only for stronger players (2200+) to see what outdated and recommended (but now busted) lines some unlucky sap will play into so as to be led nose-first into the slaughter-room."
5,Wait a little and get the 15th edition,"This is a great book, the definitive source of chess openings. Wait for a bit before you buy this book though, because there is a 15th edition coming out soon, and its supposedly got a lot more to it than this one does."
4,Great reference at a great price!,"If you can't afford a GM's library, then this one book openings encyclopedia is a must for you. Nick de Firmian is excellent as always. I still have the Batsford Chess Openings Volume 2 that he wrote with Kasparov and I must say that de Firmian knows what he is talking about. Alas, this will give you a basic understanding of most openings, and might get to some dept in others, but don't expect it ro substitute your own study and analysis. Still, I highly recommended as it contains a wealth of chess openings information."
3,A huge list of variations printed on yellow paper,"This book is a huge list of variations, with very little text. This is obviously for the serious competitive player only. Sadly, they still print these on ""yellow"" paper - hard to read and looks old from day one. The font is a bit small.This is 2009, and serious players use computers and chess databases to study and to stay current on opening theory. Combining a chess engine with a chess database and database software is the best thing that happened to chess players in recent years.In my opinion, this and similar books have been made obsolete by current software and databases. However, as a compendium of variations, this book is as fine as any."
3,Nice,"Great book for know all the opning variations out there. But if you can get yourself chessmaster or fritz, then you dont need this book."
3,Component shelf wall mount with fixed position,"The product went up easily and supports the components. It would have been handy if the direction the component faces could be altered, even if just 15-20 degrees to accomodate a corner install that faces out near the center of the room."
4,Solid!,"Nice product, great price. Does not come with a flat shelf, I'd recommend buying a small glass or metal shelft so your cable box or components are completely flat."
5,FIT MY NEEDS PERFECTLY,"Wall mounts for CRT TV's are almost impossible to find. This mount is sturdy, easy to install, reasonably priced, arrived on time and in perfect condition."
4,Good product,"This is a nice product. In my case, however, after installing it, it ended up crooked, but it's because I installed the base a bit crooked to one side without noticing it. My only observation is about the 2 tiny screws that actually support the ""V"" holding the apparatus to the base. They don't have a head and therefore they can easily be screwed through the whole. For the one on top, it doesn't actually go through a hole in the base, so what it does is to press it. Not sure how firm and for how long it can keep it sturdy, but there they are holding my JVC receiver, which is quite bulky."
3,Sanus Systems VMAVB Component Shelf Wall Mount,"We ordered this to hold a satellite box below a new flat screen tv in our bedroom. It had to be mounted in the corner and there was no way to do it with the hardware included. My husband had to manufacture a V-shaped piece out of wood, paint it black & then use it as a bracket to attach the mount to the wall. Works great & looks great but... it would be better if a corner-mount option could be included in the hardware pkg."
3,"Good, but few flaws...","The installation was not that hard, but few things did not go well. The material quality is good, but the small locking screws are not. The support that needs to be attached to the bracket is not leveled and CANNOT be leveled at all. It tilts to the right and there was no way to get it leveled. Only way is to move the bracket taking it out of level. If you have only one that would be the solution, but if you have more than one they go out of alignment when try to level the support arm. So the brackets are perfectly aligned and leveled, but the support arms. The manufacturer must look into this and correct it. Also include the locking screws made of stronger material. The cable management is not good either. Too tight and the cover does not stay in place when few cables/cords run through it.Besides those issues once installed it looks great."
4,Acceptable product; poor instructions,"This product does everything it is supposed to do, and it is inexpensive and sturdy. Unfortunately the instructions that accompany it are WRONG. The pilot holes that must be drilled for the included lag bolts are misidentified as 1/4"" in diameter. DO NOT DRILL 1/4"" HOLES FOR THE LAG BOLTS! The correct diameter is 3/16 inches or less. If you drill 1/4"" holes the lag bolts will NOT grip. The outside diameter of the threads of the lag bolts are around 1/4""."
4,Cheap and Works Well,These are great mounts that are cheap and strong. I actually used 159lb drywall anchors to hold up my AV components and they held up well. The only beef I can say is that the predrilled holes are to close to the center of the bracket. there are 4 of them and are almost in a straight line vertically down the center. Well it makes it a bit floppy when installed like that. I went ahead and drilled my own that were spaced near the sides so there are no horizontal movement. Worked like a charm. If you want a good solution to your mounting needs then you will be happy with these mounts.
5,Good book,I always buy these books because they make my life easier. Just do some adjustments and customization and you have a good working presentation.
1,very bad game,moderately good at first but gets boring in a few hours. Very disappointing!!! A disgrace to the makers of the game!
5,A Great Gift for Yourself in this busy world,"I bought this book 2 years ago, as a reward for myself. It's so beautiful and tranquil that reminded me of the simpler time is really what I want."
2,Poor imitation of the originals,"This is a fairly cynical effort by a publisher trying to wring every last penny out of the creation of a deceased author. Although the book cover says in prominent lettering, ""Margaret and H.A. Rey"", do not be fooled. They had nothing to do with this. Rather, every story is ""in the style of"" Margaret and H.A. Rey. It's pretty obvious the stories were churned out as quickly as possible, as they all have basically the same plot, same resolution. Do a little research, get the original Curious George books by the Reys, and you'll be much happier."
4,A favorite,"The book is a favorite in our household. We read it several times a day. We read the words, search for Curious George when he's hiding and look at the pictures. It is has provided hours of fun with many more to come."
4,The child's opinion counts the most!,"First, I must admit that I was never a Curious George fan as a child. I remember the other children taking the books from the library -- they loved them -- but I just didn't see what was so great.When my daughter was born, a friend of ours bought this book as a present. I didn't read it to her until she was about 2, and that was only at her request. She is now 4 and she still loves the stories, and believe it or not, they've grown on me.Many people have complained that these stories and illustrations are not the originals, but that's just fine with me. It didn't take away from my daughter's enjoyment either.If you are an avid fan of the original Curious George, this may not be for you; however, I enjoy it and think the stories are perfect for bedtime. And, it's not like my opinion counts the most -- my daughter's does -- and she is asking for more books like this one!"
2,Odd for iPad,"While my 3 year old son doesn't notice, the choice you have to use this on an iPad is to pick from reading the text or to have the picture big enough to notice the details, because you can't do both without constantly having to zoom in and out. Overall, if I had known it was this complicated, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Not a well made ebook,"As another reviewer noted, this is a poorly laid out ebook - just scans of the pages (including the text) with the text added again below them. It's painful. Kid's books have a lot of potential on color devices like the fire, but weak attempts like this are not worth the download."
5,A Treasury of Curious George,"This book is so great! I loved reading Curious George when I was little, and although it's been such a long time since I've even seen any of these books, I instantly remembered some of the stories when I read them to the kids that I babysit!"
2,Charmless,"Despite the cover, this book is NOT by H.A. and Margret Rey.In fact, the publisher has so little respect for the product that they do not credit the author and, for several of the storys, credit the illustrations to an interactive company rather than a person. (A company, which has not updated it's web site in 10 years!)Very dissapointing."
5,"""Don't Monkey Around.......This Is a Great Read!""","For those who may not know it, Curious George has been around for 60 years, delighting his audience of children and adults, those of us who grew up reading about him and his adventures. You will crack up as you read about George's adventures and how the man in the yellow hat is always there to help him.You will ""go bananas"" as you read through this collection of H. A. Rey stories that take you on delightful adventures, and maybe think of your own adventures.The author, H. A. Rey, not only served in the military, but he and his wife hid out in Paris, and escaped ""with his collection of Curious George stories"". Little did he know that these stories would be around for several generations to read and enjoy and to pass them on to their children, grandchildren, and then some.This is a 2004 edition of H. A. Rey's writings depicting the stories about George and the Man in the Yellow Hat. Read it, and you ""will laugh your sides out""."
5,ELITENESS,"THIS ALBUM OWNS ITS SO OLD SCHOOL, WITH SILLY STYLES THAT JUST CAME OUT U LIKE MAD CRAZY. IF U WANNA LAUGH AND LISTEN TO SOME DOPE ** MUSIC BUY THIS ALBUM ITS ELITE"
4,wonderful,"Lovely CD, only problem is the artists all thought they had to do their own prayer cycle, so each piece rises in volumne and crescendo. Not the best for sleep time, but nice for yoga and cooking time."
5,A truely incredible CD!,"Since I first heard and bought this CD, I have purchashed over 10 copies and given them as gifts. Never has music overwhelmed me and brought me to tears the way The Prayer Cycle does (and still does.) The power this CD has on one's soul is truely a religious experience. If I had to get rid of all my CD's but one, I believe that this is the one I would keep. It's that powerful! If you are a serious listener, I highly recommend you get this and give it a serious listen."
5,The voice of God speaks through this music.,"Jonathan Elias composed some of the most beautiful music ever heard and Lawrence Schwartz has arranged and orchestrated the composition to perfection. It is a musical blend of religious cultures combined to bring the pain and suffering of mankind to the attention of God. The true magnificent beauty is that, the music and arrangements are so moving, they actually build faith: in Man and God. Music that can actually rebuild our faith in mankind, give us hope for one another and ourselves is music that is a pure joy to own, to listen to and give as gifts of beauty and hope. As a composer,performing artist, pianist, I never thought it was possible for ME to be spiritually moved this much by music of any sort. Favorite track is #3 HOPE. Anyone associated with working on this project should be proud of their accomplishments and artistic contribution to the world. It is that good."
4,"worth owning for ""Benediction"" alone!!!","The track (""Benediction"") with Linda Ronstadt and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is absolutely staggering... the rest is wonderful (Perry Farrel was a pleasent surprise) but this track proves the album's musical centerpiece AND i'm not nessesarily a hard-core fan of either. Listen and respond!"
5,Exquisite.,"Beautiful. Gorgeous. Haunting. Peaceful. Wonderful.So moving, close to tears.Definitely recommended."
4,Inspirational Vocalization,I first heard the first track on this album from Alanis Morissette's compilation The Collection and what intrigued me was her vocals and the male vocals singing with her. I though it was powerful and provoking. My fiance and I have both listened to Alanis since we were younger and this particuly struck us.
5,Pure revelation...,"I am in no way an emotional person. It's just not the way I express myself. However, the first time I heard this album I literally broke down and wept like a child. All of the tracks are a pure revelation to me of the power of music as well as a testament to the purity and spirit of the human voice."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"I discovered this CD by accident. I was looking for music by Salif Keita and found ""The Prayer Cycle."" Jonathan Elias has created a masterpiece that moves the soul. Given these troubled times, I often find myself in tears as I listen to the prayers offered by these vocalists in their many languages."
5,"If you don't cry listening to this CD, I'll eat it!!","I've given about five copies of this CD to various friends and everyone has cried hearing it. I may not be a classical music fan, but I think that The Prayer Cycle is one of the most incredible compositions I've ever heard, rivaling the great classical composers (apologies to those for whom that is blasphemy!!!) The music is deeply spiritual, indeed religious in both sound and lyrics, and cuts across every faith to the beliefs that join us all. Buy a few copies at once and save shipping costs later, as you will surely want to give this to a friend!!"
4,A great CD for background music or for focused listening!,"I am constantly seeking music that is good for concentrated personal listening (when I really want to think about what I'm listening to), or for light background music when I'm studying, working, or eating. The Prayer Cycle is perfect for both. The beautiful orchestration and fresh vocals aren't too overpowering or too weak. At the very least, the entire CD is worth the two minutes that James Taylor sings. Nothing to lose, lots to gain with this CD."
5,If Paradise Had a Soundtrack...,"It would be this CD. I bought it on a whim after hearing excerps on another site and following the link. I was not prepared for what was in store.This music, so stirring and powerful, is a heady mixture of the sacred and the surreal. From Alanis's heart-wrenching, plaintive vocals to the ethereal tones of Linda Rondstadt and the American Boychoir, ""The Prayer Cycle"" carries the soul to places normally accessible only in dreams."
5,Moving,"What an amazing album. I really applaud artists and record companies who take a chance on music that isn't socially ""the norm.""These tracks are incredibly moving and emotional. The album is sung in many different languages but the message is united through classical music with a touch of world beats and a haunting religious hint.James Taylor has an absolutely heart-tugging song that nearly brings me to tears every time I hear it and Alanis' voice is perfection as usual.If you enjoy good movie soundtracks and/or Zen-esque music, this album is definitely for you."
5,Great design and a bit useful.,"This watch as I said, has an excellent design. The size is enough, not too big, not too small.And for a soccer fan like me it's handy when timing the first and second half.However, when I got the item, there was no instructions in the box, I had to look for them at Fossil web page, and even so, they're a little bit confusing."
5,Great for medium and small wrists. Fashionable and purposeful,Bought this at an Outlet Mall and was more expensive than it is here on Amazon! Great looking watch. Not too heavy compared to other chronographs. The bezel does not turn for those who are wondering. The chronograph second hand is red and the face looks like carbon fiber. It's a simple and elegant design that goes with many wardrobes. I've been a Fossil fan for over 12 years. My first Fossil is still running.I have small wrists (I'm not big-boned) and this watch fits very well.
4,Very Informative,This is a great book full of ideas and information for anybody new to pro-touring. It is not a step-by-step guide to building a car if that's what you're looking for. It presents the general concept of pro-touring with many specific examples. The source guide at the end of the book is probably worth the purchase price on its own.
2,"Too many bugs, poor construction and not cost efffective","Our site uses several temperature and humidity loggers and this is model has been the least reliable. Every unit has simply stopped working and had temperature current, high and low as well as humidity current high and low all stuck on the same readings regardless of battery changes or clearing. Other units have had the displays fail either partially or completely. The chief user complaint is the buttons frequently become caught under the unit housing when resetting the high and low readings. Combine that with paying over half of the purchase price for annual recalibration and you have a less than cost effective result."
5,Not as casual as most on the topic,"Drs. William Young and Stephen Silberstein's Migraine And Other Headaches is not as casual as most on the topic: it provides a medically-based analysis of the causes of different types of headaches, defines different migraine experiences, and differentiates between severe headache, tension headache, and migraine. While the reading in Migraine And Other Headaches isn't as easy as some self-help guides on the topic, the focus on uncovering the source of symptoms and various treatment options makes this medical handbook an excellent guide for sufferers seeking better care or more information."
1,Worst Customer Service -- EVER!,"Great shirt, but DON'T buy it from Rock-Rebel Clothing. They have the absolute WORST customer service.I have ordered from them twice before and all seemed good. That is until I needed to send an item back for exchange. 2 MONTHS later and I still do not have my exchange item.It's a miracle if you get a reply to e-mail and even when they do, they do not follow up with you - or - you just get a standard form reply. NO phone number either for service on existing orders.I now have my credit card company involved in an effort to get this resolved.BOTTOM LINE -- DO NOT DEAL with this vendor."
3,Scruples Enforce Sculpting Glaze,"I ordered this product to replace a similar one for my wife. The product works great but the dispenser is broken and it appears that the bottle may have been opened before shipping. Regardless, my wife is satisfied with the results it gives."
5,scruples,I love this product.I put it on my hair while it is damp and it gives my hair body for the whole day.Delivery was very fast too...
4,great collection,"This collection focuses more on Clarke's early 70's recordings than other greatest hit collections, though with dub mixes on a few of these tracks. The collection is well thought out retrospective on formative youth.While no one track is an immediate standout, all are excellently made and nicely showcase Clarke's wonderful tenor voice.Well worth the wait and the price, this cd is a great collection."
2,Great Idea HORRIBLE EXECUTION!!!!!!!!!,Originally bought this for the version of Baby Talk by The Laurels as its currently the only CD out there that has it. Most of the tracks tho are somewhat forgettable bits of Doo Wop nothing bad necessarily but nothing too special. My huge issue was in the execution of the CD. The track list on the back is written in such laughably tiny print is unreadable and no where on the CD are the artist listed just the song titles. For the music itself its great but the artwork is probably the worst ive ever seen.
2,Heavily flawed and overpriced,"This chair is initially comfortable when you sit it in for short periods. However, it does not stand up to extended sitting. It has multiple flaws that should not exist in an $800 chair.#1) While the mesh seat is comfortable towards the back of the seat, there is a support beam underneath it in the front that prevents it from flexing. This puts pressure on your hamstrings, which becomes very uncomfortable after a few hours.#2) The arm pads are as hard as a rock.#3) There is a plastic seam on the edge of the seat that scratches your legs when you turn.#4) The back is not very flexible.#5) It is constructed with a large amount of plastic.#6) There is no way to lock the arm pads in place.Try sitting in one for a few hours before you buy one. Do not base your judgement on sitting in it for a few minutes."
1,Misleading Add,"This product from Backstore advertises it is the ""fully loaded"" Herman Miller Mirra chair, but as you scroll down to product description, it is in fact the ""highly adjustable"" model. There is a difference. Presumably this has no tilt and thus is not ""fully loaded""."
3,Only 1 gripe I have!!,"I was not informed from the seller when this product was to arrive at my home and it showed up late to my door. Other than that, AWESOME CHAIR!!"
2,Looks Good but it Isn't,"This plastic back chair may look good and have a few adjustments but the synchronized mechanism offers little support for women who want back support. The seat pan on this chair has hard edges and it is similiar to its sister chair the Aeron. Both have been known to cause deep vein thrombosis in some of the clients we have provided ergononic assistance for. Think about it, a plastic back chair with minimal seat depth adjustment and an open hip adjustment that makes you want to sit away from the back of the chair with no real lumbar support can hardly help you begin a good foundation for support with your lower extremities. If you want support don't chose this chair its horrible and we recommend against the purchase of them along with the Aeron 9/10 times."
3,Be careful about exceeding the weight limit,"If you exceed the 300 lb weight limit, these chairs have a defect that causes them lock down when you sit down, and spring up when you stand up. Google for ""Paul vs Herman Miller Mirra Chair"" or see this YouTube link for a video: [...]"
1,Big Yawn,"Not Wilkinson's best work, which is not saying much. My fourth grade history book was more entertaining than this ponderous bore."
2,Pretty slow,"Wilkinson can write a very entertaining novel. ""Not Between Brothers"" was really good, right in there with ""Lonesome Dove"". Oblivions Alter is really ponderous. I kept thinking it would get better but never happened. Now, if you are interested in this period's history, I would recommend it. It is well written for what it is. Entertainment it is not."
5,WOW!,"Oblivion's Altar is an amazing true tale of the Cherokee's struggle for land, their strength and their courage. it is a history you have not read before. The men and women depicted come alive and you feel their pride and their exasperation dealing with courts and government. The perspective of the book is not one-sided nor judgmental. It is an excellent read for anyone -- history buffs, readers interested in native american culture or ordinary avid readers like myself. It is a book you won't put down."
5,Excellent book,This book is one of the most exciting novels I have ever read. The action scenes in the book are as good as in a movie. Mr. Wilkinson has out done himself with this spectacular novel. Both the research and in-depth storyline are stunning. I hope that he produces another book like this because i will be the first one to buyit!
5,A Must read for New and Experienced Riders,"I am a new rider and my skills improved dramatically with each chapter. This book is an easy and quick read. In fact, its totally engaging.Nick shares his years of experience and demonstrates that safety and speed are not mutually exclusive. By taking his advice to heart, one can learn to feel the relationship that must exist between the rider, the machine and the pavement. Once understood and practiced, you'll be carving up the road as quickly and safely as possible. What a thrill!Experienced riders will appreciate that each chapter ends with a ""Lesson's from the Racetrack"" section. So the tips and/or refresers make this book a must read for any rider, in my humble opinion.If nothing else, its worth the price for the incredible photos. Enjoy and I'll see you on the coast. :-)"
2,Unsatisfating,"i dun reccomand this book to any rookie or begginner who wish to reach their knees to ther tarmac,the book simply dont show how,its quite a disappointed n limited book.It doesnt satisfated what the basic rider wants,how to corner the proper way.There's still many much to be said,like arms position,where u laid yr footpeg,the position of it and throttle control.Disappointing for me..yet again for experince rider,might understand more but dun reccomand buying."
4,A MUST READ FOR ALL STREET RIDER,"Nick Ienatsch makes it easy for anyone to read Sport Riding Techniques.The riding techniques and side stories he discribes are easy to Imagine,and even easer to practice due to the bounty of crystal clear photos available in this book(manual)."
5,Good overall,"Its a good book, well written with lots of illustrations. It does exactly what it says on the tin, its a good description of sports riding techniques."
5,Will make anyone a better rider,"Being a motocross rider for the last 35 years, I thought I would have no problems when I decided to become a street rider also. Even though I felt comfortable right away on my new road bike, after reading Nick's book it all clicked..! I now ride safer, more in control, and when it comes time to tear up the twisties, I'm having more fun on my bike than I could have imagined..! Thanks Nick, great book."
4,Beginner's bible for the newbie motorcycle rider.,"This is a newbie book. Do not expect any intermediate or advanced tips. With that being said it does reinforce what I have preached but morons have contradicted. Use the rear break, stupid! No listen to me becuase I am faster then I have brains and crash all the time so I must be fast. I am stupid and you grab a fist full of brake and endo like a total loser like I did. Don't ride with idiots in the canyons. Pushing the limits in the canyons does not make you faster it makes you crash. Guys that crash every four months are not fast, only ignorant. This should be in the driver test handbook for all the lemmings following the morons knee draging off the cliffs to the morgue ""every"" weekend. Get lessons (from pro's not morons) and take it to the track."
4,great,"This is a great book. The high quality of the presentation, including paper, binding, photos and organization make for an excellent coffee table browser. However, the real value is in the succinctly written nuggets of sport riding wisdom. If you're fairly new to motorcycles as I was when I picked this up, then I strongly recommend it. Start with a quick cover to cover read to get the general idea. Then go back and re-read each section very carefully, with a couple of rides in between to practice and understand everything explained. I feel that I improved significantly and that others in a similar situation will too."
1,don't risk your health,I really wanted this to work. In fact I took it faithfully for 2 years waiting for it to work. Unfortunately it never took my BP down at all. In fact I wound up in the hospital with a blood pressure of 300/120. Let's just say I'm on 5 blood pressure meds now and I promised my doctor I'd throw this stuff out.I'm not saying this won't work on some people. I imagine it does. But if you're having hypertensive numbers consistently consult your doctor and take care of yourself.
5,Excellent book and accurate,"I am pleased with this book since it accurately shows the person of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet as well as his solid Gospel position. He preached about the Bible, sin, repentance, and a godly life. We should continue doing the same with Deaf worldwide. This is a very good book. I quote from it often as I lead the worldwide International Partnership Ministries Deaf Ministries Department."
5,One of a kind,"The scope of this work is similar to Manly & Rickert's Texts of the Canterbury Tales. Likewise, it is the most extensive and almost solitary work of its kind in late medieval english. If one can afford it, it is a superb research tool, if only a springboard into further discussions of linguistic patterns in medieval manuscripts and incunables. The work is figuratively and physically heavy, large, and expansive."
5,Best Show Ever!,"My favorite anime series... The Slayers! This show is packed with adventure and jokes. This movie contains few swear words and a few unnessesary jokes. Otherwise the theme is great. This video has great characters like Lina Inverse, Gourry Gabriev, and Zelgadis Greyworth. The episode's plot revolves around these three friends and there mission to protect a valuable artifact. In the movie the three friends must destroy a extremely powerful challenger named Dark Lord Shabernigdo. With Gourry's Sword of Light this should be no problem... right? I absolutly think you should buy this movie, and if you can't rent it!"
5,Lina dosen't wanna battle?,"After finding out that Gourry has the Sword of Light,and Radous and Zolf start being on Lina's side,her life could not be better. Or could it get worse? Rezo the Red Priest finally manages to get the Oralcion Statue from Lina, the dark lord is finally relased. But after the dark lord took out some people Lina is shocked. Now her life can't be any worse, but it does, some people die. And Lina won't battle anymore! Will they be able to convince Lina to battle? Get The Slayers 3!"
1,Don't be misled by the title,"Although it is technically legal to do so, I have a real problem with a publisher that would change the name of their book to the same name as another better written book simply to increase their own sales. This book used to be named Rookie Coaches Football Guide.Coaching youth sports is an incredible responibility to a well intentioned coach. Any good youth coach understands that the youth players well-being comes before winning at any cost. At the same time, not giving the youth player instruction on how to properly play the game should be criminal. The key is finding the balance between adequate instruction and inspiring the player to learn and enjoy the game.If you want the book that will give you all the tools you need to coach a youth football team, buy the original book with this name, Coaching Youth Football by John T. Reed. A far superior book designed for the youth coach, that is also available through Amazon."
3,Memories of childhood,"My mother took me to see this movie when I was a child. It did not disappoint me seeing it so many decades later.I enjoyed it and will watch it again. I think this is the last movie that Jeanette Macdonald made, so for her fans it will be a special treat."
4,"""Bait and Switch"" 6"" Triangle ONLY!","Buyer beware! the RT6006 is a 6"" triangle and striker without the Trigger Mount. An RT6006 is a 5"" triangle WITH the trigger mount not available from Amazon but through third party vendors. The 6"" triangle is a good standard triangle and the rubber handle striker is nice, but I wanted the trigger mount to make control of sound and mute easier. To do this in the traditional manner you have to suspend the string between your thumb and index finger and try to grab the triangle with your pinky and/or ring finger while trying to keep the triangle from spinning out of reach. Unfortunately Amazon tends to post deceptive pictures even though the description is correct. My fault for not reading more carefully but Amazon's fault for a classic example of ""Bait and Switch"""
5,Love this game!,"I purchased this game and it is the most fun board game I've ever played! I'm 11 and I play it with so many different ages of kids. Some are older than me and some are only 7! This game teaches you all about neopets and also allowing competition between all players. Sometimes we won't have a money amount that we play to. We play until our friends have to leave. We have played this game for 4 hours straight! Although setup is a little long and the directions a little confusing, it only took about 2 min. to learn. This game is worth your time and money. It is especially great for neopets lovers like me! <3"
5,The best game ever!,"Though complicated at first, this truly is a fun game! It's really fun!To enjoy the game more, you should know what Neopets is.Again it was fun!!!!P.S.: My Neopets screenname is shoyrufan999 ! NeoMail me some time!!"
5,Coolio!,"This game is sooooo cool! Very handy for off-internet boring hours! Neopets is a website, and you can join! Best of all, it's free!"
5,The Best game,this game is soooo cool! I absolutly love neopets! to join neopets(thats what this game is about) go to http://www.neopets.com/refer.phtml?username=dckydoo and i get credit 4 reffering you and best of all its free and i love that board game!
5,a 13 year old neopets lover!,"o my gosh, this is one of the best games ever! You don't even have to know stuff about neopets to play but if u do its great! The game changes all the time cuz u don't have to go a sertin way on the game board! I love it and my Dad loves it even-though he knows nothing about neopets! if ur ever on neopets, look me up: ilovetaylor1513"
5,The Most Awesome Game Ever!,"Neopets are one of my favorite things so I bought this game because I thought it would be fun. And, when I played it, it was the best game that I ever played! It has many adventures that a kid would enjoy. It's easy to play for kids. Even my 5 year old brothers enjoyed it. I'm going to tell all of my friends about it. It's soooooooooo fun!"
2,Fizzles in stupid plot,Starts promising but by the end it becomes insultingly stupid. Not worth dedicated 1.5 hour but ok to practice guitar to.
3,Randy goes commercial (or tries),"Randy Stonehill / Get me out of Hollywood (Solid Rock CD): Randy is known as a ""Christian Rock"" artist and his heart shines through his music in that format (but not in this one). This album was Randy trying to reach the secular market and it falls flat. There are some good songs here but it is ultimately an unsatisfying effort.Three Stars."
5,Stick to surfing.,Not bad for a guy who paints himself gold an takes unneccisary amounts of clothes off in public spaces.
2,Fairly awful...,"This just isn't a very good CD. Neither of the bands are bad, and the Useless ID side is listenable, but most of the Ataris songs are way too short (around 30 seconds) or way too crappy (the band admits in the liner notes that these are the tracks they decided to leave off of their last album). But, in my opinion, the main problem is that these two bands sound almost exactly like a hundred others. Usually I don't mind The Ataris' generic sound because their music is pretty good, but that's not the case on this disc. Anyway, despite what some would have you believe, neither band (even on their best day) is half as good as the Swingin' Utters."
2,Not a great cd,Broken hearts blue skys is so much better than this. I can only imagine how bad thier next album is going to be.
4,"Good, but no Blue Skis, Broken hearts","This cd is very good, but definately not as good as broken hearts namely because of the amount of music on the cd. But get it nonetheless a good solid ataris cd."
5,No more birds,"It took me a while to read through all the information and figure out the Greek, but after applying this to my outdoor light fixture I have had no birds nesting there anymore. No complaints here."
3,Not Quite Right,It worked part of the time and often the birds alighted and did not seem bothered. So it was so-so.
4,Almost as good as the real thing.,"It is always ready when you are, and lasts longer than you can. Almost better than a man."
3,sexy but a little soft,"maybe i should buy another tyoe of dildo, because this one feels not so hard as i thought.in addition, there is always a smell which makes me a little uncomfortable."
4,Good,"It feels amazing, but the smell IS a little off, just smells like they used too much of whatever to make this toy"
4,"Good, but..","This is a good product, worth it if its on sale but I wouldn't pay more than $20. Its durable, has a good feel, length and width, but it smells really strongly of PVC! Don't get it if that bothers you, I left mine in a bag with some baking powder for a few days and that helped some, but not all the way."
4,Jay-Z,"This is a great single, if you excuse the fact that they didn't include ""Can I getta"" on the CD, which is one of Jay-Z's best. It is much better with explicit lyrics, because there isnt the chopiness of the song. Overall, it's a cool CD"
4,Hard Knock Life,"Hard Knock Life was the song back in 98/99 and it still bangs today. This song was as much street as it was commercial. The Hard Knock Life remix was wack. The beat sounded like some R&B rubbish and didn't appeal to me at all. Jay should have let someone like DJ Premier remix it for him. The Money Cash Hoes Remix I have to say though is great. Jay adds his new proteges Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel on this one. Beans even outshines Jigga himself on this one. The only downside is that DMX didn't have a verse. Now he's only on the hook. Overall this is pretty good if you're into buying singles. If not then just buy the Hard Knock Life album and download the Money, Cash, Hoes Remix. That Hard Knock Life Remix is a waste of time. Don't even download it."
3,"Great song, bad remixes","""Hard Knock Life"" was the bomb then in 1998, and it still is now. But the remix, with its R&B-ish music, sounds like a watered-down version that they would only play on easy listening stations during the daytime. And the only good thing about the ""Money, Cash"" remix (otherwise known as ""More Money, More Cash, More..."") is Memphis Bleek's line when he says, ""No need to dress warm, I brought plenty of heat."" Otherwise, this remix shouldn't have been made. DMX isn't even in this version."
4,not bad for what i thought it would be!!!!!!!!!!,"On paul bearers video there are a lot of good matches , undertaker vs crush , a four man tag match , this video has yokozuna , macho man randy savage , lex luger , and bret hart , an overal 4 star event!"
2,Heavy rock kills the subtletiesof the Fab 4,"An interesting idea of largely stadium style hard rock 1980s and 1990s covers of the Beatles songs. The problem is that many just destroy the lighter touch that made the originals such great pop songs in the process, either being live (Cheap Trick and Heart) or just lacking in the energy of the originals despite a heavier sound (Jeff Healey and Thompson Twins).The real gem is the 1967 recording by Harry Nilsson of a song cycle based around ""You can't do that"" - evidence of his great singing and why John Lennon rated him so highly as a vocalist - a performance that is at odds with the rest of the offerings on show here."
5,An excellent example,"This book is both a martial and a literary masterpiece. It captures the true essence of the martial arts, and does so with a flow that is at once leisurely and captivating, meandering and focused. The literary style is proof positive that the author knows his subject - it flowed from an unfettered mind."
5,Good story plus history - engaging,"Many books about the martial arts are dry and boring. Lowry,through his own life story and the fictionalized history ofhis style, makes this a book not to be missed! If you are amartial artist, you will find parallels and lessons. If you areinterested in the martial arts, you will find this both agood read and an excellent introduction to the practice andhistory of martial arts. This is on my ""must read"" list!"
4,What a secret!,"Un Secret is not just a ""holocaust"" film. It is a profound journey into a man's search for his identity. In some senses it is reminiscent of the the Oedipus story. Learning who one is sometimes has a high price. In this case, it is the loss of an entire personal history (and the discovery of another)."
1,Indecipherable Dreck,"My wife and I tried to watch this movie. We consider ourselves to be open-minded when it comes to watching movies. We stopped it about mid-way through after being bored to the point of stupification with its glacially slow plotline. I know that the French have made better movies than this, because I have watched them. However, if this is an example of where their movie industry is headed, they would be better sticking with wine."
3,Interesting but Long,"A much too long film with an interesting premise, but one that has been touched on several times before in French cinema--i.e. someone uncovering, ""What really happened"" to one's family during a period of nationalistic bigotry, collaboration, and deadly religious persecution. Nonetheless, the acting is fine and the period costumes impeccable. Go for it if you're specifically interested in this historical era."
2,Product is OK,"As plainly listed in Amazon.com's main heading for this DVD player, it is not ""Top Loading."" It has a front-loading door, which is vulnerable to accidental breakage, especially with kids.Also, even at full volume, the sound is very weak. Our previous Venturer/Durabrand player's sound was much better.The picture is hard to see if the screen is not pointing directly at one's eyes. This is even a problem for shorter or taller passengers seated directly in front of it in a car. The only way to adjust it up or down is to adjust the front car seat to which it's mounted. Fortunately, we can still output the signal to our old DVD player for another passenger."
1,Review of Craig DVD Player,"I purchased at Toys R Us for $119 which included a credit towards a $20 DVD. Read the reviews after I purchased it and was concerned. I opened up and charged for 10+ hrs and then watched a movie on it and it performed well. I have watched a few other movies on it and have not had any problems ""yet"". Seems to be a hit or miss product. As of this time, I believe that mine is working the way it is supposed to."
1,Piece of CRAP,"Unfortunately, I saw this on sale at Toys R Us and bought one without checking out reviews. I gave it to my son for Christmas and charged the unit for the whole day. The player worked fine for a couple short trips in the car, probably a total playing time of 1/2-1 hour. Today my wife told me it wasn't working anymore. When I plugged in the AC adapter, the red ""charging"" light came on and within 15 minutes, the green ""full"" indicator lit. When I turned the player on, the screen flashed briefly and immediately died. When the ""full"" light comes on, if I unplug the adapter and plug it back in, the ""charging"" light comes on again for a 10-15 minute period. This kind of tells me the (unreplaceable) battery pack is shot. It could be due to the car adapter since a couple reviewers mention car adapters not working. One item of interest; the Craig website does not even list any DVD players in their products list."
1,Junk,"This is not even a toploading DVD player. The description is a lie. Not only that, but it did not work straight out of the box. Even the remote is different than the one we received. What we ordered an and what we received were two totally different things. The LCD is fried and no one at Craig (the manufacturer) could help."
1,JUNK,LESS THAT ONE STAR RATING!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS JUNK-Toys R US does not stand behind their products......DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1,Doesn't work,I got 2 of them for Christmas and one didn't work at all (dead on arrival) and the other one worked for a couple of days. I exchanged one and it was also dead on arrival. They all don't work even with the A/C adaptor (No power). Do not buy this item.
1,Do Not buy this player!!!!,Got this for my daughter just before christmas. Worked for about 1 day then the screen became scrambled. The sound works but the screen does not. This DVD player is NOT reliable. Spend you money elsewhere!!!
2,Bought two for Christmas -- one worked one did not.,"We bought two. One for my son and one for my daughter for Christmas morning. I too- charged both as the directions stated so they would be ready Christmas morning. They neither one worked Christmas morning. I read the directions closer and realized that they needed to be charged up to five times and completely discharged up to five times before they would fully hold a charge. So almost a month later of fully discharging and charging, my son's will hold a charge, but my daughter's still will not hold a charge. I am also very disappointed at the carrying bag that is sold with this. I thought it was a bag. It is not. It is just a case that you put the DVD player into to strap it to the back of the car seat. It does not hold any of the accessories or any extra dvd's. If I had it to do over, I would not purchase this product."
3,Craig DVD PLayer,"I am 14, and i recieved one of these dvd players for christmas. the first time i opened it, i pluggeed it in and watched Matrix Revolutions, a 3 hour movie. the next day, i did the smae thing, but the screen is black. I looked at the maual, and realized there was a screen on/off button. Every button on the remote works, but when i aim the remote at the recepticle, and press this button, nothing happens. this was very frustrating, and i was displeased with the item. i hope i can return it."
1,School book,I bought this book thinking it was the one I needed for my class. The lister listed the isbn as the one I needed. Sadly it was not the book and the sender would not let me return it.
5,It's Not As Simple As It Seems,"The authors make a solid point that you can overdo a simple swing key, and create more complications that are counterproductive. It gives you more to think about than what may seem to be a simple caveat. Example: Instead of keeping your head still, a better key is to avoid excessive head movement. If you don't have some natural movement in the backswing, you get a reverse pivot by trying to keep the head still. You can try to keep it simple, but it's not quite that simple."
2,"All about hype, less about being good.","To be honest I don't really understand why the ECMAs gave this record so much attention in comparison to such stellar must-own albums like ""You Are What You Love"" by Melanie Doane. ""Davnet"" is folk-pop dribble with so many snoozers on it it's not really worth the selling price. ""Another California Song"" and ""Traffic"" are probably the only two songs with potential mass appeal while most of the record is acoustic ballads or midtempo attempts at songwriting which fail to develop to their full potential. If you like the ""hit"" singles you might like the record, but I only slightly liked them and they are the only songs which I can listen to on this record without skipping to the next track half way through. This record is all about East Coast hype and not about actually being good. Seriously, if you're looking for smart pop, check out Melanie Doane. She always delivers and unfortunately rarely gets the hype."
4,A Pleasant Scent In A Compact Package,"Old Spice is a pleasant scent, although there are more contemporary colognes that I prefer, like ""Realm"" and ""Altitude."" This is a good choice for travelers, though, as the bottle is small and is long-lasting. I keep this in my travel bag as it takes up almost no room, lasts quite a while, and is offered at a bargain basement price. Smelling good on the go never was so easy or cheap!"
3,This should be for older kids,"My 3 year old loved this motorcycle before he had an accident on it. My son had alot of fun riding around the park on it and in our back yard until he was riding around the patio into the grass and it flipped over on him breaking his right elbow,he does not ride this anymore even though he had a great time on it while it lasted."
5,Great Motorcycle,My son got this motorcycle for Christmas when he was 2. He loves it. He has no problems steering the bike. He has a powered quad and would rather ride the Harley. Well worth the money!
4,I'm being a bit generous.,"I give this 4 stars because I can easily imagine someone will like it more than I did - there is music here, and if you don't particularly like the music (me), then the package becomes much less attractive. I have been a junkie of binaural entrainment CD's - I just like to see what people have done - and for me, the music here is counterproductive. It is, for me, too lively for deep meditation. There are places where it slips into more trance-like places (*****), but it doesn't stay there."
2,"Not bad, startling sounds during meditation though","I'm surprised these producers don't realize when you're relaxed and in a meditative state, sudden changes in sound will startle you. This happens even in some of Kelly Howells other cds. That long pause of reflection in silence, is broken and makes you JUMP. There are definitely a few of those in here. Cosmic Rain -track 3 (Open Higher Consciousness) has some sound effect of water dripping in an echoing cave. It doesn't start until maybe 12 mins in. The waves of music are broken by these crisp semi-loud drops that, to me, don't need to be there. It makes me jump EVERY TIME. I want to skip tracks like these all together.I don't have enough of a 'higher consciousness' opening during or after the use of these tracks to make them worth it. Its just the same calming frequencies from other CDs from her. Go for a guided meditation instead and skip this one. I would have given it 3 stars, but those startle factors really knocked it down."
2,Something to go to sleep with...,"This was a nice set of relaxful Cd's, I have some quite similiar. I think the Best of Kelly Howell is given in her Cd called ""Mediation 2"" however. I haven't quit listening to it since I recieved it, 4 months ago. THAT ONE is a Must!!I might go back to this one sometime but it's defiantly not one of fav's..."
2,Not a Scriabinist,"Although well played in general, this recording is flawed to the point that I would not recommend it. The main fault lies in Long's often times hard-edged, rhythmically unimaginative approach, which deadens the character and saps the poetry out of most selections. We know that a hard and inflexible approach is what Scriabin himself most abhorred in performances of his works. I get the impression that Long is not in touch with Scriabin's highly individual, mystical sound-universe. The approach is altogether too straightforward and prosaic, although not lacking in liveliness and drive. In addition, there are actual rhythmical and notational misreadings: for example, in op. 3 no.7 ms.66 or op.3 no.9 ms.30. Why save a little more with this Naxos release when Long largely misses the point and other versions (Le Van, Feinberg, Pizarro) manage to bring out the essence, the emotional depth and mystery of these works ?"
1,Entertaining gallery of mistakes,"I just attended one of Robin Netherton's lectures about the accumulation of interpretation errors in early costume research during the Victorian years -- how one author would make a mistake, and that would be picked up by another author copying the first, and more mistakes laid on (with the best of intentions.) This book was presented as one of the most entertaining of these mistakes, because although the author used the at-the-time new photo printing technologies, she didn't use it for original sources (manuscript illustrations, etc) but for pictures of contemporary models in her interpretations of medieval clothing. The results are extremely funny. I expect similar problems with the other eras covered. I am ordering this book for its humor value and because I'm a medieval hat fanatic."
4,Love celtic music? This is a band you MUST hear!!!!,"This band is Tight! They make you want to ceile dance all night long, from track 1. The ballad ""Thounsands are Sailing"" made my husband's irish grandma weep for home.... I bought another copy for myself, she couldn't part with my first copy."
3,I know its a classic..but..,Why is it that academic types always think they are so above the mundane pleasures of lving??? What a bore!
2,Boring book,I was hoping for something classic and sensual. It was so uninteresting and a pain to get through. It dragged on. Buy something else!
4,I liked it,It certainly kept me guessing. It was very risque for it's day. It was feminism before it's time. Very strong women discovering their sexuality.
2,"Tedious, dull and inexplicably overrated",I fail to comprehend why this book has become such a 'classic'. I've never done so much skimming and speed-reading in my life. Am I missing something?
3,Attempt at Equalizing,"I think this book was Lawrence's attempt at equalizing classes, or perhaps taking the side of the working class. He tries to show that a woman of the upper class can be attracted to a man of the working class, and he probably means Clifford's paralysis to symbolize the paralysis of the ruling class. But I don't know what to make of Mellors, who didn't seem to love Constance in any way other than physically. And the ending wasn't satisfying: it seemed to just slip away. I've read this book twice: once in my teens, once maybe ten or fifteen years later. I often change my opinion of a book in a 15-year span, but in this case I didn't. This book is interesting, especially for its time, but not satisfying."
2,Poor copy of a classic,"This version is riddled with typos and mistakes. Disappointing and at times confusing. e.g. ""aird"" instead of ""and"", h instead hand, e instead of come. Guess you get what you pay for with this one!"
2,Too many typos!,"While one of my favorite novels, the alarming number of typos really distracted from the enjoyment. Actually even dug out and went back to my old paperback copy twice to sort out an ambiguity - and I don't mean with Mellors' dialect. Purchase another version if you want less than forty to fifty errors in your book!"
1,Proof some people have issues...,"This book was SO moving. It brought up a few important issues, like sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, and guess what?Sex!It is disgusting how the world has become nowadays. It's disgraceful! God-fearing people, stay away from this book!!!!It's trash for your mind and brings up perverted topics. You shouldn't read this book. We didn't. It's a book of scandal, corruption, seduction, and SIN!!!!"
2,Effortless work by a Great Writer,"If you want a good Lawrence book, read Sons and Lovers or Women in Love instead. Lady Chatterly, although written later, is much more immature in terms of style than Lawrence's first book, sons and lovers. The popularity probally results from the scandal that surrounded the book and not the writing or plot. The book only has real importance in a sociological reading, showing the social mores of the period it was written in."
2,the book,"I have not read the whole book and don't know if I will.I got it after reading fifty shades of grey, thought I would readit and see what was diffrent....."
3,Great Digital Version of Really Bad Book,"I had no issues with OCR character recognition issues or editing problems whatsoever in this version of the book. This is often a problem with the classics I buy. However...I bought this book after seeing it suggested in an Entertainment Weekly sidebar about books recommended along with 50 Shades of Grey (sort of a historical version of 50 Shades of Grey, if you will.) Now, I read Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence in college and liked it quite a lot, so I figured what the heck? I'll give Lady Chatterly's Lover a try. I could only muscle my way through the first half of the book before I gave up. It was horrible. Just horrible. A few flashes of Lawrence's brilliant mind here and there, but so vague and meandering and phallo-centric I just couldn't stand to keep reading. If you are hoping for a typical ""classic"" type read, this is not it."
1,Sexist Fantasy,"Male readers may find this book interesting (or at least titillating). I doubt it has many female fans. The female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part (Lawrence likes to call this ""gentleness""); and that this type of sexual relationship is all a woman should really need of a man."
3,porn classic,"Published in 1928, Lady Chatterley's Lover was D. H. Lawrence's last novel--it was also his most daring and blatantly erotic work. Even by today's standards, it's erotica, or ""erotic romance."" Like two of his previous novels, it was banned on publication, a ban which lasted until 1960. But an uncensored edition of the book was privately printed in Italy and copies were smuggled all over Europe and America.The storyline is quite simple--a bored wife out in the country married to a rich, feeble, annoying husband in a wheelchair falls in love (and lust) with the robust and exciting gamekeeper employed by her husband. Sooner or later things are bound to go wrong, and this can't end happily.This isn't Lawrence's best-written novel, but it is his most groundbreaking work, as it created decades of discussion and debate about what could/should and couldn't/shouldn't be published.David Rehakauthor of Love and Madness"
3,Cruelty to Flowers...,"This book has some of the richest imagery that you will find anywhere. There are hidden thematic morsels strewn throughout the text. However, Lawrence's style is often pedantic and tiresome. If you want to see his best work, I would suggest that you read St. Mawr or The Man Who Died."
3,Ambiguous,"I love Lawerences poetry, so I figured I would also love his best novel. I was disappointed. The book was very honest about human nature and feelings. The language was very beautiful also and very descriptive in nature, however as I am still in my teenage years I believe the whole love story plot was just too much for me. Even though it was presented in a very realistic manor, I just couldnt get into the story. I do not hate the book entirely. I loved many passages, but the plot made me want to skim over certain parts. I do believe I will stick to his poetry for now on."
2,read for curiosity's sake,"Why is this book so famous? Some say for its quality, some say for its incredibly controversial (at the time of publication) sexual content. It's worth reading for the whole *this was banned and mega-controversial and is it pornography or art?* sort of thing, but I didn't think it was believable or otherwise well written. It's quite sexist, and it's somewhat boring."
4,Societial Repression,"Lady Chatterley's Lover was an excellent book. Lawrence depicts many aspects of mankind that were, at the time, way down on the ""d.l."" Constance found herself in a marriage with a cripled man incapable of fulfilling any of her needs, intellectual and sexual. She was once inthralled by his hopelessly romantic philosophies of life, but grew to find them shallow and superficial. Her pity for Clifford was what held the two together for so long, but Constance, over time, tired of playing house wife, and ventured to find her contentment elsewhere. She didn't have to travel far. Constance found her happiness on her very own property through her manservant, thus began the scandalous affair the world has been talking about ever since."
4,intense and sincere with a very plain ending,"the novel is intense and exquisite, it must be remenbered that the book remained banned in England for a while and the author was the target of numerous attacks, but the truth prevails as it always do. the sincerity in the traetment of body functions was too much for the time;now when everything is permissible, it does not seem like a graet deal.there is only one thing which forces me to give this book only 4 stars and that is the horrible ending, so plain, read for yourselves and get dissapointed."
3,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"Some of the ""intellectual"" social commentary was boring, the broad English dialect was hard to figure out, but otherwise it was very good."
2,Lady Chatterley's Lover,Bought this and Fanny Hill at the same time out of curiousity about two rather famous books. Didn't particularly care for either; however this one rated a little higher due to more story line other than the sex.
3,an average classic,"I often find that a number of classics are highly overrated. I believe this to be true of this novel. That it was written so long ago is what makes it noteworthy. The story often feels drawn out; and, during the course of reading this, I found my mind wandering off. I probably would not recommend this book to anyone, but I might not encourage them to avoid reading it either."
3,Glad I read it,"I enjoyed reading this since it's an icon among banned books. The story was entertaining, but there were long stretches of blah-blah-blah which I just scanned through. Had absolutely no idea of what the author was saying, and didn't care either. It was interesting to read about the coal mining, though, and the description of the town and surrounding area was quite good (gloomy, depressed). As another poster observed, the book is full of ""typos"" like deity/deny, and/arid, finger/linger, knows/knobs, etc. That was annoying, but the book was cheap so I guess that's what you get for cheap."
2,Too many typos,"Whilst Lawrence wrote an astounding book for the time, this version needs serious editing. The number of typos destroys meaning and reduces parts to drivel."
3,Lady Chatterly's Lover: D.H. Lawrence At His Best,"There is no disputing the creative genius of D.H. Lawrence and Lady Chatterly's Lover is an icon of great storytelling and writing. I think everything that can be said about it has been said. However, I take issue with this Penguin Classics edition (2009)in just one regard. The size of the book which apparently determined the typeface size. It is a handsome and informative production and it seems a shame to have not been more generous with the overall size of the book and the size of the typeface. It is a detail that would possibly encourage more readers of all ages to discover or rediscover this splendid and beautiful story."
4,A gorgeous book,"I adored the sexual freedom of this book, the way it voiced an opinion I've held deep inside without voicing it for fear of sacrilege: intellect is not sustenance enough to live on, rather, it can sometimes drain you of sustenance.Though I dare to call myself feminist, my approval of Mellors denies this -- I suppose the female part of me ignores the intellectual feminist part."
4,An exquisite rendition of love's perils in a hierarchy.,"D.H. Lawerence's book of love in the most remote of settings is both compelling enough to read non- stop, while incorporating cultural aspects of the times. As with many of Lawerence's other novels the parallels to that of his own life are plainly seen. The minning buisness that is the center of Clifford's dwindling fortune and the occupation of his studies further into the novel, is directly linked to the boyhood of Lawerence. As with Oliver Mellors's questionable sexuality, that to was an issue that Lawerence had addressed about himself in his adulthood. Overall the only difficulty is found in the Derbyshire english that is used by Mellors. In all the novel was a very intriguing and well endowed for it's time leading to it's banning in both the U.S. and in Great Britian. Challenging reading for anyone that is intrested in exploring both the historical and the romanticism of the cast system."
1,Much Ado About Lady Chatterley,"I read 30 pages of the book, and put it down. The author does not make me care about Lady Chatterley as a person. I want to feel some sort of sympathy for a character, even if she makes mistakes.Frankly, Lawrence should have wrote this under a pseudonym and marketed it as erotica/pornography. It would have escaped the censors at the time and he would have made money off of it, at least."
2,Famous because it was banned,"I picked this book up in honor of banned book week. It seems to me that this book gained more notoriety off the fact that it was banned than because it was a great piece of literature. I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1920s, as the writing style was more reminiscent of a Victorian era novel. Furthermore, Lawrence portrayed his characters as if they were in the Victorian era. The characters were not well developed, thus making it hard to have sympathy for anyone in the story. The end was disappointing as it simply fizzled away."
5,Lady Chatterley's Lover.,"Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence. Published by MobileReference (mobi)Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which celebrates the driving passions that can make life worth living."
4,Small but comfy,"The foam never came to the full size of the mattress-it is couple of inches short on each side. It is very comfortable, and since I'm short it doesn't really matter if it is 2 inches shorter than the mattress itself. It's a good way to ""beef up"" your old matress while you save for a new one."
5,Amazing,"After being deployed for about month my back couldn't take the terrible mattress any more, so I bought this. Instant relieve. I started getting better sleep and performed better through out the day. This mattress made a big difference in how well I slept. No more tossing and turning and waking up multiple times in the middle of the night."
1,Disappointing purchase,"This mattress pad was delivered to us with yellow stains on the surface. When opened and unfolded, it wouldn't fit a queen bed much less a king!"
3,Comfy but still stinky a week later,"I've only had this a week, so maybe the smell will eventually go away, but in a well-ventilated room, this pad still smells like super-elastic bubble plastic a week after I set it up.It is comfortable and true to size on a full-sized klik-klak sofa bed. And it makes the difference between a truly comfortable guest bed and one that I am sure left my guests wondering whether I secretly wanted them to leave. Seriously. It's one of those sofas where the back folds down, and it was like a torture device. I thought I was going to have to replace it, but the topper is thick and supportive enough to make the bed comfortable, without being so thick that the couch won't fold up. I made a cover for it out of a duvet cover, and it sits right on top."
3,$55 at walmart,i have this actually 2x of these on my bed...i love it but i think i will buy 2 more. they are only $55 at any walmart and you don't have to pay shipping. 2 make it comfy and 2 more should make it perfect. the 1 1/2 are the only ones that are true memory foam. watch for larger and more expensive ones that are a blend.
3,Not what I expected,"This is a great matress ""topper"". This is, in my opinon, very pricey for something that feels flattend out to a pancake. I expected a little firmness for the $$."
2,Too short,"This works well for where it hits the body, but it is way too short, stops at the knees, it is not as long as a twin bed. It was also difficult to unroll after it was delivered, it sticks to itself so had pull it apart and get it to lay flat."
4,Serta Mattress Topper,"I bought the twin to use on a queen size mattress. It's a little short lengthwise but it works fine. I sleep a lot better and even though my back still hurts in the morning, I get a good night's sleep. The topper seems to soften the bony parts of the body a lot better than a regular mattress. I have a ""Sleep Number"" mattress which I was never able to find the right firmness or softness. With the topper I am able to have the Sleep Number at a comfortable firmness that gives me a good feeling and helps me to go to sleep quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having trouble sleeping with a firm mattress."
4,wrong size,The mattress topper is comfortable enough but I was disappointed thata a twin size was sent to me when a full size had been ordered. We are still using it for a different bed but won't order another.
5,I sleep much better now!,"I'm currently sleeping on a twin bed with bad springs. I used to wake up not only with back pain from poor support, but with sore spots from some springs poking into me! I bought this mattress, and my nights have been MUCH more comfortable. It can't make up as much for the lack of support, but the springs don't poke me and the bed is now softer."
5,AMAZING!,"Best $50 I have ever spent. Took my mattress for alright not too bad to, ""I can't wait to lay down!"" I am deployed in Afghanistan and a good nights sleep is one of the most important things you can get. You will thank me later!"
4,good stuff,"all around good album rock superstar is a phat single rest of the two cds is solid but no real standouts...best tracks: 17,3(but its pretty much same as 17),12,7,9,10,16 and I liked the intro too"
3,I liked the Rock half,"I am a fan of the Rock n' Roll side of Cypress Hill, but not a fan of the Rap side, so i rated this CD a fair 3 stars becuz i thought they should have made the whole album Rock!... the good songs are ""rock superstar"", ""a man"", and ""get out of my head"", while u can count on me havin the Bones in the Stereo, count on ""skull"" bein in the trash!"
4,Good....For What it Is,Metal Rap bands tend to do poorly but these guys were different. They seem like their down with everyone and that's good. The talent level in rapping was very high but some of the songs fell flat with the beats etc. You should get this if you're into CYpress because they are good it's just that a lot of their songs aren't great.2 Best Songs - Stank A** H** & (Rock) Superstar2 Worst Songs - Cuban Necktie & Certified Bomb
4,Cypress Comes Full Circle,"After two pretty trippy albums (Temples of Boom & IV) Killa Hill returns hard core with Skull and Bones. I liked Skull a lil bit more, I think B-Real comes across as something of a HIspanic Fred Durst on Bones, but still Valley Of Chrome and Get Out of My Head were pretty tight. Everything off Skull is good, even the intro, which probably has the best beat of the CD!! Another Victory, What U want from me, Rap Superstar....all sweet songs.....reminds you of Black Sunday updated for the 2000"
3,Ya can listen till track 11,Till the track 11 I liked the LP but the rest of the tracks are heavy and I hate heavy. But the rest is real interesting speacially Certified Bomb. That's just my opinion if you like heavy it could be that you like this album more than me.
5,what can I say they just shocked me....,"being a long time music fan of everything from country, to rap,to rock, to metal I can say I've heard some rather unsaul mixes ofmusic... most rappers normally stick to a syenthic drum and bassmachine, the Hill is the first rap group to venture into this style, I mean [an artist] like Limb Bisket have tried it and don't do as well as these guys have with this album.... However some of the underground bands like Primer 55 is one I recommend if your in to distint orginal music,much like the hill. infact I was shocked to find this much cool sounding tracks on a band labeled main stream by most, to me their one of a select few of great music I call outlaws in the music busness main stream or underground there is no denying that they kick ass..."
2,Enjoyable rap album but didn't care for the rock stuff.,"The album was for me a matter of personal taste in fact. I believe that DJ Muggs brilliant hip-hop production with its typical fare of stringy and tinkling pianos help to reinforce the imagery and violence of the underground gangster life. I relished the skulls disc. On the other hand, being a hip-hop purist, I really didn't enjoy the rock disc all that much. I presume that it was a wonderful experiment but I really wasn't so hyped on the actual execution. I wish that Cypress Hill finds a new direction in its production and that it turns to a heavier hip-hop style like the way that the Wu is evolving. Rap superstar is a must hear however."
3,stick to hiphop,cypress hill are known for there good hiphop skills and their ability to flow and make tight beats. so why change? their rock side is not that bad but they should stick to hiphop and produce more albums like temples of boom. i guess cypress i just tryin to get all poplular on mtv and kroq i guess. whatever happened to keeping it real?
1,Ya valió gorro Cypress Hill!,"De por sí el Hip Hop de Cypress era una porquería comparado con Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy E, Westside Connection, etc... y ahora salen con sus cancioncitas mezcladas con Rock, ¿no que muy cholos?. Debo reconocer que las tonadas en rock no están nada mal, pero no le quedan a Cypress Hill. Va a parecer ahora como Cypress-Bizkit. El Hip Hop metal solo queda bien como las canciones en donde ha participado Ice Cube con Korn, pero Cypress Hill... ¡mejor me quedo sin comentarios!."
2,Not a good cd,"I will start out by saying, i have been following cypress hill since i first heard ""insane in the brain"" back when it was first released, and when this cd came out i bought it right away and was very excited about it. But, the only good songs are ""Rap Superstar"" and ""Rock Superstar"". And, after hearing ""Rock Superstar"", i don't listen to ""Rap Superstar"" anymore. the difference between the two is that ""Rock Superstar"" has everlast at the begining instead of eminem, there are some really cool guitar riffs, and there is an extra verse that is awesome! But, that is the only track i listen to. My reccomendation is to either find those 2 on single if you can, or just download them online and save the [money]. If you are a diehard fan, however, pick it up just to fill your collection, but not for any other reason."
5,A very good idea !,"I've been a big Cypress Hill fan for years and this CD is probably their best since ""Black Sunday"". And the idea of the 2 cd's is really cool, it's like the good against the bad ! I hope that the american hip-hop scene will follow them. I like the way they are, very simple. I've been listening to the second CD for days. I know all the lyrics by heart... Don't hesitate to buy it, it really worth it !"
4,Still strong,"This is a pretty sweet album. It shows Cypress Hill still has something to give and they are not finished. True, there are no real memorable beats or songs, but the rhymes are still tight as always by B-Real and Sen Dog. Having guests like Fear Factory gives the album a boost. For their 5 major albums, I would put this one in third, behind Black Sunday and IV."
2,Disappointing,"Im not big into rap. Not much hip hop either. But Ive always liked Cypress Hill. I own Cypress Hill III,IV, Stoned Raiders and Black Sunday. Thats some good stuff.This album was way too flip out and go nuts style. Its like thats all they were going for. I thought Can I Get A Hit was kinda cool...Skulls is the Rap CD, and Bones is the Metal CD. Id have to say Skulls is not my kinda rap (my kind being similar to the albums I mentioned I owned), and Bones is pretty bad metal. Some of the metal is cool, but bad for the most part.I liked Stoned Raiders, but I think it was the album that said `Were tired of chillin, we wanna freak out.` Thats what this album is."
2,Skull And Bones,"Four albums deep, Cypress Hill has been criticized heavily lately for still sounding exactly the same as they did when they first came out in 1991. Well, this was their answer; a half rap and half rock album.Muggs also experiments on the rap side and the result is, well boring. The rock side might attract new fans to the Hill, but for anyone who doesn't like rock music...this is only a waste of 6 tracks.So if you like rap/rock combos, this might be for you. If not, there is nothing here worth your money."
1,What has this World come to,"I couldn't believe my ears when I first put this CD in my stereo. The first thing I did was curse at my roomate for telling me to buy the album, before I actually threw the CD case at him. I've owned and enjoyed every single Cypress Hill CD so far, especially Black Sunday, a Rap classic. The new Cypress album is just a poor attempt to sell some albums to the same kids that listen to Limp Biskit and junk like that. I had hoped that Cypress would have changed, for the better, either musically or lyrically, but they sold out, and that's really bothering me. I'm gonna go listen to some Outkast, peace"
1,The worst cd ever!!,"This is the worst cd I've ever bought. I mean it really blows. The only good songs are rap and rock superstars and its a double disc, so that really sucks. I thought this would be a good cd, but I was wrong. It sucked so bad that I sold it to a used cd store. I lost nine bucks on this cd. So if you like rap then don't buy this cd, because if you do you'll be disapointed. If you want a good cd buy Dr. Dre ""Chronic 2001"", Snoop Dogg ""Tha Last Meal"" or Too $hort ""You Nasty""."
3,Half as good.,"Following on from the great 'Cyprus Hill IV' has been a difficult thing for the Soul Assasins. For me the first CD is ruined by an over-used highhat and 'tinny' drums drawing attention away from the usually excellent bass. The second CD, however, is very good and if you are going to buy a rap album this summer 'Bones' means this CD should be a high priority. Annother problem I had was Cyprus Hill's fast rapping, very impressive but it moves them into territory that doesn't suit them so well as the slow, melodious rap we have wittnesed in recent times. Anyhow, still worth a few coins."
3,Its aight,"This is probaly the worst Hill album i dont really like most of this. First off the rap disc has some tight tracks on like ""Stank ass hoe"" which has sick beats ""Cuban Necktie"" and ""Rap superstar"" but thats about it tracks like ""We Live this sh-t"" and ""Certified Bomb"" aint as good.The rock disc. I aint a fan of metal so thats a minus for this already. Valley of Chrome is the best on this disc. I like Cant get the best of me because that got me into the Hill when I heard them on the radio. The others aint no good and a just wack, eben tho the chorus for A Man is alright.If u are into the more metal side of cypress then buy it.and thats all i have to say about that."
2,Musically their worst...,"Cypress Hill, of course, has nothing new to talk about in this album, but no surprise there. Lyrically, they are still very good. Musically, however, there are maybe three or four songs out of SEVENTEEN that are worth listening to more than once. The second CD is composed of six hard-rock tracks. I think it's safe to assume that Cypress was thinking about certain ""musicians"" like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc. and are simply trying to compete. Instead of sticking to their roots, Cypress Hill attempts to ""branch out"" into territory that they aren't known for and can't do very well. Their first four albums are much better musically, but maybe it's no surprise. They weren't worried about making hard rock tracks back then. Save your money."
3,"Boring Beginning, Useful Second Half","We found the low energy and tense presentation in the beginning to be off-putting. The general overview and history sections felt unhelpful. The camera angles and switches from close to distant in annoying ways. Nonetheless, once the discussion of each individual type began, we felt more engaged and interested. We would use this second half to give students an interesting and useful overview of the nine types."
1,Ridiculous & Dumbed Down,What an awful disappointment. If you feel that a proper Science and Nature question is where Carrie Bradshow's computer is stored is up your alley...go for it. The questions are simplistic and out of a people magazine. The geography and history questions aren't globally orientated like the older versions. A poor excuse for a wonderful game.
4,What about the rest of the world?,The game is ok but I miss a little bit more of questions related on events beyond the US frontiers. To me it is too much focused on US events. That is the reason I have rated just with 3 stars the educational value.
3,It's Ok....,I feel like the the questions are poorly worded and more mundane than previous versions.
2,For kids,"It's not really apparent the target age group of this book, until you read it. It's really bedtime story type format."
3,Could use a correction or two.,"Current research among game historians is that playing cards appeared in Europe around the 1370's, not the 13th century. Also, tarot cards start appear later so they evolved from standard playing cards, not the other way aroundas it suggests."
2,OK just for a cushion,It is very floppy and the back has no support. It is OK for just a cushion. I cut it apart and now have 2 cushions.
2,Waist of Money,My daughter really loved this. Although some stations did not play she did enjoy it while it worked. About a month after the warrenty ran out the speakers stopped working.
2,COULD HAVE BEEN A 5 STAR,"WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO HAVE THE FRENCH SPELLING, THE PICTURE AND THE ENGLISH WORD BUT NOT KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE IT? VERY NICE PICTURES, COVERS JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF BUT IS NO GOOD FOR SOMEONE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE."
2,"Not a Dictionary, No Pronunciation",A dictionary doesn't do me any good if it doesn't have pronunciation. Apparently the publisher was too lazy to include it. They took what could have been a great book and did a half baked job. They should be ashamed of themselves.
4,More like a 4 1/2 star book,"This is a very fine, well-written book, and it has become pretty much a standard text in the history of the West. Though the setting is by and large eastern Wyoming of the late nineteenth century, and the subject matter is cattle ranching, this book will be much more satisfying to liberal-minded historians and populists than typical cattle ranchers. Anyone who appreciates or sympathizes with the underdogs in SHANE but would like a more historically accurate picture of the struggles for land and cattle in the West might want to give this a look. It is wholly satisfying from expository, sociopolitical, and historical standpoints."
1,Automated Payroll Processing Is Now an Add-on Charge,"As the treasurer for a church with six employees, I have used QuickBooks for the accounting and payroll for the church for more than a decade.I just upgraded the software used by the church to QuickBooks Basic 2005 this year and found that we can not use QuickBooks to compute the payroll tax withholdings unless we subscribe to one of Intuit's payroll services. This is a change in the way payroll is handled by the software from previous additions of QuickBooks Basic.This additional subscription makes the cost of upgrading to QuickBooks Basic 2005 more than triple the published software price (...) because the least expensive of the subscriptions is $199 per year.In response, I have developed a an Excel spreadsheet that can do the computations for our organization and I will not be subscribing to Intuit's payroll service.The rest of the package seems to work as intended."
1,I would have given it a 0 star if I could.,"Just do one thing. Try to create an invoice with British Sterling Pound symbol or Japanese Yen symbol.It doesn't take many problems for a software to be obsolete. Just one problem that cannot be fixed.If you have a global dream for your small business, this software isn't it.What a junk. I am going back to Microsoft Money."
3,"lovely, but it's more of a recipe book, really...","This is a gorgeous book, with gorgeous flowers. However, it's less of a learning tool, then a recipe book. While it does grace upon a few floral design basics, it doesn't spend a great deal of time on it. The raw information it conveys is pretty light, having more to do with warm, neutral, and stark colors, as well as a few techniques on drying flowers and taping them (etc). The bulk of the book is taken up by pictures of arrangements, and little ""recipes"" on how to make them. A good book for someone who doesn't want to learn the mechanics of floral design, a good book for the coffee table -- but ultimately, not a good book for someone who wants to study design on a more advanced or technical level."
3,Not easy but historically interesting,"I have made several Quilt in a Day quilts, but this one is a difficult piece of work. I am finding the directions a bit ambiguous and I have to look ahead to keep my blocks and pieces the right size. I think a very experienced quilter could enjoy this project, but it is definitely not for a beginner. And if you go the QIAD website you find video companions to this book. Unfortunately, the video companion gives no help in the step by step construction.But, I am working my way to a nice quilt."
4,READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST.,"I have been quilting for about 3 years. Like many of the other people who wrote a review, I found it difficult to follow some of the instructions. To get it right, I had to take my time and make sure the cutting and sewing was exact. It is a great challenge and it has made me a more precise sewer. You don't need to be an expert quilter but having some quilting knowledge would help. Even with some parts being difficult the end results are worth while."
5,Undergriund Railroad Sampler,"I am a Quilter, and I found this book to be a real Eye opener for what went on during the slavery days. I never knew how Quilts were used as codes to direct the slaves to freedom. This book is a real history lesson, that I am so glad to learn about and be a part in helping with the teaching of the slavery days. I was asked by a teacher to make this quilt. She is going to hang it in her classroom for her 5th grade students to make paper blocks, to match the Quilt. The Quilt tells the story. It's AWESOME, and I really enjoyed making it. Thank you Amazon for having this Quilt Book."
5,The Underground Railroad Sampler,The book was everything I thought it would be - comprehensive quilt instructions for various underground railroad blocks.
5,Excellent!,I bought this book for a class I am taking to make this quilt. It is very easy to follow and I like that the authors have included an explanation for each square. Any level quilter would enjoy adding this to their collection.
3,Too Complicated for a Beginner,"I am fairly new to quilting and the blocks in this book that say 'for a beginner' are NOT easy, as far as I am concerned. I was very confused and irritated at the methods used by the authors and would love to find a book where you REALLY can make a quilt in a day.I loved the pictures in the book, but not the directions. I found them to be too difficult for a beginner and it should not say that a block is for a beginner when obviously it is not at all for a beginning quilter.Over all, I was disappointed."
1,Complicated...historically and practically,"I am an experienced quilter and collector of books related to hand pieced quilts tracing back to the days of slavery and the Underground Railroad. I jumped to purchase this book because of the title and because I have successfully used other Burns' books/patterns. The intructions for each block were unnecessarily complicated. The pictured quilts were lovely, but I'd prefer to see them without the attempted ""staging"" of history - each quilt presented by the same woman in period costume. It just didn't sit well with me."
5,Xikar can't be beat!,"This little guy is amazing. It's light weight, durable as all get out, easy to use and attractive. Mechanically the XI2 is very simple and when it comes to a cutter, simple is better. One thing that had me a little worried with the XI2 was the shape. Since I was used to guillotine cutters I wasn't sure if the XI2 would allow a steady grip but rest assured, when gripped properly the cutter won't shift in your hand.Whether this is your first cutter or you are just looking for something to expand your arsenal, this is defiantly one to consider.Happy smoking all!"
4,Ethereal Debut,"This debut by Ira Sher was like nothing I've read before. It took me several pages to get into the groove of the author's writing style - he demands a close reading, choosing to pack in a sentence, say, what other writers take a paragraph or two to convey. But, the prose is gorgeous, the imagery beautiful and haunting. The book is about a boy's father who is chosen to be the first ""non-astronaut"" to walk on the moon. When his father goes ""missing,"" the reaction is not exactly what you'd envision. The novel captures the lost innocence of a previous era, where America held wide-eyed wonder at man's accomplishments, yet it also foretells the squander of the crass and shallow emotionalism and misguided intentions of today's frenzied media exploitations. The novel is not for everyone: I would definitely classify it as ""post-modern"", for the ending is anything but tidy, but that is, perhaps, exactly what the author intended."
1,1931-Vintage Silliness,"This is a slight, silly book, more space and air than content. For example: when ""An Old Flame comes to Luncheon"", the suggested menu is sole in aspic, partridge (shot through the head), grape sauce (rather sour), passion fruit frappe, coffee, and cigarettes. The concluding notation advises the hostess not to give the mangled remains of the luncheon to her husband for dinner.At best a gag present."
2,Not great shape,"Arrived on time, decent price, but book was dirty and since I had intended to give as a gift, I was unable to do so. To me 'good condition' should not denote unclean."
2,"Please God, make it end!","I bet a high school Senior that I would read this, (which he says is his favorite book) because it's out of my comfort zone. He has to read ""Friday Night Lights"" for the same reason.I can stand it, but barely. Makes me wonder about the author. Why would anyone go to so much trouble to invent all this gobblydegook?Actually, although I really do HATE the genre, this book is well enough written to keep me going."
3,Good information for owners with no training,I think that this book offers good information for people that do not know how to handle a reactive dog situation. However I was hoping for more about fixing the problem not just deferring the problem.
5,very good book!,"I like the very friendly work with dogs, and Patriciaalways looks that the dogs feel great in what he is doing!And besides the happy dog learns faster!very good book!"
2,Teaching good avoidance.,This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then. I personally can't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then. It goes over desentization (not rocket science) but doesn't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues. I'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory. It's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it's puppy-ness or real aggression concerns.
1,Not helpful,"Much shorter than i expected, basic information provided. The entire book could be summed up in a paragraph or two. Her method teaches you to feed your reactive dog a treat every time you say ""watch"" and they make eye contact with you. Eventually use this method when your dog sees another dog."
4,Works well,This has helped our dog to be comfortable walking on a leash. It just requires working with them & following the book.
5,Great book for leash reactive dogs,"I got this book for my large, leash reactive dog. I have been working on the strategies in this book with my dog and have seen big improvements. I love that it uses positive training methods to help my dog be in control and successful when he sees another dog (or anything that heightens his anxiety) . This book was highly recommended to me by our dog trainer, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is feeling frustrated when walking their dog. It is a quick read, packed with TONS of valuable information."
4,Short and to the point,"Although not as easy as it sounds, this book was very helpful with my boxer who was leash reactive to other dogs. She's still a work in progress, but the methods in this book are effective. Good, to the point info."
3,Feeding Feisty Fido,This method requires constant food as a distraction to the dog. The book was better than Cautious Canine but still left me without a workable solution to the problem. Cost too much for the type of book this is (booklet)
5,Beautiful collection!! A must have!,"If you love movies with uplifting story lines and incredible dancing, this is for you!! I highly recommend the entire set. Astaire and Rogers are incredible! No one has come close to them since!!"
3,Fun but not essential,"Jimmy Buffet meets Wayne Newton meets El DeBarge is a good way to describe Brother Noland. This was one of the first hawaiian albums I bought and may be a bit quirky for some. As I stated above, it is a fun, but non-essential album to have in your hawaiian CD collection. Standout tracks include, ""Juju Rock"", ""Coconut Girl"", ""Big Ship"", ""Harbor Town"", and ""Pua Lane""."
5,A true man of Hawaii,"I bought this CD after hearing Brother Nolan live in Maui. His spirit and love of Hawaii and Island Music just reaches out and grabs you. He loves singing and it radiates throughout his music. This is a fun and enjoyable CD. I have listened to it multiple times since buying it. Simply put Brother Nolan's music brings a smile to my face and warms my heart. Sit back relax and if you don't live in Hawaii, let this CD take you there."
3,"My husband liked the ease and convenience, but ...","My husband liked the ease and convenience, but for just the beard and mustache, it seems a waste of much of the product. It would be better in a smaller size for beard and mustache only and this size for hair."
3,box lacks mustache brush and cup,"The product is good but since it says for mustache and beard as well as head I expected it would have a brush and small cup to mix and apply the color to mustache and/or beard. Clairol used to provide them in their hair color boxes. Very bad decision not to include, for those of us who only color our mustache or beard a brush is very useful. Therefore I'm lowering my rating to 3 stars out of 5."
4,The packaging was nice but a little crowded ...,The packaging was nice but a little crowded on the front. It was very easy to use and didn't leave a mess. WE LOVED THE NO-DRIP GEL. We liked that it was an all-in-one kit. We'd recommend this product. It was easy to use and turned out nice.
3,Response to reader from NY,"Before condemning the entire Arab world, try reading an interpretation of the Qur'an first. That might help you understand this religion a bit better. In addition, try reading something on the history of Islam and the three religions that sprang from the Middle East. I pity your ignorance, but fortunately, Amazon is here to help!"
1,Absolutely disgusting,"This was, without a doubt, the grossest shake I've ever tried. I used their shaker, and after nearly five minutes of vigorous shaking it STILL had chunks in it. Don't even think of trying to drink it out of the shaker's drinking spout... it's so thick it won't move... and not in a good way, in a like-the-stuff-you-clean-out-of-the-tub-drain way. To add insult to injury? It's GREEN! I'm not even kidding... it's a chunky, bubbly, thick mess of green that is totally gross. Waste of money."
1,Kuryakyn Hupercharger PN9999.,"I Bought This Item Kuryakyn Hypercharger PN9999 For My 2006 HD XL1200C. The Ad Claimed To Have Everything I Needed. The Ad Said It Would Fit My Bike WITH STOCK CARB!!!. Well When It Came Time For Step 2 In The Instruction Sheet It Said To Install The Carb Adaptor Plate And My Old Breather Assy. So I Called Tech Support And They Told Me I Had To Buy A Crank Case Breather Adaptor Kit For XX Amount Of Dollars. But If I Would Have Bought The Pro Series Kit, That Would Have Included The Breather Kit. W.T.F. So I Sent It Back. AT My Expence Of $14.88 Through Fedx. Now They Are Trying To Charge Me A 20% Restocking Fee. I Will Not Do Business With Powersport Superstore Again. Buyer Beware!!!!."
3,Damaged,The book was intended for a gift but the cover was damaged when I received it. Unfortunately I just had to deal with it because I was too lazy to return it.
2,Good for a child,I wanted a book that would give me an overview of US Presidents. This was less information than I had hoped for. I think this would be a good addition to a young persons reference books....maybe get them interested in history. It doesn't have much data.
2,SOSO,Not what I expected.If i had known this was at Poker Stars on someones elses computer I would have to pass.
5,Perfect For High Traffic Areas,"If you live on a 25mph street in a subdivision, then spend a few extra bucks and get a sturdier mounting bracket. If, like me, you live on a high traffic road where replacing a downed mailbox is something you have to do multiple times a year, then this is a great product.It's not a rigid mount. The mailbox will move a bit when you open and close it. This flexibility is a negative to some, but to me it's a huge positive. Since the plastic flexes and breaks before wood or metal, it means that I don't always have to replace the post, or even the mailbox, when someone takes it down. Sometimes I just need to replace the mounting board, and the fact that it's a plastic board means that's a relatively cheap repair."
5,own it. love it.,used this in college and still use it for references in my radio broadcasting career. I read it from time to time to help freshen up my broadcasting lingo
3,"OK, if your're into shells","I bought this book on the strength of reviews here. I was sadly disappointed when I tried to identify some plant fossils I had found. The section on plants has only 4 pages. The rest of the book is almost entirely devoted to marine fossils, (shells)."
4,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fossils,"An older book, never revised in 15 years it seems. Still appreciated by my sister, who it was gifted to. She's into archaeology. Appently still a good one."
1,not what I was expecting from other reviewers,"This journal has horid orangish-yellow pages and is wide ruled. It has a criss-cross leaf pattern next to each line, which is extremely distracting when trying to write. I was expecting a nice white paged college ruled type journal. I get a very busy feeling from this journal ...END"
2,ALMOST DEPRESSING,"I was excited to find a book about preconception but this particular book was a huge disappointment. It covered the facts- that's it. The material was dry and boring and nothing I haven't read already before. By the time I finally reached the end, still in hopes of something helpful, I got to the actual ""conception"" part- one slim chapter. Awful!! If you are truly stupid this book may be perfect for you. Huge waste of money."
1,A waste.,"Luckily I didn't buy this book, I borrowed it from a friend, because I would have been mad at wasting the money.If you've got good common sense and know the basics about being a generally healthy person then this book has nothing to offer. If you've never focused on health before and don't even know what the food pyramid is, then it's probably worth a read.My friend and I renamed this book, ""Common Sense - and Other [...] We Already Knew""."
2,Watch out for grammar,"I have recently started reading this book and I am having trouble getting through it. I am a former teacher, and the lack of editing in this book is truly annoying. I think it has good content from what I have read, but I think their editor did them a great disservice. The topics jump around and there are some serious grammatical errors in this book. I don't fault the authors, I fault the editor. Maybe it's just me, but these issues are slowing down my reading of this book :(."
3,Fairly Good Book,"This book had information about preparing to get pregnant, but I felt that a lot of the information was a little too basic. After reading it, I felt like I had only learned a couple things I needed to know or didn't already know."
4,Great for the concerned 1st time mom.,"I'm only about halfway through the book right now but it is good so far. I think that it is great for 1st time moms who are concerned about being ready for pregnancy. I think that a lot of what it teaches is common sense type stuff, but it can be a good re-enforcer to get you in the right mindset while trying to conceive. I would recommend this book for couples planning to start a family, rather than unplanned pregnancies, but it could still be helpful. As I said, I'm only about halfway through, but the friend of mine that recommended the book said that she thought that the end of the book was a bit of a letdown. She hoped that there would be more to it."
3,Not bad,"This is light reading. I read it cover to cover in about a day. Like other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of it is really basic. Don't smoke, don't do drugs, do lose weight if you are overweight. I did like the descriptions of vitamins and minerals, and the part where they make some healthy menus is pretty good as well, but it didn't tell me a lot I didn't know. I think it was pretty good, but nothing fabulous that I would tell someone they HAVE to read."
3,more about general nutrition then preconception,"This book was disappointing, it was more of a general nutrition/health book than a guide for preconception. Most of the recommendations were common sense, eat healthy, don't drink, try to be at your target weight, ect. I guess I was expecting advice I had not heard before (and this was the first book I read on the topic). However, the BMI chart was good, and there is some interesting information about vaccines."
2,This book is useful but all claims have not been proven.,"This book really freaked me out. I learned a lot, but concluded from my readings that no one is fit to have a child and that everyone interested in conceiving should have been raised in a bubble. The book uses the theory that you are better safe then sorry, but all of the claims are not backed up scientifically. My recommendation is to read the book and not take it too seriously, then make a prenatal appointment with a gynecologist. The doctor will put your mind at ease."
2,"Preconception info is very good, conception info isn't","If you're looking for detailed information on preconception health (e.g., the role of genetics in planning a healthy pregnancy, what herbal products are contraindicated during pregnancy, and so on), this is a very good book. But if you're looking for useful information on what you can do to increase your chances of conceiving quickly, you won't find it here. The authors only devote ten pages to the subject of ""how to get pregnant"", offering a very watered down version of the conception/fertility information you will find in other books such as The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas and Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler. So if you purchase a copy of this book, you'll also want to order copies of Douglas' and Weschler's books, too."
5,VERY HELPFUL BOOK,My husband and I thought that this book was exceptionally well written and very helpful for us as first time parents. Would definately recommend for other people.
5,So Informative!,"I purchased this book 6 months ago and now am one month pregnant! This was like my bible! Anytime I had questions, I referred to it. Definitely the best of its kind out there!"
3,Before I got pregnant,"I liked this book when I read it before I got pregnant. I had a very difficult first pregnancy, and developed severe pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, and I had to have an emergency c-section at 24 weeks. My son Tyler was born weighing 11oz. and he lived for 5 days. I was racked with as much guilt as grief, I read my books over and over on how I could have done things differently. Turn out I have a gentic blood disorder, and I was able to have a healthy, beautiful baby girl, a year and a half later. I was highly advised that I not get pregnant again, and I agree. I don't write this to scare women, but to let them know that sometimes you can do everything ""right"" and things just turn out in unexpected ways, and it's out of your control."
2,Very disappointing,"I think this book was written in a very conservative and clinical manner. Realisticly, life is not that serious. It would have been helful to read a more humorous, yet realistic approach to preparing for pregnancy."
2,Simple can be good thing...,"I found the book to be a little too simplistic, but then again maybe making babies is a simple thing. The information is good and basic on taking care of yourself before conception but does not go too much further. Moral of the story...Eat right, Exercise...Don't drink, smoke or do drugs (over the counter included)"
4,Good preconception reference,"This book is a really solid guide to preconception health. The authors do a good job of summarizing a lot of key medical data on this topic. I only have two minor quibbles with the book: there's a lot of ""filler"" (topics that aren't really related to preconception health, but that seem to have been thrown in to make the book a bit meatier) and sometimes the book isn't organized as well as it might have been. That wouldn't stop me from recommending the book to others, however, which is why I've given it four stars."
1,Under the Influence?,"It reads like Eloise has a severe case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). She orders ""three straight Johnny Walker Black"" (scotch) from room service and says ""Oh my Lord"" an astonishing amount. She uses the words ""cawn't"" and ""rawther"" and a plethora of made up words. A passenger on the plane is said to ""smoke 3 packs a day and laughs rawther loud"" and there isn't a smidgen of punctuation in the entire book. Yes, it does have French words and illustrations of Paris, but that can be found in many other books."
3,"It's not Jazz, it's not rock, it's not pop. What is it?","The Avantegarde styling on this album are quite simular to the works of Gary Peacock, only to a lesser extent. I liked it, but this album didn't have the bite I would expect from a Bassist like Trevor Dunn. On average I think this is a good first album, but from T. Dunn, with so much experience behind him, I expected more."
3,Something to tweak your brain and rock your naughty bits!,"I am a big fan of the more eccentricly hard music Trevor Dunn is associated with (Mr. Bungle, Fantomas). So I was a little disappointed in the ""jazz"" elements of this record. Although after a few listens I really began to love the musicianship and compositions on this record!!!! It is good for the brain and the groin! Trevor is an amazing musician complemened very well by Adam Levy and the great Kenny Wollesen! But not worthy of a 4 or a 5 star rating. Won't get very many repeat listens...."
5,A great introduction to DKM!,"I tracked down this EP mostly to hear Kay Hanley (formerly of ""Letters to Cleo"") on ""Dirty Glass"" but it's quickly become one of my favorites! This is quality punk. Just plain fun."
1,terrible product,"this deserves half a star. i bought it b/c it seemed to have everyhing i wanted. i returned it to the store within a week. it refused to recognise cds after the second day. its construction is terribly cheap. i thought i was getting a bargain, but i'll spend a little more for a quality brand. will stay away from memorex in the future.worse cd player i've ever bought. don't waste your money!!!!"
3,pretty good,I like the Recovery Complex Stress therapy better and hope it will become available again.
1,Product not as pictured,"When I received this product, it was NOT the item pictured. Please check your stock and correct the photograph. I have since returned the items in this order."
5,"Wonderful product, when you need it done right this is what you get.","I love this product, it delivers a great experience and is the only one I use, I have been using this product for many years, I love it."
2,A bit disappointed,"It looks and smells great, but I can't tell any difference in how my hair looks when I use it vs. when I don't! I have been using for about 2 weeks, and no noticeable decrease in frizziness of my hair. I have fine, straight hair."
2,Fragile,"I ordered a reptarium for my sugar gliders. And originally I had heard wonderful things about reptariums. However, when I took it apart the first time, some of the PVC pipes cracked... and it just seemed to be much more fragile than i had anticipated. I'm not keeping it, I am giving it away. Apparently, the quality of a reptarium is not what it used to be."
5,This Music has yet to be discovered by VHI,This is one of the greatest African artist today. Unlike other pops Africa musics is enjoyed by all ages and it's like wine its just get better the more you hear it..
5,Organized Directory with Accurate data,This is the most complete directory for Chambers of Commerce that I have ever seen. The information is accurate and in-depth.
5,not worthy of commendation,"what would be more reasonable going out and purchasing this rarity or leaving it to be just as is? because the reality of anyone having the slightest edge or curiosity of listening to such cacophony is way beyond that of which the mind can possibly consider to waive as an ultimatum. This particular release to say the least, couldn't have been more of a parody when compared to Spinal Taps attempt at a startom which to begin with wasn't even meant to be. This is exactly the case with this band. they're not only a product of the preposterous black metal band Marduk but as is Marduk they cannot uphold substantial chemistry of what makes up great music. Sure why not 5 dollars for a brewry would be exceptionally great but why stop there when anyone with a closed mind to material such as this doesn't even bother to know what the weird encryption on the cover reads"
4,"Easy to install, good quality","After purchasing one of these hooks for my guest bath, I ordered four more for other doors around the house. Good solid construction, nice style and no hassles with ""installation"" -- just hook one over the door and you're good to go!"
4,Sturdy & modern looking,"It is currently holding about 20 hangers of clothes (not that it ususally does, but it has been these days).My only issue is that, in hindsight, I would prefer a longer design..almost like a horizontal rack so I can sift through a few items or let more than 1-2 items ""dry out"" at the end of the day. This design is not as conducive to what I actually wanted to accomplish, but I should have realized that.Otherwise it is a well-made product."
4,UNDER THE HAMMER,"Above average British Mystery.If you love Rebus, Midsomer Murders, Poriort this is another above average Mystery.Was delivered in a fast manner. Arrive with no problem"
3,tame and bland,"Not a bad show but there is nothing here to really keep you hooked either. The acting is OK and the stories proceed at a leisurely pace. The characters are somewhat sympathetic, but not enough to keep me hooked."
1,NIGHTMARE,After opening the box I found the inside brackets that support the grill top Bent. Assembly of the unit is a nightmare unless you have the dexterity of a surgeon. I am glad I had my own hardware that I used to assemble the unit. Also the regulator supplied does not work properly. I feel ripped off and would never do business again with this outfit. The concept is good but of poor quality.
5,A story that needs to be told,As a children's librarian I have spent the past week reading Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot to my students. We have enjoyed every minute of it. Margot Raven brings Col. Halvorsen's story to an audience that is not familiar with the Berlin airlift. The book provides background and inspiration while recreating a moment in history. Have your chocolate close by when you read this one.
5,Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot,"This is the most beautiful childrens' book! It is a true story, I have been very fortunate to meet this pilot, Gail Halvorsen. This is a wonderful way for children to read about an important piece of history that had a lasting impact on not only a city but the millions of people saved by a great act of kindness. This particular event should not be lost, but kept alive. I highly recommend this book to children of all ages! Beautifully illustrated!"
2,Toy broke right away.,The toy looked durable but one of the rotors broke off right away. I would not suggest this as a toy but as a model.
2,Really sloppy,"This looks like it's intended more of a display piece, but it's not really that attractive. The joins between pieces of the toy are very poor with large gaps. The rotor does not feel all that sturdy, so if it's used as a toy, it probably will need to be fixed sooner rather than later. It's also a little annoying that the doors hinge open, I'm pretty sure these should be sliders. (Either do it right, or don't make them operating in my opinon)I got it for a auxilary piece for wargaming ,so it works for me, but this isn't a display piece unless you're planning on it being tucked away on a shelf where it won't get much scrutiny."
2,CD WITH INCOMPLETE SONGS,The CD HAS INCOMPLETE SONGS AND SOME OF THEM SCRAPPED. I DID NOT SEND IT BACK DUE TO SHIPPING COSTS.
2,Pages out of order!,"As much as I wanted this book, the pages were out of order. It was missing pages 9-16 completely with other pages repeating. It looks like it was put together incorrectly. When I returned it for a replacement, I got a second one with the same problems! Agh!"
5,Garfield Books Are Great!,I like all Garfield books but this is one of my favorites!I like Garfield because he`s funny and so is this book!
2,Real Mediocre Late 90's stuff,"1998, probably the most boring year ever for pop music and this soundtrack reflects it. If you like No Doubt and Matchbox 20 and such you'll love this one. They could have at least put in some cool techno considering the movie revolves around clubbers. Buy the movie and not the soundtrack."
3,Not nearly as good as I expected,"The movie ""GO"" was great. Most of the music in the movie was good too (the rave/techno stuff). The problem with the CD is that it only has one or two songs of that type. The CD obviously doesnt put every song from the movie on the soundtrack. Whoever picked the tracks should have picked more of the rave/techno music to put on the album and less of the boring stuff. The best song on the CD is BT-Believe."
4,Best Movie Soundtrack this year...so far,"A really great album with something for everyone. Very similar to the Trainspotting album but better. Songs from Len, Fatboy Slim, DJ Rap, and BT are reason enough to buy this CD. ""Cha Cha Cha"" is the most original song I've heard this year. I haven't seen the movie yet but now I can't wait to watch it."
4,Review for the soundtrack to GO,"This CD is great. I think everyone will love songs 1-5, the rest aren't too good, but 1-5 make up for it. It has a new songs from NO DOUBT, LEN, FATBOY SLIM, NATALIE IMBRUGLIA and much more. Natalie Imbrulia's song is amazing... and #3 , Magic Carpet Ride is great too. I would recommend this movie AND soundtrack, cause they were both awesome. wow!"
4,If you liked the movie....,"If you want to relive watching the movie, this soundtrack will do it for you. I'm not a big fan of dance music, but I like this soundtrack because I thought the movie was great. If you liked the movie soundtrack you won't be disappointed with this soundtrack."
4,I loved it !,"I am from Brazil, and I saw GO last week. The CD is fun and cool. I liked ""New"" very much.BUY IT !"
5,awesome!,"The movie was excellent and so was the soundtrack! Every song on here was good, especially Natalie Imbruglia's Troubled by the way we came together. Highly recommended."
2,Just another hip soundtrack,"Ah, when will it end. Every soundtrack now has to have a few techno tracks--which turns out to be a good thing in the case of ""Go."" The techno provides the real excitement--the rest is just boring alterna rock. Some of it is mighty catchy (""New"" actually had me going), but mostly it's just lameass pseudo grunge."
5,"""Go"" buy this soundtrack!!!","I was lucky enough to see a special screening of ""Go"" at a film festival I attended in Austin on March 16th. I can't wait until this film opens so that I can GO see it again and again. The film is not the only thing that rocks though. This perfectly put together soundtrack does a great job complimenting this film. The fast, pulsating beats keep up with the films fast paced storytelling. The music does a great job of adding tension when needed and makes you want to get up and party at other times. Trust me, even if you don't like this movie (which I highly doubt that's possible) you'll still love this soundtrack. So do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. :)"
2,Two great tracks missing...,"I've had this soundtrack for over a decade. It's a good eclectic mix, but 2 tracks that were used as background music in the movie are, sadly, missing...* Sunset Sky - ""Rockitt"" (when ""Kelly"" & ""Donna"" (Ronna & Claire) were in the minivan & standing in line at the rave)* Sunset Sky - ""Blackout"" (when Claire was walking to the restaurant before meeting Todd Gaines)These are perfect examples of 1999-era trance that would have made the soundtrack significantly better. Thus, the two stars recommendation..."
1,OMG what a waste of time and money!!,"Well first let me say this software came with my Deluo USB GPS as part of the package. The GPS is great and worth every penny I paid, but the Street Finder software is not worth the CD it was burned on!! The maps are old and out dated, the user interface was written by someone who obviously really could care less about easy of use, and the trip routing was the worst I have ever had the displeasure of using. Please save yourself the brain aneurism that this will cause you while trying to configure and use for your next vacation or trip and get Microsoft Streets & Trips 04. I can't stress enough how utterly horrible Rand McNally Street Finder is. Amazon has a great price on Microsoft Streets and Trips 04 and there's a $10.00 MIR to boot."
1,"Way out of date, incompetent, incoherent","I have been using streets & trips 2001 for a few years, but found it getting incresingly out of date, with the new construction going on around my locale, so I went out and bought this product. Unbelievably, though I bought it at least three years after microsoft streets & trips, it was even MORE out of date -- and the interface looks more dated. Worst of all, the very street I live on -- which has been here at least 10 years now, probably more -- was shown incorrectly, it is a through street, this program shows it as a dead end!In short - a way out of date competitors product you can buy on ebay for $3 is better than this piece of ####. It isn't even worth the time spent installing it (I had to swap the same CD in and out at least 5 times -- what's with THAT?), let alone what3ever money you pay. I'm deleting it off my drive & going back to S&T; 2001 for now."
1,Really Really Bad Product!!!,"Can find a lot of places. Can't find my work, school (University of North Florida!). Although GPS capabilities were okay. But what can I do with GPS if it can't find where I want to go!!!"
4,Very useful for recording GPS data in ASCII format,"I've used this software since version 1998, almost in all North and South America Countries, and it has been very useful to me. I use it connected to my Magellan GPS and my laptop while driving. Using the Monitor and Record funtionality, I get all NMEA data from the GPS in TXT format from where I can extract all kinds of information I need. This feature is not found in other similar software products."
1,Not worth even one star!,"i bought this program after the salesman told me it was the best one he had. What a joke. The search engine is the worst! When you print out a map, it prints it in a color that doesn't allow you to see the streets. b What good is that. I emailed the company and they said you cannot change the default color of the map in this version. What a screw up that is! I am so disappointed that I uninstalled it and just use mapquest now. I can't belive Rand McNally allowed a program this bad to be released. Someone must have been snoozin'"
5,Handy tool for an advisor,"Dealing with couples exhibiting different backgrounds and attitudes towards money, and finances in general, is a challenge. Olivia Mellan has developed a strategy and a book that gauges people's money styles and addresses the need to recognize and how to adapt to each other's differences. I found this an important, basic tool that needed to be in my library, and in my toolkit as an fee-only financial advisor who works with couples."
1,Worst product I have ever used,"They have changed the formula and this one comes off on everything. It has ruined a set of sheets and it washes off in the pool. The old product was the greatest I had ever used, but this is horrible"
5,Birthday Gift,"I purchased these for my daughter to bring to a 7th birthday party and they were a big hit. We purchase a lot of Melissa and Doug products; they are sturdy, well made and fun!"
5,Great White North,This is a most excellent album. These Dudes are totally funny. I would also totally recommend SCTV and their movie strage brew.
1,This is garbage,My god how dimiwtted do people have to be to laugh at this??? I mean canadian jolks or american jolks can be funny but this one is just dumb and gets annoying by trakc 3.
5,"Great White North is Pretty Great, Eh?","Bob and Doug hilariously try to sing and instead bungle their way through one peculiarity after another, leaving you with a series of grins, giggles and even a couple of belly laughs. Donuts, Beer and their over-the-top stereo-type of our dear friends to the north will brighten your day, and teach you some new songs you won't soon forget. A+"
4,Becky bondage's greatest hits,Jsut recently i saw vice squad play. They were the first band that i ever saw live. They made me realize what the whole punk scene was about. This album reconizes what an awesome person Becky Bondage really is and what Vice Squad is really all about. The first song i ever heard from them wsa teenage rampage and from then on i loved them. Teenage rampage i am very glad is on this album because that is the song that everyone knows. Hopefully if people buy this c.d for that song they will listen to the otjhers and see how gerat vice squad really is.
4,I prefer the bars,"Have been drinking this shake for many years. Although they are great and deserve 5 stars, I recently ran out and ended up purchasing bars. The bars offer so much more flexibility and convenience. Not to mention the amazing taste. I have stopped using the powder formulationa nd use only the bars."
3,good,"Excellent service, and packaging is excellent. And excellent quality and sent on timeMy advice to deal with themMy advice to deal with them"
2,Not Impressed,Hmmm. My Mother drinks these so I thought I would try it. However there is no way I could drink these every day.
1,It Must Fly First Class,Shipping charge is $8.19 for a $16.00 product that weighs less than 2 pounds. This vendor should be avoided.
5,Preparation Tip,"I love this for breakfast even when I'm not dieting and I've found the optimum way to prepare it (for myself, anyway) and thought I'd pass it along: you put skim milk in a shaker (use one with measuring marks on it to get the 8 oz. of milk lined up right), add the scoop of S-F, then a couple of ice cubes. Shake it like you're making a martini, for a couple of minutes, then pop it into your freezer for about 15 minutes and then use a straw, for that real milkshake feeling! Trust me, it's worth the wait. It comes out thicker and colder and more satisfying than a blender can ever make it. You can adjust the freeze time to your preference or to your particular freezer. Awesomely delicious."
3,Works for a few weeks,"I used slim fast for almost 6 months this year and saw mixed results. I followed the 3-2-1 plan almost religiously and did really well the first few weeks. I quickly dropped 20 pounds, but then saw my results come to a halt. My diet did not change, and I was still exercising, I just was unable to shed any more.The product tastes great, and curbs hunger very well. I had the energy to maintain work outs, but the high carbs meant less protein. After choosing to discontinue the slim fast I switched to a lean protein/low carb diet and was able to regain the ability to lose pounds.For those wanting to lose a few quick pounds, or provide a quick meal when maintaining a healthy weight this product is a good choice. If you have a significant amount to lose you may want to look into another option."
5,just what I needed,"Just what I wanted, not always available in stores, good price and quick delivery. The flavor of the powder with milk from your own refrigerator is much tastier than the canned liquid Slim-Fast in the stores."
5,Great for losing weight!,"I started this around 2 and a half months ago, followed the directions as closely as I could, and I lost 20 pounds so far! It tastes great and it eliminates my cravings for sweets. It says to exercise along with the plan, but I haven't done that, and I didn't need to. Great product!"
4,I like it,"I had planned on using this for breakfast/lunch everyday to aide in weight loss. I did not do that, but every once in a while I'll use it for breakfast/lunch on a weekend and I'll switch between this and cereal for breakfast during the week.If you can stick to it every day for at least breakfast you'll start to notice a bit of a difference. It is pretty healthy for you as far as vitamins go, and I personally enjoy the taste, though the powder doesn't dissolve well in cold milk.I recommend this for anyone looking for a weight loss aide that tastes good. Try heating up the milk in the winter and it will be like hot chocolate for breakfast (and to help dissolve the powder), otherwise the undissolved powder still tastes fine.I got this for about 1/2 of what it normally goes for and it was very worth it, I was finally going to stick to it every day and the price went up, but its still reasonable."
3,Not effective,"After using this for several months now, I can say that its not very effective. It tastes good and makes you want to feel good that you are making a difference to your body, but in a few hours, you wil be hungry again.3-stars for the price, taste and proteins. Other than that, not recommended."
3,regular user,I've used Slim-Fast for years to maintain weight and as a quick breakfast.The product works well with disciplined choices all day.
3,"Does not dissolve well, okay taste",This thing tastes like chocolate milk (if you add milk) but it is hard to dissolve in milk with a spoon. I highly recommend the strawberry because it has no problems dissolving. It must be the cocoa causing the problem.
4,little weight loss,"i use this in place of meals. i know you have to eat at least 4 meals a day but alot of time i'm not hungry so i drink them, i add at times tumeric or a banana to it and drink it down, but to be fair i have given up 90% white, no starch or pasta, after a few days of this you really don't feel that hungry, doing this for 6 mos but cheating weekly i have lost near 30 lbs and feel good, when u have a craving for something have it but dont pig out on it. I bought another brand in vanilla to switch off, after a while you get bored of chocolat. but doing good dropped from a tight 38 to a loose 34. still using it but once a day because i'm where i want to be,, now just maintenance. i feel it helped me, i still have 2 full cans in closet. i also keep bars in glove compartment not to miss a meal when on the go, hope this helps, this is my story"
5,Delicious and quick,The chocolate is delicious and I use it when I've three hour classes or at work! I do not use as much as directed because it is sooooo chocolatey! I use between 1/2-2/3 the scoop and it still leaves me full!
4,Satified customer,"I have been using this product for years. Very satified, especially when I add a banana or other fruit in the blender with the mix.The only proablem is other than Sam's Club and Amazon I haven't been able to find the same size in the stores. The smaller sizes available are more expensive."
4,not a bad tribute,"This is not really a BAD tribute album. It's actually pretty good. There are a few ""dancy"" tracks that i did not like or that i thought that it did not sound too ""Doorsy"" but most the the tracks are good.My fave are Rhea's Obsession version of ""end of the night"" and Neferatu version of ""people are strange""give this album a chance and hear it for yourselves!"
3,It's darkened. But did you have to put it out completely?,"I realized after listening to this tribute album that it was the Doors behind Morrison's lyrics that made the band great so great. I just can't cotton on to this sound. In fairness, this isn't as bad as listening to Scott Stapp (who in character is the very antithesis of Morrison) try and cover the Doors."
1,An insult to Jim Morrison's legacy,"First, let me say I rated this ""one star"" because ""0-stars"" is not available. I perceive this ""recording"" as an insult to Jim Morrison's unique and exceptional poetry, and also to the beautiful musical subtlety and structural elements of the Doors' compositions. I personally believe fans of the Doors will find no use in this CD. ""Goth"" artists just aren't the proper group to remix these masterpieces. Judge for yourself, however."
1,"THIS IS A VAPID, EMPTY ALBUM","THIS A VERY SORRY TRIBUTE NOT ONLY MORRISON, BUT TO THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES MUSICIANS WOLRD WIDE. LOOK AT THIS ALBUM ONCE ON THIS WEB SITE, AND JUST MOVE ON, AND DEVOTE NO MENTAL ENERGY THAN THAT. IT'S THAT BAD"
1,Dark vs Bleek vs Mainstream...,"If one's opinion is - the Doors' music is optimumly construed or otherwise by Gothic style of music, one then simply likes Gothic style. However, Gothic is a drone IMO i.e., Hellfire. They've taken the music from 'dark' to 'bleek'and more boring.More than likely, ""Touch Me"" with Chrissie Hynde will blow the drone interpretation away! Ah, this rockin' mainstreamer <--NOT, Chrissie, is what rock is fundamentally all about, and given the Pretenders' cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Roomful Of Mirrors, it'll be right on! I'll choose ""Touch Me"" from the covers right now.No one else can do Peace Frog nor Soft Parade like the Doors - that's an absolute! And, not all Doors' music is that entertaining nor meaningful anyway so if one likes droning so be it, but if one likes rock 'n' roll, go for Chrissie, and perhaps the other so called 'mainstreamers' will have grasped the idea, not like Gothic - simply picking up on the dark element of the Doors turning it into drone."
2,Disappointing,"Well, I had recently got the vinyl EP of ""Love, pusscats and carwrecks"", which I really dug, so I checked out the CD of ""Million Pounds"". Most of the CD did not live up to my expectations - it just doesn't groove as well. I know the sound for Funki Porcini (and for much of the Ninja Tune catalog)is generally more disconnected as the samples sort of collide with each other, but I found it to be less pleasurable and more annoying on this outing. I ended up scarching my head more than i was nodding it."
3,Good enough,"It's a dish rack. It holds dishes and seems sturdy enough to last a while. Not a lot to say about it except to note that the large hole at one end, previously mentioned by others, is very odd. Not a big problem, but strange.Can't get excited about it, but would purchase again if the need arose."
3,Could be better,I like this style of dish drainer but would have liked the item better if it were made of heavier material and I would prefer the utensil holder to be squared off and not rounded. The utensils slide up with the rounded bottom. I don't use it daily so the product serves the purpose for which it was purchased.
2,this video needs help,"my son has been a fan of the story ""swimmy"" so we were looking forward to this video. although the animation is interesting (a bit like eric carle), the soundtrack for this video is the worst! it reminded me of the audio portion of my 5th grade science class slide show. it is all muffled and wobbly and sounds warped. also, the narration for ""swimmy"" was different than the story and it confused my son. what a disappointment."
3,Not like the EZD I have at home,"I bought this item because my kids' school binders always break. This binder had the same item number (79362), description, and name as a binder I have at home, which has really heavy rings. I thought, ""Perfect, something that will last and at a great price!"" (I paid quite a bit more for the ones I have at home.) When this binder came, I saw the rings were the regular thickness. They will end up bending like the others we had. Unlike the Avery EZD binder I have already, it does not say EZD, it just says One Touch. I don't know if Avery changed the product or Amazon got a cheap replacement (this is made in Mexico). I am returning this item. Two inches of paper on thin rings will last my kids a month. No thanks!"
2,"Some good features, but not perfect","The first time I took this binder off the shelf, I was glad to find it held a number of women already stocked (I think my friend, who works for a women's group, must have done that). The fact that it's 2 inches thick certainly helped, as my collection includes at least twice as many as those in 1-inch binders. Unfortunately, though, the one touch ring is so simple that it's easy to accidentally open, as I did at one point, and all my women immediately escaped. Who would've guessed they wanted to see life outside the domestic confines of binderly bliss?"
5,What A Surprise!!,"I was a little bit skeptical when I purchased this dvd - something called Chickfight was something i was hesitant to buy, but I was completely surprised. This dvd set is awesome. I have been down on women's wrestling because of how poor most of the fem wrestlers are on wwe programming. The women on this dvd are real wrestlers - not good looking models made into wrestlers. Allison Danger, Lacey, Cheerleader Melissa and especially Mschif are fantastic - the matches are very exciting, not to mention how good looking the ladies are. I don't think I have been this hard during a wrestling dvd in quite some time. I highly recommend it!!"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This is in NO way shape or form underground wrestling..the way they sell this is to make it sound alot more than it is..don't buy the hipe..I watched these and it is all scripted..this is as fake as it gets..it takes place in a down stairs rink.. by the looks of it , it's at the boys club or something on that sorts..The wrestlin was ok..but if your expecting to see T&A; you wont see it..at this price it's a con..Do yourself a favor and just record WWE, you will be much better entertained...then this crap"
1,Save your money....,Had this camera for one hour...took one picture and the thing stopped working. Their customer service is barely ever there & they do not answer inquiries or concerns in a timely manner.You're better off saving your money...it has a one year warranty but it's really not worth the time and frustration of trying to figure out to use it & you have no support if you have a problem. Save your money and spend a little more for a better known name brand camera.
1,Camera is Awful,I agree with everybody else. I got a replacement camera after the first quit working after about 3 pictures were taken (that were indeed bad quality anyway). Sakar did send replacement but did the same thing exactly as the first one. Bad thing is my son who is on deployment ordered it over the internet thru Toys 'R Us for his little sister on HIS credit card so we don't know how or if we can get his money back for it. I will GLADLY send the camera back if my son can get his money back.
1,Why is Toys R Us Still Selling This Piece of Junk?,"Why is Toys R Us still selling this piece of junk. The camera does not work. It takes forever for the camera to take a picture. The picture comes out to dark if you are not using the flash, or it is white-washed if you are using the flash. It burns through a set of batteries after a few flash photographs. My child got frustrated with it. Avoid at all costs!"
1,Junk,"I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased this camera. When it did work it took terrible pictures. The color and clarity of the photos were horrible. It does eat up batteries, but that doesn't make any difference now because the camera doesn't work.I entered a review earlier and would like to add to it. Though the camera is horrible, and stopped working after two days, I did recieve a new camera through Sakar even though I didn't have a reciept. Now I'm stuck witht the same bad camera. Anybody want to buy one?"
1,Doesn't work,"Like all the other reviews, we have had the same problems. It seems as if the batteries are not working after only one picture. The flash did not provide any additional light at all. A waste of money and very disappointing to the child who received it."
1,MEGA PIXEL DIGITAL CAMERA,you take one picture and it breaks down. it gets so boring and you never use when it is working.
2,Consistently Boring,"I cannot recommend this album.Unless you really want to hear Raekwon spit, its not worth it. The MCs of Ice Water are all mediocre and do not have unique style/flow/delivery or lyrics. I can't help but not be impressed.I only slightly like 2 songs among the 17. Hip-Hop Tribute is an OK song, aside from the one sided flow from Ice Water. Raekwon delivers on this track, his best on the album (IMO). Thats the Raekwon flow I know and love. Basically all the rest of Raekwon's flow lacks that shine. I know Raekwon can spit some fire so I was kinda taken back... I hope he saved his best for Cuban Linx II and 8 Diagrams.The album as a whole is scattered and non-cohesive. Production was in between not very good and decent. The only guest MC I liked was Busta, who spit some classic style. Im just glad my friend burned it for me, and I didn't waste my own money."
2,Where's the mistery? Where's the thrill?,"I was looking forward to reading this book once I saw the incredible comments about it: ""brilliant"", ""amazing"", ""a dazzling achievement"", ""a new departure for the American novel"". But what a waste of money... Not only was the book dull and obvious, but it was also pretentious. Do not expect to find anything similar to a mistery novel or even a detective story. It's about a writer (yes, so original) who clearly doesn't know what to do with his life. So, he decides that pretending to be a detective is a good way of spending his time."
3,Do you like confusing puzzles?,"If you like a conundrum with no clear answers, you might like this book. I found it well-written, but not the type of novel I generally enjoy reading: gauzy, strange, nonsensical in places. The third in the trilogy is by far the best, in my opinion, so if you're tempted to give up, hang in there."
3,Austers postmodernist fiction transcends genre definitions.,"I am writing my final thesis for my masters degree on Paul Austers New York Trilogy and I would love to hear from anyone interested in his work (The Locked Room is of special interest to me). At the time N.Y. Trilogy was published it had a great impact on me. Now almost 15 years later I can still read the book with great pleasure. One of Austers best books yet. Compares easily with ""Leaviathan"" and is without doubt a more thorougly thougt thought book than his latest work of fiction ""Timbuktu"". I can recomend it to anyone who likes a kafkesque atmosphere in their reading."
3,Eh. Good stories but they felt like a cop out.,"His writing is amazing, his characters are fascinating... the first story really held me, even though it felt at times like I was reading a school report on the history of language instead of a short story. And then came the end of the first story, which--not in that the story is unfinished, but the way it's written--left me wholly unsatisfied. i plowed through to the next one, and was again fascinated by the character and the story--again to find the ending unsatisfying. i skimmed the last story.i'd recommend it if you have a lot of time on your hands or are really intrigued by character studies (although the three protaganists seemed to have a similar voice, after a while)."
4,"Great book, horrible binding","Just want to add, beyond any comment on the material inside, that the binding is horrible for Penguin paperbacks, meaning that the pages are not evenly cut and stick in all directions at the end of the page starting from the glued part. Every Penguin paperback I've ordered from Amazon suffers from this..."
1,Useless,"Needed this book for a class, however, it was not the same version that is pictured and would have left me clueless to which page the rest of the class was on. But took so long to ship that I ended up buying the correct copy. At least change your photo to the book version that you will be sending. Wouldn't have wasted my time otherwise."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I was given this trilogy as a gift, and sadly I have stopped reading it after the first book. I didn't find the main character in the first book very believable, in that he seemed to be rationally driven, but at every step he made such stupid mistakes.I also found Auster rambles on and on for pages at times on topics that are only loosely connected with the storyline. This can often be done well, but he does it by telling rather than by showing, which I find to be one of the biggest differences between a good book and a bad one.I was quite surprised at the many positive things I've heard about this book. I suppose it just wasn't for me."
2,Weak Modernist Take on Noire Novella,"Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws."
2,pseudo,"I might be ignorant, but this book didn't appeal to me at all. I read it during my summer holidays, and it wasn't bad entertainment. However, I don't like the plot of the three stories, and especially City of Glass is a bit too ""pseudo"". Some passages are like reading Umberto Eco, but without his brilliance and more important without importance to me as the reader!I rate this book 2 stars; 1 for Auster's writing, which (without doubt) is good ,and 1 for his description of New York. I've never had the pleasure to visit the city, but in this book it comes alive.My conclusion will be: If you want mystery novels stick to Raymond Chandler, and if you want the rest stick to Umberto Eco ;-)"
2,rather disappointing,"Having read and immensely enjoyed Paul Auster's The Brooklyn Follies, and considering the almost uniformly positive reviews that The New York Trilogy gets from readers and critics alike, I guess I was bound to be disappointed. Auster just seems to try too hard here. The stories are surrealist, which I usually enjoy, but don't make any sense at all. You get to the end of each one and you think: ""what was that all about?"" (Yes, it is obviously possible that I just ""don't get it,"" but neither might you...) There are occasional cross-references among the three stories, and even those don't make any sense in the context of each individual narrative. In my opinion the third entry in the book is almost salvageable, but even that one will likely disappoint the reader given the non-ending sort of ending. Paul, have you written something better lately? I know you have it in you."
1,Poor!,"This is a 'clever' trilogy - the same story is used three times, with slightly different 'clothing'. As the 'plot' is desperately bleak and pointless, I do not recommend it."
4,Freaky but good,Paul Auster can kind of creep me out but it's like a car accident that you just can't help slowing down to see.
4,A Mind-bending Work,This is a breathtaking and surreal book. The most interesting aspect to Auster's work is that he frequently haunts a reader for years after he or she finishes one of his novels. These stories do not disappoint and will surely change how one sees writing and the world.
2,Was not impressed,I read this book because I loved Paul Aster's Brooklyn Follies. This compilation of 3 short stories may have well been written by a completely different author. They are short detective stories that are slightly intertwined. I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it.
3,not a real detective story BY BROWNY,"We were suposed to read ""City of Glass"" out of Auster's NEW YORK TRILOGY in our English advanced class. I believe the mystery of chance and the multiple personalities of the protagonist are crucial for Austers first detective story. The well chosen setting fits perfectly into the plot. Auster writes about an isolated , lonely writer at the mid-thirty, who has pleasant success in writing detective stories. Just by accident the protagonist gets the opportunity to solve an obscure case as an pseudo-detetective. It is easy to follow the plot, but somehow the reader happens to mix up the charachters. But you will never be bored while reading it, even though there are parts of the story wiht not much suspense."
2,Not my style,"When you read a book and whatever you are reading doesn't say anything is a waist of time, half of this book is written that way, maybe the stories are good, but when you read and read and nothing happen or explain things that you already know (Like all the names of the streets in NY city) I said that the grass is to green, why? Because everybody knows that the grass is green, you don't have to read it in a book, reading these kind of ""grass"" makes the story boring and you don't want to know what will happen in the real story of the book, this is a really waste of time, paper and money for this book."
1,Poor Quality Product!,This charger and a battery came with my trimmer. I have had the charger for about 18 months now and it has stopped working. My experience is consistent with the other reviewers regarding how short the life of this charger is. I just checked B&D's Web site and I don't see this charger listed. Hopefully that means they have stopped making it!
3,18V Battery Charger,"I ordered an 18V Black & Decker battery charger for my cordless drill. I received a 14V charger. Oddly enough, even the order slip said 18V. Luckily the output on the charger was very similar and all I had to do was make a notch on the other side of the charger where it clips onto the batteries so that it would work. Other than that one slight mistake in sending the wrong product, it works very well."
3,john,not a good review i was sent the wrong charger.had to send it back. it coast me more money .and time wasted .not good. john
4,Excellent buy,I purchased 2 chargers one for my husband and 1 for his friend (we accidently killed his charger). Both are very happy with the product and the delivery of the item.
1,Broken after 1 recharge,"I wouldn't waste your time buying this product. It work once great, and then that was it..."
1,does not work at all,This simply does not work. Does not charge either of the batteries for my blower which I know are not bad.
5,well satisfied,"good vendor, prompt service product as described,value / cost effective and as quoted / no surprises, no negative experiences, i would use this vendor again"
2,B&C battery charger #5103069,"My Grass hog grass trimmer is just about 2 years old. The trimmer itself is quite good and uses much less string that others we have owned. However, the charger has now failed. I actually put a meter on it found it was putting out 1.8 volts instead of 18 volts and the red light never comes on anymore. I was able to use the charger for my B&D electric drill of same voltage and it is now successfully charging the trimmer batteries. I checked the output of my old charger at 19.0 volts. Of all my battery operated tools, this is the cheapest design charger I have ever seen. I found prices from $14.55 to $24.00, which is honestly about $10 to $15 more than it should be. I am going to contact B&D to ask why so many reviews are negative and ask too if they have an improved model available."
1,Replacement,"This purchase was made to replace the original charger that came with a B&D; hard surface blower. Original was only a couple years old. It wasn't dropped, or exposed to rough service. It just quit working. Consequently,the only reason I replaced it was because it was cheaper to do so vs buying new product from different manufacturer. (Two batteries and blower still work fine)"
4,Husband needed one,"the Black & Decker batteries seem to die faster than the equipment, so we are always looking to good deals on batteries since my husband uses the equipment daily. Good price."
4,Black and Decker 18 Volt Battery Charger,"Finallly found just what I needed, inexpensive and now I can keep both batteriesthat came with the weed wacker charged...saves time.I will continue to use this until I can afford that fancy one that I haveseen on TV...that will have to wait."
4,Black & Decker battery charger,I needed another charger for the 4 batteries I use in my battery powered weed wacker. This was exactly what I neededand has worked perfectly since I got it. It charges my batteries faster than the original and arrived when I was ready to trim the large lawn. Now I do not worry about whether I will run out of charged batteries.
4,Batteries - good buy,This was a good buy - have an AT&T 4 handset phone and would have had to buy a whole new system if I didn't get these batteries for good price! thank you!
5,Did exactly what I needed it to do,"This charger did exactly what I needed it to do, nothing more, nothing less. It brought an otherwise dead drill back from the ashes, and actually seems a little faster on putting a full charge on the battery."
1,"Original Charger - Hardly used, Doesn't Work","Need I say more? Bought a new battery, thinking I had just not used the original one enough and maybe it had depleted too long, but nope, its the charger. Now I am out over $50 - an amount that would practically BUY the whole unit I am trying to get working (Hedgehog Trimmer). SO next I will get the charger and hope it works better than the bad reviews some gave it on here.Black and Decker: Great Ideas - Poor Application."
4,Your Basic 18V Charger,I bought this charger after purchasing more batteries for my B&D yard tools. It works just like its supposed to- takes about 8 hours to fully charge. Its a good value for a charger. Now I can charge all 7 of my batteries at the same time with 7 individual battery chargers.
3,Quality Somewhat Disappointing...,"Found the product use life about 2 seasons of cutting lawns and trimming. I have an array of B&D tools, have several chargers & half dozen batteries. Found that batteries & chargers last about the same and I find it difficult to determine if it's the charger or the battery that is bad. I guess I expected more from the B&D accessories as I find the power tools a great help in maintaining my home and lawn."
1,All three of mine have gone bad.,"I have three and they worked for over a year; then all went bad at about the same time. I have three because I own Black & Decker circular saws, recip. saws, drills, a sander, a weed trimmer, etc., all using the 18 volt system."
1,Waste of time and money!!!!,"Don""t buy this!!! It is unreliable!!I have only used this charger three times to charge the batteries that came with my grasshog weedeater. Now it has died and I have three batteries and a weedeater that I can't use because B&D; puts out such a horrible charger with their tools. What a collossal waste of my money!I thought it would be nice to be able to just throw a battery on my grasshog and trim the lawn whenever convenient but I have learned my lesson. Anyone need three 18 volt batteries for their trimmer?????"
1,Two Failed,Two of these OEM units failed within a couple weeks. One was about three years old; the other about four months. The newer was replaced under warranty with a different model that is supposed to be more reliable: ETPCA-180021U2.
3,Poor Charger Life,"My 18V battery died and I replaced it. However, then I found out the charger was also defective. So I had to replace it too. I felt it should have lasted longer since it wasn't used excessively."
2,return,I got product all right it was not what I needed so I returned it and I am still waiting for a return on my money 4 weeks later.P.S. I paid for it promptly
5,Great replacement item,"Had two chargers, both gave out and still had equipment that used these batteries, so a replacement charger--at a decent price--was needed. This works!"
3,"Works okay, just don't use it to trickle charge during the week.","This charger, one of the worst B&D makes, will charge NiACds just fine, as long as you remove the battery when it's charged. The reason I took 2 stars off was that the slowly-dimming red LED makes it difficult to determine when the battery is charged. Mine never quite go out, then just keep getting dimmer. The other slow charger B&D makes, with a smaller connector and a green LED, works much better for this."
5,Good Buy,This is just what I needed! It works wonderful and holds the charger in just right. Wonderful if you need a replacement! Great shipping as well!
5,Works!,"With this extra charger, I can now charge two batteries at the same. This has saved me the headache of not being able to charge the second battery when I really need it."
1,junk junk junk don't buy,"we bought this item, it worked for two months, then wouldn't charge, now a replacement costs 40 dollars, I don't think so when the trimmer cost $50this is a bad product that does not last, I DO NOT recommend it. Waste of money. Purchased at Sears, very unhappy."
4,JR,The only thing this doesn't have that the origanal charger has is the test light. It works great for the second battery that came with the Black & Decker cordless broom. Now I have 2 batteries charged all the time. It doubles my time when blowing things off.Well worth the money. JR
5,Great time-saver,"Having several of these chargers is a godsend! I have several Black & Decker yard tools that all utilize the battery that fits these chargers and a battery comes with each charger. SO, by having multiple chargers, I can have all the batteries fully charged at all times. This is crucial since I run through about 3-4 battery charges each time I tend my yard. Now I don't have to wait for those extra batteries to charge; I can merely pop in the next battery that's waiting fully charged! I keep 5 of these bad boys working at all times for ""just in case."" The fact that they're much less expensive than buying another tool just for the sake of another battery charger and battery is also great."
5,Yes!,This CD just blows me away each time I hear it. Definitely one of the best CDs in my collection. This man reaches out to the very core of your soul...
4,"Attention to detail, wins.",First let me say a little about the author. I own five books by Burral Paye. I also own over 60 videos and 30 books on coaching basketball. Coach Paye pays attention to detail like no other. Things which you and I may take for granted are included in every book of Paye's I have read. With this let me say a little about the book listed. As usual Coach Paye is very thorough. The system is based on a sound philosophy. Any coach using this system needs to have it in place at lower levels of his program. Without this it would be difficult to teach the whole system. Though many parts of this sytem can be implemented in a single season. Coach Paye also addresses this in his book. If you are a pressing coach and have a good feeder program this book will be a valuable resource.
5,Sumptuous Melodies,"I stumbled onto this band years ago and was blown away by their sound. It's an upbeat blend of the Cuban ""son"" rhythm with the traditional Wolof and Mandinka melodies. I honestly don't think I have ever heard anything so incredible.It's one of my Top Ten CD's - of all time. I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought this CD was an inferior Baobob album. Yeah, it's true that the ""Pirate's Choice"" CD is their best, but it's hard to find (that's why I chose to review this one; you can find it at ANY. . . store). That said, this CD is STILL an epiphany!"
4,The 'All Styles' reunion CD is great but ...,"The first time I heard 'Boulmamine,' from this CD reissue of two OB vinyl-era albums, I was stopped in my tracks. The animistic vibe, the flow of the band and the temple-of-reverb sound were, taken together, unlike anything I'd ever heard in Afro-Cuban music. I imagined OB having these intense yet congenial recording sessions in a dusty church of a studio. The rest of this CD sustains the beautiful spirit of that one incredible song."
5,Black Current Preserves from Scotland,"This item was chosen as a gift for my brother who recently returned from a trip to Scotland and raved about these particular Black Current Preserves. He was unable to bring back a jar in his suitcase due to limited space. I just went to Amazon.com, did a quick search and found this product easy as pie! It made a great early Christmas gift and pleased my brother so much! He said every time he ate some it brought back memories of his trip to Scotland. This product was perfect and the entire experience more than met my expectations."
3,"good, but money better invested in online prep","I can not recommend investing in the QBook, as I still found it necessary to buy the online QBank in order to prepare adequately. Although the questions are not bad to review, they don't seem too similar to the real USMLE questions."
3,interesting but limited,"I am glad that Sandy Johnson wrote this book. It is engaging, interesting reading. But it is a bit thin, which is frustrating. It would be a better book if she had gone into more depth about each healer. Nevertheless, I am glad she has written what she has. The more information about extraordinary people like these, the better."
4,Great performance but not terribly durable,"The performance of this fitting is considerably better than comparable units found at the major brick and mortar home improvement stores. I bought two initially and experienced no leaks. Due to the thin brass they are not very durable. After a few months of normal use, the edge of one has bent in slightly and will no longer screw onto a hose.I still like them enough that I just bought two more."
3,Mike's own,"Photo not large enough. Is this a fish tank? Does it come with ahood? It appears that ( by the pic ) It is a 180 gallon fish tankwith a black hood? I am interested in buying this product.This is a good value, and it looks very nice."
5,Set in Victorian London,"The year is 1888, the place is Whitechapel, London. Set during the reign of terror caused by Jack the Ripper murdering prostitutes. Rhiannon Moore was forced into prostitution to survive after the suicide of her father. One night she is attacked and saved from death by Lady Evangeline St. Claire. Lina takes Rhiannon under her wing and together they begin a race against time to prevent the infamous Jack the Ripper committing more murders. Along the way Rhiannon and Lina fall in love thus complicating their investigations.I really enjoyed this book. The descriptions of Victorian London was very vivid. This is the first book I've read by Nene Adams. I'm looking forward now to reading the next in the series."
4,CD One Is Fantastic,"I bought disc one back in 1989 and then the full set of 5 CDs back in the mid 1990's. None of these are guided meditations. CD #1 has a sound frequency that can get you into a very deep meditative state. There is a lot of backround sound like water and bells but just focus on the hummmm. Concentrate on your 3rd eye forehead center (ajna for yoga experts) and lie on your back. See my review o the book ""Methods of Psychic Development"". Use the 2 together for peaceful deep states of consciousness. I have tried the other 4 CDs and I don't get as good results with them as with CD #1. CD #1 can get you into the Theta brain wave resonance which is where you want to be for brain refreshment and positive psychic experiences. I feel it's worth the money. If you don't try to concentrate a little on your ajna center you might miss the benefit."
3,A wickedly clever little novel,"Pre-World War I Adolph Hitler is a total incompetant. Young Adolph comes to Liverpool to live with his brother Alois & his Irish wife. He is to helps his brother in his new business. But he cannot do anything right. He is depressed & paranoid. A total loser. It is a funny book, fiction yet chilling because we all know what really happened."
2,um.....,"This was a strange little story set in Liverpool, England before the outbreak of the Great War when young Adolf was 23 years old. It is based on the little-known ""fact"" that Hitler visited his half brother in England from November 1912 to April 1913. The book was definitely imaginative but too fictitious to be taken seriously. Don't expect to learn much about the young Hitler from this book."
4,Great Wallet,"I love this - I use it as a full wallet and it keeps me from carrying a bunch of unnecessary junk. The case will pick up small scratches and minor ""dings"" but is tough. If you carry little or not cash it will work fine -I keep 5 credit cards and a paper insurance card on one side - on the other side I carry two paper insurance cards, one credit card, four business cards, and five paper money bills (the bills are folded-over twice into quarters to fit and thus four times as thick).The elastic straps are durable but I have to re-fasten them about once a week during normal use."
5,"Like the title says, ""Classics""","Patty Loveless is the type of artist who gets into your heart and soul with her music. The ""Classic"" tracks run the gamut from the achingly beautiful and haunting ""Here I Am"", to the upbeat bouncy ""I Think About Elvis."" The three new cuts, are Loveless at her finest. With ""Can't Get Enough,"" Sassy, flirty Patty takes us dancin', The Duet ""My Kind of Woman/My Kind of Man"" with Vince Gill is a classic country duet in it's own right. ""I Just Wanna Be Loved By You"" is almost bluesy but still all Patty Loveless. In all the tracks, the fine touch of Emory Gordy Jr. is evident. The music never overpowers, but always counterpoints and supports Patty's vocals. ""Classics"" may be a 'greatest hits' compilation, but if you like class, then this is a must for any collection."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I think Patty Loveless is one of country music's great divas of all time. ""Classics"" certainly proves this fact. Patty has such a pure and ""down-home country"" voice. I just love her twang! My favorite song on this CD is ""Lonely Too Long"". I listen to it all the time and could NEVER get tired of hearing it! I also like ""You Don't Seem To Miss Me"", ""Can't Get Enough"", ""How Can I Help You Say Goodbye"", ""My Kind of Woman, My Kind of Man"", ""You Can Feel Bad"", and ""I Just Wanna Be Loved By You"". Every song on here is great! Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!"
5,The Best Singer,"I Feel Patty Loveless Is One Of (The Best Soul Singer's In Bluegass & Country Musice In The Bluegass State Of Ky) She is In The Song She Is Singing & The Song Is In Her. If You Can,t Get Filling Out Of A Song Whil You Are Singing You Can not Reach Out To People AS You Should. I Pray God Will Contines Blessing You. Paul Varney."
4,Incredibly Abrasive,"""Jesus Built My Hotrod"" is one of those rare examples in rock where the song is just as good as the title. A fast and furious blend of industrial and speed metal, Al Jourgensen's single is loud, abrasive, and a whole lotta fun. We get the single edit and the 12-inch extended version. For best results, play this single at full blast while severely intoxicated."
5,So encouraging,"This is a very easy read. Buy two copies and give one to a friend or family member who is struggling with the ""bumps"" of live. There's something in it for everybody."
5,Great metaphor!,"Great message. Loving the mountains and hiking, I was drawn to the title immediately. Having a boys' ranch, I see alot of discouragment in young men's lives. This is a great devotional book for guys of all ages. This book is full of encouragment and great life lessons."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The 2 min. piece they show you for free is cute.But overall this is the worst 9 minutes of garbage I have ever seen.What's with the little black child dancing on a table and taking his clothes off while 3 white ""soldiers"" watch. Not cute!Hugging one soldier while full frontal long kiss on the mouth with another soldier behind his back by Shirley. Not cute!!And at the end where one ""soldier"" is picking his teeth with Shirley's diaper pin? Not cute!!!Someone produced this garbage and wants your money. Not cool!!!"
2,So-so as collectors go...,"Lots of information... Not many photos. Mostly line drawings. Instead of going in chronilogical order, he goes by parts... Stock, sights, barrel, etc. This is very difficult to try to date any weapons. I think the book was written because most Nagants are made up of parts from various years. Still, I think it would be nice if he had started with photos of the earliest model versions and then discussed all the various parts. Just an opinion."
4,"good reference book, short on history","A great book for the serious collector, but short on information for the beginner. Good pictures and drawingsWould have liked more background on particular versions."
3,Could be a Repport - too long...,"They could have written a repport with the material. It is good, has good insights, but far extensive than necessary."
5,business as a human(e) activity,"Everyone knows how important attention is, but few business thinkers have had the courage or follow-through and take on the topic in a management-focused way before. I expected the book to focus more on advertising and Hollywood. Thankfully it didn't. The book's freshness and originality lies in the fact that it shows the relationship between attention and business to be far more extensive than just found in those ""attention industries."" On that note, the chapters on leadership and organizational structure were particularly fresh.Davenport has a knack for forecasting where business is going; he was a pioneer in the Reengineering and Knowledge Management trends. In predicting and setting the direction of both of these, he had a keen sense for the ""human side"" of things. This is the case here as well: in AE he starts with that uniquely human activity-attention-and shows how it can be managed for success in the business world."
2,Not enough,"This book contained a lot of preliminary material describing attention and providing one measurement technique developed at the author's workplace, Accenture. From that point on, all problems were dealt with using this one technique. This book provided no useful ideas for managing attention better.If you want an intro to attention, this book isn't too bad, but if you're looking for a book with practical ways to help you manage how your attention is distributed, look elsewhere."
5,Attention-getting and fun,"This book practices what it preaches! It's written in a light and occasionally funny style, has a really interesting and colorful format, and a very attention-getting cover. I found it to have lots of easy-to-use tips on how to get and keep attention. And the web site for the book - www.attentionbook.com - lets you measure and analyze how your own attention is allocated. It's an entirely new way of looking at business, and I can't stop thinking about attention now!"
4,Thrilling,"It is a very well written novel in which a newspaper story is very well described with all the details. I liked the hero Robert very much, because he is a kind, warm-hearted person. He doesn't need to show everybody how he is and what he can do. But his kindness is the actually reason for all this grief and tragedy in this book. Jenny, a nice girl who believes that her life tragically marred, is also a very good character. The main subject in this novel is death, which is always mentioned in the course of the story. Quite a remarkable thing is the fact that the persons always guess what the other characters do or even think. The owl is the most important symbol in this novel, although it is mentioned very little. But it is a very important, because in the whole story it plays quite an important part. I liked this novel by Patricia Highsmith very much."
1,One of Hightsmith's weakest novels,"Only the equally dull and equally intolerable THIS SWEET SICKNESS, of novels published in Highsmith's lifetime, is weaker. Robert Forester, protagonist, is more symbol than human being, as is sad Jenny and crazy Greg, each seemingly trapped, with a host of other non-entities, in Langley, PA. The book is written in prose flatter than Twiggy (remember her?). The work also a not-too-subtle condemnation of small town parochialism--towns of the hinterland that will protect their own, even murderers, but do-in strangers, like Forester, in a Los Angeles minute...The novel becomes almost funny, or rather, pathetic. To think that Forester (he ""forests'"" death) would care what happens to evil Nickie, his ex, or to Greg, his would-be murderer, strains verisimilitude. The whole bolus a bosh and a bore; rediculous...Why Highsmith biographer Joan Schenkar (THE TALENTED MISS HIGHSMITH) rates the novel one of her favorites is beyond understanding of this reviewer."
2,Too slow,This author's writing is not what I expected. Too slow and the characters are undeveloped. You can not relate to the people the story is about and it leaves you indifferent and bored. I did not have the patience and after 100 pages skipped to the end.
2,Nice but too small,"We have limited space on the kitchen counter, so I wanted a small dish drainer. This one is too small. It only securely holds a few tall 16 oz drinking glasses with 2 3/4 inch rims, and only one dinner plate 10 1/2 inches diameter. When I try to put more glasses or dinner plates in the rack, they look like they will fall over and break. The silverware basket is very small also. Fortunately I still have my large Rubbermaid dish drainer which I will use again."
5,Sink Strainer,"I looked for one everywhere, Walmart included, was unable to find one, until I looked on Amazon.com. I think this was the best purchase I've made for the kitchen sink. The small but versatile Dish Drainer is used everyday. I love that it drains directly into the sink. It is functional and extremely useful. Great for small sink and it holds allot of plates, pans, contains and silverware is held separately. Easy to clean too!"
1,I'm stuck in the bathroom,"Since Pantene discontinued MY unscented, pro-v hair glue that I've used forever, I'm now stuck in the bathroom.I had to buy something, so I bought this Consort for men. The excess spray hit the floorand my feet are now permanently glued to the floor. My wife had to bring the wireless laptopin for me to write this review. Oh, I also don't like the stink this spray makes. It may be statedto be unscented, but it has a nauseating smell when it goes on. Other than those two minor issues,the price is good and it does technically work. But, if I'm going to live in the bathroom, there's hardlyany point to spiffing up my hair...there's nobody in here to impress."
5,Truly the BEST OF Eighteen Visions,"Eighteen Vision's sophomore release will BLOW YOUR MIND! The songs are packed with bone-shattering breakdowns and merciless screaming. They really did a good job on this album and sound roughly like old Norma Jean. You'll deeply regret it if you pass up the chance to get this 18V album. It's not like a greatest hits album, but the title stays true. If you're looking for something like their new Obsession album, stay away from this one, because this was when they weren't pop and teenie boppers didnt listen to them. This cd is for when you're pissed off and want to scream your lungs out."
5,Beegie does it again!,"I recently read a review of the tribute to Elvis album written by a jazz fan who said Beegie is not a true jazz piano player, since the Elvis songbook is not worthy of jazz interpretation. On the contrary, the LOVE, ELVIS album is a testament to Beegie's great talent. She plays the selections with outstanding taste in nice and easy swing interpretations, and the arrangements for the trio are excellent. I have all of Beegie's albums, and every disc is a gem. Her latest issue is a tribute to the music of Johhny Mercer. Do not hesitate to pick it up, as well as the Elvis tribute. You won't regret it."
4,nfl standings board,"True football fans will love this. Keep track of your favorite team throughout the year. All 32 teams are represented with magnetic helmets, and when its playoff time you can place 12 teams in the postseason brackets up to the super bowl champion."
4,Covercraft seat cover fits nice - color concern.,"I purchased the the covercraft seat saver for my Silverado pickup. The fit of the cover is nice a bit tight in the back section of the seat but overall fit nice. The color is misleading. I purchased taupe expecting a bit more brown as shown in the picturebit teh color is more beige, tan. the installation is fairly easy and straight forward."
5,Contrapuntal clarity,"These four-hand transcriptions by Brahms of his early orchestral serenades are simply a delight. While the decay of piano tone has the potential durationally to distort melodic lines, that is not a problem with these skillful transcriptions and sparkling performances. The counterpoint, so integral to the enjoyment of Brahms's music, is very clearly delineated. I wouldn't say the piano texture is superior in that regard to the original, merely different, and allows the listener to notice things that might be submerged in an orchestral performance. Both pianists, who appear to have studied in the very location where Brahms composed these serenades, perform beautifully.Highly recommended."
5,"A Different Take on the Serenades, Worth a Listen","I have to add to the chorus in praise of this disc. It's part of a Naxos series of Brahms' four hand piano music, including transcriptions of some of his orchestral works, and this release is perhaps the most interesting and successful of the lot. I've listened to the symphonic transcriptions and found them much less dazzling; the two Serenades, however, work wonderfully well on the keyboard, and Matthies and Kohn play them perfectly. These versions don't supplant the orchestral originals, but as another reviewer noted, in this guise one hears aspects that aren't so evident in the more familiar form. An engaging disc all the way round!"
5,Transformation and Progress,"I am on my way to a continued transformation assisting to Og Mandino's University of Success. I have no doubt that by the time I am through, I will be better than I am today."
5,Inspiring,We love Og Mandino's books. Put your life back in order!Get yourself motivated to do big things! Be inspired to do more!
3,Not-Quite-So-Successful University,"Mandino counsels the reader, via the introduction, to read each and every chapter, in order, preferably at bedtime. While there are several worthwhile chapters [lessons] in this book, the greater number either read as repetitious drivel or are not particularly well written--a particularly frustrating detail when one is tired after a long day and wants to go to sleep. I've nearly finished reading this, and have noticed that some of the later chapters would've made more sense to me if they'd preceded earlier chapters. So, to give the potential reader a more realistic set of expectations, I'd entitle this book ""The Community College of Success""."
5,My go-to cookbook!,"From the lime grilled chicken to the lemon dill twice baked potato, this cookbook is the first one I pull out when looking for something special but not intimidating to make. Now most of the pages are splattered and dog-eared from all the use. Wonderful sidebars with interesting facts and stories too!"
5,One of the most beautiful cookbooks ever printed!,"A hard cover, coffee-table type cookbook with menus and entertaining ideas that represent the ""New South"" Winner of many awards for both quality and content. Highly recommended!!"
3,Nice looking watch but....,I would expect they'd waived the $25 shipping charge because that's the only thing prevents me from buying.
5,Watch vs. world hunger,"I recently came into some money and I was going to set up a fund to ameloriate world hunger, focusing primarily on Africa. I was also going to build a few schools in Cambodia. But then I saw this watch. Oh well."
3,This tank is not waterproof!,"Got the Ladies Tank Francaise for my wife the other day. They are great. However, they are not waterproof, so we had to toss it after a day on the beach."
5,DLOG,I must say after purchasing this watch and saving 15 grand I know can afford to drive my Benz. The gas was costing me a fortune but now with an extra 15 grand it is pure dlog. I recommend this watch to anyone who wants extra money to pay for gas and also did I mention this watch is pure DLOG
1,"this watch is dangerous, y'all","i got this watch from my former second husband kevin--well, actually, i had to pay but we made it look kind of like he got it for me since people have been so MEAN about saying he's a golddigger for marrying me-- he has TALENT, PEOPLE, at least i thought he did until he started going on tour and people threw their beer at him on stage- but anyways i liked this watch he got me but PEOPLE BE WARNED because it is NOT SAFE. I gave it to my baby to play with and he actually started CHOKING on a diamond that came off, y'all. at first i thought maybe kevin had pried it loose to try to sell it but then kevin said he loved me TOO MUCH to do something like that and it was the GLUE GIVING WAY. if you are going to spend this much money on a watch you would expect at least they would use SUPER GLUE, right people????? anyways, y'all, my baby is STILL choking to this very day and I say never again will i buy one of these watches."
5,What a great price!,"WOW! I never thought I would find this at such an unbelieveable price! But I have one thought to share with you - if you have this amount to buy a watch of this price, how about just sending a few $10,000 to me ? You won't even notice it has gone and you probably make the same in interest every day. So how about it then?"
3,"A Little Pricey, But What the Hey...","I usually don't slum around with low priced watches like this, but I thought I'd purchase it as a gag gift for my wife. I know, I could've donated that money to a charity and fed a bunch of starving kids, but what fun would that have been? And cancer research is just soooooo 1990's, that I'd just as soon give the money to greedy orphans.I do admit that it looks FAHbulous on my wife's wrist, but after wearing it for a few days, she wanted something a bit more high class. I was going to give it to the maid, but when I found out she would sell it to pay for her 5 year old son's operation, I realized she just didn't have the proper upbringing to appreciate such a fine watch. ""Necessary surgery"" indeed. I think it's sitting in a closet somewhere now."
5,Do the math---badly!,"Don't let ANYONE tell you the inability to understand math is a handicap. I bought 20 of these watches, and saved enough to buy a house! Certainly, it's modest house, but it's home.My friends were amazed that I could afford to buy these watches to begin with. Well, I wasn't able to afford them, of course, so after saving $15,000 on each, I returned them, saying they didn't fit.Without my stunning inability to grasp even the most basic math concepts, I would never have been able to imagine this plan, let alone execute it. And let me tell you, failing high school algebra I twice was a small price to pay for my beautiful new home!"
2,Roman Numerals?,This is a nice watch with upside-down Roman numerals. I was just wondering what language the 4 (IIII?) is? Didn't I see this same guy selling Rolex's on the street the other day?
4,"With savings of $54,000, who can resist?","I bought the Cartier Ladies Tank Francaise watch for a girl I met several weeks ago in the Bronx. Her name was Taurus--though I think this was an elaborate sobriquet to throw me off the mark! But I digress. I was searching for the ""Rolex Bling it On!"" watch (also a steal on Amazon.com) when I stumbled upon this incredible timepiece. I took one look at it, and knew my lady Taurus simply had to have it.It was delivered in a small, unassuming box, along with my Arrested Development Season 2 DVD. To be honest, I almost threw it in the trash with the packing material--it was so small! But fortunately, a stray ray of sunlight struck one of the Princess Baguette Cut diamonds, filling the room with glorious white light. After Taurus and I regained our sight, I happily placed this watch on her wrist. It's been a couple of weeks, but hopefully she'll call soon!"
5,Riftwar Legacy - Book 1,"Raymond E. Feist makes a triumphant return to the world of the Riftwar in this book adaptation of the best-selling PC game Betrayal at Krondor. The plot centers around a coming invasion of Moredhel from the north and the quests of James , Locklear , Pug , Owyn , a dropout from Stardock , Gorath , a renegade Moredhel chieftan . and Patrus , the addle brained wizard from Northwarden. It is a classic talke in its own day , and is a satisfying read."
1,WTF is this!!!!!!!!!,"Ok for everyone who wants to buy a cd...dont get this one!!! Nore use to be that dude but this whole album just garbage...two songs thats it..""cocaine cowboys"" but thats been out forever."
1,1 CLASSIC SONG & THE REST CALIENTE BASURA,COCAINE COWBOYS is CLASSIC ... it mighta been slighlty better without the TALKING EXCERPTS but I still like it with it ... but the REST of this ALBUM is HORRIBLE & in RELATION to COCAINE COWBOYS its almost COMICAL how it doesnt FIT .. its like a WHICH ONE DOESNT BELONG TYPE QUESTION ... dont BUY this ALBUM just BUY the COCAINE COWBOYS MP3 or DOWNLOAD FREE on the NET somewhere which will be EASY TO DO
5,Bible of the French language,"This is the end-all and be-all of French grammar. It is expensive, but you will use if for the rest of your life (or as long as you keep up your interest in French). Indispensable for anyone who teaches French - even bizarre grammar questions arise in conversational classes, and this is the one book that will give you the complete answer where other grammars simply leave much to be desired. This reference is not really suitable for beginning students, and might be challenging for intermediate students. But if you are an intermediate student, you owe it to yourself to at least look through it. Even if you can only afford an older edition, I highly recommend it."
4,Highly underrated!!,I don't agree with some of the other reviewers comments about this movie. It moves along at a fast pace with sarcasm and wittydialogue that keeps me entertained and laughing throughout. I say give Dead-Bang a chance. It's one of the best movies Don Johnson ever did.
3,Mistake not to letterbox it.,"This is a good movie, but just what was ""Warner Home Video"" thinking when they released it in full-screen ?. Obviously they weren't thinking at all, since this film is already letterboxed when shown on TV sometimes. So why didn't they bother ?. -Who knows, maybe they hope someone will buy it now and possibly again one day. One thing's for sure, it looks a million times cooler in widescreen so you're a lot better off waiting for that to happen. (-You'll also get to see a tiny bit more of biker extra Ron Jeremy !.) Gary Chang's music is great as always, though."
3,Underrated Frankenheimer Film,"Dead Bang is an exceptional cop film from a great director. John Frankenheimer created a nice, engaging film here. I may be biased because I'm a Don Johnson fan, but I also love cop films so I know what I'm saying. Willim Forsythe and Don Johnson are both good in this, but Penelope Ann Miller is wasted. The plot may be a little cliche , but it gets the job done. If you liked this, I recommend Seven Days In May, The Train and French Connection 2 for other great Frankenheimer films."
2,"Inferior transfer, faulty sound","The movies lacks a wide screen aspect. The transfer is the worst I've seen on a DVD, with scratchy and gritty sound. Not recommended."
3,This format is a waste of time,"This DVD format makes this film a bit of a waste of time for me. In the full-screen this movie loses much of the visual flair and style that director John Frankenhiemer provides for what is nothing more than late 80's action junk. Other than Frankenheimer's in-your-face direction and lensing in some of the action scenes, this film will leave the average viewer very, very flat. If you can sit through the almost unbearable dinner party scenes with Penelope Ann Miller, you at least get the pleasure of witnessing Don Johnson vomit on a suspect! Without the widescreen presentation the only benefits this DVD offers is the ability to jump through some awfully slow and meaningless dialogue(and pause the barf scene if your into such things)."
3,Don In His Prime,"Don Johnson was in his prime when this film was made.The plot is terrible, and the action scenes just okay, and the casting somewhat off, but Johnson gives a good performance.It is worth watching if you are a Don Johnson fan, and I am.Buy used and you won't be too disappointed."
2,Dirty Lethal Don,"I don't know what provoked Don Johnson to use his spare time from ""Miami Vice"" to take part in this fairly repellant film. He should have fired his agent. His Detective Jerry Beck character is one of the more unsavory protagonists to ever grace the silver screen. When Beck vomits on a perp you get the feeling that the only place ""Dead Bang"" has to go is up. The only thing that redeems Beck is that he is allegedly better than the cartoonish white-supremacists that he is tailing. The film also wastes the talents of Tim Reid as a sherriff, William Forsythe as an uptight FBI agent,Michael Jeter as a police psychiatrist who Beck intimidates, and Penelope Ann Miller whose sole purpose in the film is to share a perfunctory bedroom scene with Johnson. About the only thing that redeems this film is that director John Frankenheimer stages a fairly decent showdown scene with the supremacists in the catacombs of an Aryan church."
2,"CAUTION: There are two bands named ""Doubting Thomas""","It is hard to rate this CD since it was not the one that I was looking for. This was not created by the same ""Skinny Puppy"" guys that made ""The Infidel"" and the ""Father Don't Cry"" single. Be sure to find out more information on this CD to see if it is the one that you are looking for."
4,"Good blend of rock, folk and pop. Very good CD!",I had the pleasure of seeing this band live by chance and thoroughly enjoyed them. This is their latest release and is a real gem. If you are looking for a new up and coming band check these guys out!
1,Stolen name,"This is a sub-par band who stole a name from one of the greatest bands known to man. Do not buy this CD if you value your ears, it hurts to listen to. I now use it as a coaster for my drinks, and my drinks deserve better.P.S. There was no zero star rating, so I was forced, painfully at that, to give it one star."
4,The FIRST Band Called Doubting Thomas ... PERIOD.,"Doubting Thomas (this one, the first one, the SUPERIOR one, not involving anyone from the Emaciated Puppy band) formed and first recorded in the late 1980s. The name legally belongs to them. ""Who Died and Made You King"" is their last (and some would argue their best) studio CD. Don't miss it.But please, don't get confused and buy the grotesque racket generated by the impostors. You'll be so disappointed."
1,"Because there's no ""zero stars"" option!","Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows! I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting. NO!! A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best. The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse. Example: ""Hey World"" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance. The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder. ""Louder"" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music. ""Yeah, SUCK louder!"" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five. Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better. ZERO STARS!"
5,THanks for the great service!!!!!,"Could not have had better service, everything was as described and right no time. Thanks for being one of the good ones!"
1,Buffalo farts are probably more musical than this crap!!!,"I can not belive how a band as lame as this can actually get signed to a label. They make Limp Bizkit look like Led Zeppelin and I hate Limp Bizkit! I made the mistake of seeing them on Craig Kilborn the other night and believe it or not, they're even worse live than in the studio. Whne I hear something like this being actually called music, I almost want to ram ice picks into my eardrums so I won't have to hear it. If car company put out cars with the same quality standards as some of today's band's so-called music, we'd all be walking or dead. This sounds like someone yelling and screaming while pushing a lawnmower. As another reviewer said, If I could give this negative stars, I would. Avoid this at all cost!!!"
4,ghetto-tronica,"Absolutely dirty and offensive. Punky electronic music that almost seems like a joke. A.R.E. Weapons are part of the supposed ""electro-clash"" genre and you can hear similarity to artists like chicks on speed or peaches but these are two guys. Dime store casio beats and cheesy toy guitar solos and dirty violent, in your face lyrics. Danceable but more thrashy, imagine if you will some early beastie boys, outkast, and the germs. get this and be instantly hip."
3,Guitar DVD,The teacher starts you off slow and shows you all the basics for playing the guitar.There are gaps in the teachings that leave you asking more questions but for the price its worth the time spent there if coupled with other teachings on the guitar.
4,"Yep, mini-fuses","Well. There's 8 mini-blade fuses. No pulling tool. 2, 5, 7-1/2, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 amperes fuses. I'm not sure I would call the plastic case reusable, there's just some perforations on the back of the cardboard. Keeping it in my truck in case something goes out. Fixed my high beams and my 12v outlet with a fuse, make sure you check yours."
5,Enthusiastically recommended!,"And I mean ""enthusiastically"" very pragmatically. This book is a refreshing addition to my resource collection because it opens up alternative methods to approach programming. I come to this stage of the process with much more confidence and resolve because I have this great book to consult If I should get stuck somewhere.If you are a person that is seeking to become powerfully informed about this stage of designing, or if you are a person seeking to supplement some additional points of view about programming, this book would serve you extremely well."
1,Lois is no longer decieved by Phil and Set Free Orange County,"My title says it all. Lois refuses to have anything more to do with Phil or Set Free because Phil is a deceiver, a user, and a manipulator."
5,Facinating and worth the time to read!,"After reading the fisrt few pages I realized this was no ordinary story. My heart broke with all the terrible things that Lois and her family were put through. Just when you think there is no happy ending in sight, Lois shows you that surviving and continuing in the call God has for your life is truly the VICTORY! I now have at least three hero's in the christian faith thanks to Lois Trader and Phil and Sandra Aguilar.This book is a facinating read page after page.Thank you Lois Trader for the courage to put to paper a story that needs to be told and told often. L.B.M. (Houston)"
1,"Outdated questions, no programming","I am a math finance student who will soon start a summer internship on Wall Street. I want to leave feedback for the best and worst books that I used in my studies so far.These are old questions. I saw early editions, and the questions are almost the same as in the 2001 edition. Very many topics are completely missing or have just a couple questions on them: C++/programming, credit, interest rates, algos are also missing. The only nice things are the stories - but they are also old and will not help you do well on the interview.Not a good expense when Joshi's book and Wilmott's FAQs are much more focused and current."
3,So So questions,"I've gone through the interview book by Xinfeng Zhou and that one was way more organized, explanatory, and quantitative (also cheaper). Heard on the Street seems to be more MBA oriented, no so technical and relatively easy. It's still worth working on since it is easier and takes less time to cover. Besides sometimes (especially when being nervous) we get lost in simple questions and it's a good idea to practice them. The book doesn't seem to cover a lot of quantitative topics such as stochastic calculus, markov chains, dynamic programming, linear algebra, ode-pde, algorithms which i think are much more likely to be asked rather then ""what is Chaos theory?""."
3,A Dying Music,"I must confess that I'm not a fan of Branford Marsalis. His playing seems without any real purpose other than to deliver solid, professional, workman-like jazz. There's very little at risk in any given solo. My big complaint with his work in general is that he never really cuts loose. When he plays fast, loud, or high, he does it all too carefully to accomplish anything dramatic. From a saxophonist's point of view, he doesn't have enough variation of timbre on the soprano to play so much of the music on it. It gets a little tiring. He's got a good tenor sound, but it's pretty conventional. The only strong point on the album for me was ""A Thousand Autumns."" On this track, Marsalis actually comes up with an improvisation containing some substantive melodic ideas and the group has an appealing, though not groundbreaking, sound. Pretty good, but not all he's cracked up to be."
1,APPALLING !,"Sorry I know this is gonna upset a lot of people but this is one of the worst jazz cd's I have heard todate. Anybody wanna buy my copy?Yes, I confess I like smooth jazz but before you jazz traditionalists pass judgement down from the olypian heights from whence you have placed yourselves I must say that I like to pride myself on my jazz collection which includes some of the all time greats like Phil Woods, Joshua Redman, Lee Konitz, Georgie Fame, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker ..... in fact I could go on all day.This cd I feel is a little too ""off the wall"" and diverse for my liking and I rather suspect dear old Branford tried a little too hard. In his quest for the extreme I think he lost plot. Not, in my opinion, a fitting finale for the excellent and much missed pianist Kenny Kirkland.I give it one star for effort."
1,reactionary jazz,"Here is another set of straight-ahead jazz, just like they played it 40 years ago, from reactionary saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Yes, it's more challenging than Kenny G... but for anyone interested in truly innovative and ORIGINAL music, I would recommend checking out Dave Douglas, William Parker, Ken Vandermark, Steve Lacy or possibly even the ""self-indulgent bull****"" of Cecil Taylor."
5,The Kodaly go out with a bang,"Well, this is the easiest review to write in the world. The Kodaly topped off their cycle with incandescent performances of Opus 17. Ignore that old grump Hans Keller: there's some fine music here, not least Number 4 which is the only quartet that Haydn ever wrote in C Minor. By any standard, even late Haydn, it is a masterpiece. What longing fills its slow movement - if you had told me that it had been written decades later in 1790 when Haydn was so desperate to leave the Esterhazy birdcage, I would have believed you. Beautifully terraced, the last movement is energy itself. Elsewhere, it is always interesting to hear Haydn in E Major (to wit Symphony No 29) - so it proves to be with the first quartet of this set.The Kodaly are well recorded. If you are in the hunt for Opus 17 then your quarry is here."
3,Careful with the error accusations,"For ""naiche"" from Brooklyn who wants to edit this book, you are incorrect regarding at least one of your alleged error finds in this book. Washakie most certainly did fight at the Battle of the Rosebud, as reported by no less an authority than J.W. Vaughn in With Crook At The Rosebud (see page 62 of the hardcover edition by Stackpole Books copyright 1994)."
1,Do some research before you write a book,Books like this one really pisses me off. There are so many mistakes that stick out you dont even have to be a student of the battle to spot them. There are so many it makes you wonder if the author did any research at all or even if these mistakes are made on purpose to mislead the readers to full fill the authors agenda.If you want to read about the battle by an author that just reports the facts and doesnt take sides there are a few great books out there to read.Cavalier in Buckskin by Robert Utley (the 2nd printing the updated version) Little Bighorn by Robert Nightengale for the Indian story Lakota Noon is very well done but the best books out there is To Hell with Honor by Larry Skelnar and A Terrible Glory by James Donovan.Custer Vindicated is also good as well is Custer by Robert MonoghanDont waste your time with this one because how can you beleive anything in here with so many mistakes that just jump out at you.
2,Old fashioned translation washes the play out,"While ""The Frogs"" is full of satire, self-mockery, and lots of Greek humor, you wouldn't know it from this translation. I honestly think it's worth the $2-3 to purchase a modern translation (either online or check your local used bookstore), so that you can enjoy the play rather than wading through syrupy, old-fashioned language that saps the life out of the play."
2,Aristophane's The Frogs,"Did anyone edit this translation? It's pretty bad, which is a shame for a good play. Fortunately, it was free, but it was not as pleasant a read as it should have been."
4,Industrial and Large,"I ended up returning this item because it was a lot beefier than I anticipated (the extruding poles are at least 1"" diameter). I planned to put my cable box on it, but the shelf would have dwarfed the box. I would imagine this shelf would be perfect for larger, heavier items like a large speaker. It seemed very well made."
3,Beware!,"Beware of this album. The entry above seems to imply that this album isby the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In fact, only one of the eleven selections is by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The other selections include a variety of artists including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Boys' Choir, Virgil Fox, Andy Williams, Floyd Cramer, Glen Campbell, and others."
2,Needs a Divorce,"Sherman Jamison is rich, and I mean stinkingly very rich. No one will inherit his wealth aside his wife who refused him a divorce and he wants someone else to inherit his cash other than the wife. He has amassed millions and now wants someone to pass them on to, the next in the family line. But he has no heir as his wife has been unable to have children. Refusing to let this stand in his way, Sherman pleads for a divorce but his wife, a devout Catholic, refuses to give into his demands. If she will not agree, she will have to be removed. Sherman hires a professional killer to do the deed but this is only the beginning of a thrilling and electrifying story of revenge, betrayal and murder. Again suspense become the theme of a drama scene"
1,Que Decepcion,"Escuche pedazos de las canciones que ofrece Amazon.com. Lamentablemente esperaba mas de sus canciones de amor, de la vida cotidiana y de esos temas que lo hicieron famoso. Pero lo que escuche son canciones acerca de religion y de Dios. Si yo quiero oir de Dios la mejor manera es ir a la Iglesia. Este disco no se acerca a nada a sus otros trabajos anteriores."
2,Worst CD by far to date - the man lost his way,"How said that this the great Juan Luis Guerra has lost his way to become an unfortunate souless born again ""Christian"".His music opened up hope and God with examining the beauty of the world and an appreciation of the love of the world and true spirituality.No he has lost his vision in this self-centered CD that has lost all of the inspiring spirituality of his incredible work.The arrangements are their, but the music is hollow and I wonder why he chose to go this way. For exceptance in this world of faith over actions and behaviors.So sad ...."
1,stick with the salsa and not the gospel,what was i thinking?!?!? there goes 8 dollars down the drain... a waste if money dont bother buying it.
1,Arrived Broken,We received it broken and contacted them numerous times for a replacement but they keep ignoring us. Don't buy here!
5,Bravo!,"No JLG collection can be complete without this deeply sincere spiritual chronicle. His heart is really on his sleeve in this CD and it's an amazing musical experience. And yes, the merengues here are as complex and powerful as ever!"
2,"no es lo mismo, ni es igual.","talves igual habria sido mejorno es nada malo alabar a dios, pero la verdad cuando es en un producto musical es bueno tener un cierto balance. todas las canciones directa o indirectamente son de alabanza a dios. y solo una de las canciones se parece a lo que era bueno en juan luiz guerra (bachata, ritmo, temas mundanos....)si estan buscando algo de el estilo de, no es lo mismo ni es igual, es mejor buscar en otra parte. lastima porque solia ser uno de esos artistas a los cuales esperaba uno ancioso por años. desastroso."
4,Good CD,"This is only the second or third Spanish music CD that I've purchased. However, I do like it."
5,Excellent!,"Honestamente eso esta Chevere! El habla enor de Senores Y Rey de Reyes! Yo creo que debe de aver mas cantantes que hablen de Dios porque eso habla Verdad! La musica no solamente es de hablar de el Amor entre hombre y mujer... Pero de Amor entre Hijo y Padre,, y el padre es Dios! Que Siga Pa'lante con el Senor!Honestly this Cd is Awesome! He talks about The Lord, I think that there should be more singers that talk about the Lord instead of Sex Money and Drugs. Because talking about the Lord is TRUTH... Music isnt only made to talk about a Love between man and woman.. but about son and Father.. and the father is God!Keep Going In the Right Direction... Jesus Loves You! Take Care and God Bless!"
2,Bottom line - do you like Christian music?,"Do you like Christian Rock? What if one of your favorite groups came out with a Christian album, would you buy it?If yes, and you have any interest in merengue, you'll like this CD. If no, the lyrics just don't interest you for whatever reason, then avoid this album.I ordered this CD ""blindly"" thinking ""all-right, Juan Luis Guerra has come out with a new album!"", listened to it once thinking ""what the heck?"", and promptly gave it to my brother-in-law who happens to like Christian music. If he were giving this review, I'm sure he'll give it a 5. I'm giving it a 2 because, while the music is good, I just didn't care for the lyrics.If you are at all interested in Juan Luis Guerra, and he does have some great albums out there, I recommend listening to ""Ni es lo mismo, Ni es iqual"" or ""Arieto"". If you are at all interested in Christian music, then by all means buy ""Para Ti"". It's just not my cup of tea."
4,Not a Big Fan,"I'm not a fan of Spanish language music, and I'm not a fan of contemporary Christian family friendly music, but I happen to like this CD.The first time I heard ""Soldado"", I was riding in a car with a bunch of people, and everybody from seven year old Jennifer to her grandmother sang along and enjoyed the music. The music has a solid beat and the lyrics definitely express the joy of someone who recently gave his heart to the Lord.I'm not surprised that it won at the Grammies."
3,"Good idea, in theory...","I applied this to my iPod, and the only part that stayed was the larger, main screen guard. The smaller covers for the spinner fell off within the day.I'd go for a different product if you want complete coverage, but if all you're looking to cover and protect everything except the spinner, then this product is a good pick."
3,I'd already been thinking about giving this kit ...,"I'd already been thinking about giving this kit a try, and was glad to be able to Test Drive it. It had pretty simple instructions and was easy to use. However, if it doesn't turn positive after the first five test sticks, the test instructions say to keep testing with another kit, which could get expensive. I think there should be more test sticks."
4,I found this product to be very easy ...,I found this product to be very easy to use and very informative. I'd definitely recommend this product to all my friends who are trying to have a baby. It's easy and the price is right!!
3,"The test was easy enough to use. However, ...","The test was easy enough to use. However, it was messy, as the urine collection pad didn't have a cover on it. You have to place it on the table with the collection pad facing downwards (since the result window is on the other side) and that resulted in a most unhygienic and messy situation with urine on the table. I found that to be the biggest drawback. Also, reading the results wasn't easy; there's a difference between the darkness of the lines, even if you have two lines that would indicate a positive result. I think it's an average product."
2,The Answer One Step Ovulation Test has some ...,"The Answer One Step Ovulation Test has some drawbacks. First of all, if you don't have a fairly regular cycle the five tests won't be enough to determine when you'll ovulate. Also, the test itself should be marked at the window indicating the test line. This would avoid confusion about which line you're actually reading, without having to refer to the picture to make sure that you're holding it correctly for an accurate reading."
5,"The kit was easy to use, and even ...","The kit was easy to use, and even easier to read. I had no problem telling what the lines meant. I highly recommend this product if you're trying to have a baby."
3,"Not too bad, but could be better","This is the first of the Buffy books I read, and I was dissapointed. In my opinion, the series is awesome, but this book was no better than an R.L. Stine novel or another ""teen"" horror. The plot was predictable and the climax was anticlimactic. I feel that anyone could have written this book- it had no surprises or interesting plots, just cliches.But I don't want to be too hard on it, it was Buffy, so it's hard to hate it. If you're a devout Buffy fan, or looking for a no-brainer plot to read in your spare time, this could be the book for you."
5,THE BEST BUFFY BOOK YET!!,"I have loved all of the Buffy books, but this was my favourite. If you sit there & read the book, you can just picture her doing all the kicks & jumps, etc. Great book, I loved the whole scarecrow idea."
3,Could have been better.,"Pathetic, is all I can say. The author got all the characters totally wrong, they don't sound like anything Buffy, Willow or Xander would say. It lacks of the Buffy's witty lines we all love. And Xander's jokes are even lamer than they usually are. But what disappoints me the most is Willow, she is NOT the Willow we know at all. The Scooby Gang will never leave Buffy out and go make out with some carneys, in Xander case, I can understand but Willow? She'll never do that. If you're a fan of big fan of Buffy and own all other Buffy books, then this one will just complete your list, if you aren't, avoid this book."
3,"Explores new possibilities, but not too interesting.","Poor, poor, pathetic Willow. The girl is so consumed with thinking she's not worthy of a guy's attention, that she is so easy to fall into the attention of a guy she meets. After all the demons they have seen and slayed, has she learned nothing?? See""The Harvest"" when a still in-the-dark-about-Buffy's-secret Willow is seen led off by a vampire. Is she that hard to teach?"
3,This story is great,"This story sended tremors and fears about going to the carnival. I suggest reading it, but I also state that children wouldn't want to read it because of the sexual material occurs. I rated this 3 stars because Coyote Moon could of been better to be sold. The descriptive words are dim, Even I can create a better book."
5,Excellent reading for the fans of Buffy,"This was one of the more spooky Buffy books that I have had the chance to read as it brings you into the world of the carnival people and tells about how they become a pack of coyotes when the moon is full.. Most of us have been to a carnival at least once in our lives and have imagined what it is really like once all the people are gone and the lights go out. This book tells us the behind the scenes scoop of this particular carnival and the sudden appearance of a pack of coyotes that end up terrorizing Sunnydale. As always in all the Buffy books, Buffy and her friends come out on top but not before tangling one on one with a new breed of monster. Even though I am older than the expected audience for this book, I am a fan of the show and really enjoyed the book."
5,"Very entertaining, very similar to the show's great episodes","The book is wonderful. The dialogue is exactly like the show's funny lines, and the author portrays the characters the way they should be. The book gives you laughs and slight chills. If you love Buffy, this is the best in the series so far."
4,Great read......,"I really liked this book. I read them in order, so this was number 3 for me. I love the show and this, to me, would have made for great episode material. It really explored the characters thoughts and the plot was fairly stable. Xander had more time to shine in here, than he normally does in the tv show. I liked his role in here. It's about time they give him some credit. And yes, he is my favorite, because of the sarcastic remarks. :0)"
5,Coyote Moon,This book is probably one of the best book I've read of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Series. It's filled with suspense and keeps you reading til the end. It is a very good book for Buffy fans. So read it!
4,Pretty Good,"I read this book a long time ago, and I can still remember it. For both good and bad reasons. I liked it because it was-it was-it was- well, I guess I liked it because it had to do with Buffy. I didn't like it because the humor wasn't as it is in the show, and the authors didn't catch the relationships between the characters. I didn't really like the story line that much, and it was kind of well, boring at times. I would still recommend that you read it however."
1,Could have been so much more...,"Pity pity, that's what I've to say about this one. It could have been so good with a subject about werecoyotes ans shapeshifters. Instead it falls to average. The author got the characters totally wrong, especially Willow. It's also full of contradictions and stupid mistakes and there's total lack of suspense. If you're a Buffy fan, like me, you can still enjoy it. But for all others, pass on this one. I really expected more from a guy who has written over a dozen of Star Trek books."
2,Weezer Tribute Review,"One of the better qualities of this tribute is that most of the artists try to make the songs their own. However, this is detrimental to the overall sound because it is not very cohesive at all and most of the covers are pretty horrible. One of the better covers is The Dashboard Confessionals, ""Jamie,"" which is actually pretty suited to the lead singer's voice. ""Surf Wax America"" is pretty horribly covered, just a bunch of screaming, which is disappointing since the original Weezer song is so exciting and fun to listen to. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing record because the reason most of these covers are passable is because they try so hard to sound like Rivers Cuomo and the rest of the band. Covers are supposed to be distincitive of the artists trying to recreate the songs. I would recommend you to not buy this CD, but download these songs from iTunes or something if you want the cover version:- The Good Life- El Scorcho- Jamie- Only in Dreams"
2,I've had better....,"I was horribly disappointed at this weezer tribute album. I was expecting it to be so much better. Weezer is an awesome band, and the bands who play on this cd are pretty good themselves. The only songs that I could bare to listen to were the ones redone by midtown, the ataris, dashboard, and the stereo. The other's were hard to listen to- they so severely butchered weezer's songs. The other reviews led me to think that this could be a cd I actually wanted to purchase. hmmmm... guess I was wrong."
5,awesome,Hadn't listened to this for a few years. Happy to have it. Product was brand new and arrived on the shirt end of the time frame that they said it would. Very pleased.
4,some gems,"there are some amazing versions of some great weezer songs on this cd. I was most impressed with mycomplex's version of tired of sex. They do some crazy stuff on that track and it makes the whole album worth while. Although many of the artists renditions are WAY too similar to the originals, there are some brilliant renditions also.recommended tracks: Grade ""Surfwax America"", Mycomplex ""Tired Of Sex"", The Stereo ""El Scocho"", and Affinity ""My Name Is Jonas"""
1,I thought tribute meant honor?,I guess it now means wholesale slaughter. The only reason I gave this compliation one star was for Midtown's rendition of Susanne. The rest of the album was akin to an Open Mike Night with a bunch of drunken Shriners. Stick with the original.
1,It only lasts 24 hours,"Be advised if you buy this product it only works ""up to 24 hours"" I never would have brought this product had I known this It should be stated in product description on amazon,maybe I missed it."
4,That 50's Sound,That great 50's sound with the clean quality afforded by digital recording.Jack and the band does an awesome job. I recommend this music.
4,"The first ""real book"" I had ever read, a great story!","Like many ""first's"" in life, I can recall the first time I read Ash Road. It depicted a time, and place, and culture, that was completely different to my own. As a young person, the book moved me to interpret life, and indeed the world, in a new light. From that point on in my educational career, I embraced the idea of reading for ""pleasure"", an undertaking that has literally changed my life. Thank you Mr. Southall. Now I plan on giving Ash Road as a birthday gift to my sixth grade daughter, who is constantly bothering me to stay up ""just a little longer"", .......to read."
5,Winston has renewed my love for art!!,"Turning the pages of this book I can't help but create my own ideas on how this government of ours really works. Winston hits on so many issues prevalent in today's society, with work he has been doing for years. I am so glad I picked up this book after reading his name in the credit part of all my Dead Kennedys albums. Winston's book is absolutely brilliant. And the new one will be well appreciated."
5,"cool book,good seller",thank you for the fast shipping and great price - book condition was as described
3,Just so.,The stories were beautifully written. However they should have been much longer. It seems to me that all stories started out nicely but ended in a hurry.
3,Could Have Been Better,"I really enjoyed this CD. All of the song's were pretty good. The only problem I had with this album was the way it was recorded. It seem's while recording this CD they forgot to turn up the volume. The cassette tape was just fine, but they did something wrong while recording the CD. Anyhow, you can still enjoy this album, you'll just need to really crank up the volume!"
5,The Perfect Gift,Bought this cd for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.A must have for PVD fans.
4,A stellar collection from one of trance's prolific DJ's,"The three disc set of Van Dyk's best mixes prove to be a must have for all trance lover's. Each disc is a journey crafted by one of the best trance DJ's in the business. Global Underground lover's can't live without this one. Personally, Van Dyk should have a global underground too, but hey, that's just an opinion. Forget the price tag, you get what you pay for and this collection is certainly worth any price. GET IT!"
5,The Best Progressive Trance DJ Mix EVER,A DJ mix from Paul van Dyk is a big deal. But when I heard Vorsprung I was taken away. This is honestly the best electronix CD one could ever purchase. The only thing that can top this is going to hear him live in person.
5,mind blowing techno trance at its best,When i first heard this i was a little aprehensive because i already have all of Paul Van Dyks albums.The first cd really makes a statment.BTs blue skies is by far the best tune on the album.Cd 2 picks up right where the first left with hard banging trance.Cd 3 slows down to a more deeper melodic trance which really puts the icing on the cake.All in all this has to be the best thing Paul has ever produced.To describe it in one word would be AMAZING!
2,This book is ok.,"I would not advise buying this book.Most students buy this book only because their lecturers say it's a good book; afterwards they discover that the book isn't as good as was first claimed to be.The first ten chapters are well-written, but the following chapters are difficult to understand. All the students studying Abstract Algebra have admitted that they had difficulties with this book. Get a copy from the library and see what you think."
4,Dean Friedman' first two albums,"As a songwriter in the 70's Dean Friedman wrote clever, sentimental, philosopical and quirky lyrics to singable melodies and memborable hooks. He wrote about characters from, ""Shopping Bag Ladies"" to people meeting for the first time, ""The Deli Song."" He also had one hit, ""Ariel."" He textured his songs with strings, jazzy arrangements, piano, guitars and layered vocals. His songs ranged from jazz influence to folk and pop. Even though he did not reach critical and popular acclaim his songs would make you laugh, think and cry. His songs could be listened to multiple times without boring you."
4,Cat Fancy,"I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat."
2,"Too many ads, not enough articles",The articles that are in Cat Fancy are well written and informative. Unfortunately there are more ads than articles.Not worth the price. Better off getting cat information online for free.
2,Too many ads,"Very disappointing how this magazine has changed. Many years ago, I used to recommend this periodical for cat owners. It USED to be FULL of useful information for cat owners. Now it has one or two good articles and the rest seems geared toward the money making cat industry. For me, too much information about expensive breeds and a TON of ads. I ADOPT all my cats. Wish I would have purchased one off the stands before I gave this magazine another try - worse, I ordered the Dog fancy too :("
2,Very basic newbee articles,"Being a cat owner for over 20 years I find this magazine too basic of cat care to be usefull. Almost everything I read in this magazine are things I already know. It seems like each issue will cover a lot about one subject and not much else. For example, one issue will be full of almost all grooming articles, another issue will be almost all about senior cats, there is the kitten issue that comes out every year ect ect. Now if your a new cat owner this magazine would be nice way to get basic knowledge about caring for cats. But for long time cat owners I am sure everything you read in here will be something you have heard before. It is fun seeing the cat breed articles but for that you cat just pick up a copy of Cats USA. So I will not be re-subscribing to this and will be looking for a new cat magazine that features more advanced articles."
5,Great Magazine,This is a pretty informative magazine. It also arrived very quickly after I ordered it. I would recommend it to any cat lover.
4,cats,"I think it's silly to ask a cat lover if they like a magazine about cats. The magazine is full of wonderful pictures of cats, with even a sexy centerfold suitable for framing.The articles are of current interest, to the point, and brief enough to hold the reader.The advertizements are useful and I study every one.If you love cats you need this magazine."
5,Cat Fancy Magazine,"As a proud owner of several cats, I highly recommend this magazine. I really enjoy the different articles about cats and their humans!"
3,Cat Fancy is...Good But Could Be Better,"I really love Cat Fancy. I have been getting it for two years now, and I read all of the articles. Even though some of them don't apply to me/my cats now, they have good signs to watch out for. I really like the poster in the center. I am disappointed, however, with the breeder directory section. I don't believe in breeding cats when there are already many loving and friendly cats needing homes. I adopted my two cats after they were found in a dumpster at six weeks old. I also don't like how the magazine treats 'purebreds' better than 'mixed breeds'. If the last half of the magazine weren't included, this magazine would easily get my five stars."
3,It's ok....,"The articles in the magazine are great. However, half of the magazine is an advertisement for pure bred cats. I personally promote adopting cats from shelters, so I don't have any interest in the ads. If you have pure bred cats, you will probably enjoy this magazine more than I have."
2,Delivery Delay - Gift Notification,"Ordered gift subscription for a friend on Dec 20. Now Jan 21 and friend has yet to receive a gift notice from either Amazon or Cat Fancy. Also in this computer age, why should Cat Fancy take 2-3 months for first issue? It's absurd!"
1,Cat Fancy,For some reason this was put in an order by mistake that I was making for shoe inserts. I do not want this magazine. Carol Williams
2,Not a lot of substance...,"I really love cats, but this mag is pretty boring. There isn't any info in it you can't find on the Web."
4,"The ""Cat Fancy"" magazine has some great mews... I mean news.","""Cat Fancy"" is an excellent source of information for people owned by their cat.Unfortunately, I'm always wanting more when I'm done reading the magazine. I wish the magazine would be bigger with more medical articles."
3,Good value -- design flawed a bit,"I think this pre-shave product is good in general. Once on, the razor glides quite nicely. Not too greasy (though greasy can be good sometime, eg. 'Williams 'lectric shave'). But the application of it is poor ... the hole in the bottle is too big! The product spills out more (on purpose? for profit?) when you shake-squirt it on your hand/s. On other brands, like Williams, the hole is much smaller, and easier to apply; hence less messy.That flaw aside, I think this is a good value overall. I may write the manufacturer about this! The poor application design."
4,Interesting Book,"I have bought this book. It looks pretty interesting. I can't give it five stars. I looked up on 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.b4?!?, and I found NOTHING!."
2,Late-period Lightnin',"Not your first Lightnin' Hopkins purchase by a long shot, but this works OK as one of his final statements. Less immediately likeable than consistent, this release finds Lightnin' playing less and letting the rhythm section do much of the work. This is for people who have a lot of Lightnin' Hopkins music and want to hear a slice of him at the end of his career on an occasion when he was still giving it a reasonable effort. No tracks stand out, but almost any Lightnin' is good Lightnin.'"
5,Excellent perfume,"I had used this perfume before and was completely satisfied with the fragrance. i would recommend it to anyone looking for a long last fragrance. I tried to find it in the UK, but ended up buying it from the US as i could not find it here. Was a bit disappointed with the seller would communicate but it has nothing to do with the quality of the product."
2,"High Sodium, Rock Hard","I was looking for a chip that was low sodium and tasted decent. I thought these simply naked pita chips would be good, but they are not. I read the nutrition facts. 270mg for 1 oz./serving size! That's 1620mg for the bag!!!!! These 6oz. bags are not very big either! You can finish them pretty quick, like some people have said here.I really wouldn't say these chips are healthy, there is fat and saturated fat.However, these chips are healthier than cheetos, and doritos, but they don't taste as good. They are also rock hard."
4,Simple and good!,These chips are made of pita and salt. They are simple and tasty- work great with hummus. My whole family loves them.
5,Excellent buy,These are really a great buy. They were packaged well and arrived on time. They are delicious and natural. It is very hard not to eat the entire bag. They are much more expensive in the stores.
1,"Great chips, if any weren't broken","The pita chips were very tasty and addictive. But, I've gone through 3 bags out of 6 and so far, I think I've found a total of 15 chips that were larger than one square inch. Obviously, it is likely a shipping issue that broke most of the chips, but the impact to me is still the same: a bag of chips that are very difficult to eat.I think my local Sam's Club has these more reasonably priced, in larger bags, and I'm more likely to get unbroken chips."
2,Dry Erase Music Staff Easel,"It was unwieldy. Every time I tried to write on it, it toppled over. Also, I was given GREEN dry-erase pens. Black would have been more visible to my students. Sorry. I didn't like it much."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this video in Feb 2007 with the intention of using it to help plan my trip to PEI in 2008. While the DVD case and the DVD both clearly say ""Running time: 1hr, 30min"", the video is actually only about 23 minutes long. The info is good, but not very detailed at all! I was very disappointed. I paid $12.99 for the DVD, but I think that's way too high for only 23 minutes of information. In my opinion, anyone would be better off spending their time looking up information on the internet or investing in a good book on PEI."
3,I'm also disappointed...,I'm also disappointed a little. It's just a 23 minute long video... It's too short. And why it states on the disc and on the case it's 1h 30 min. long? :(
3,Lapse of Growls,"I was rather disappointed with this album compared with the previous Amorphis albums. The growled lyrics have all but been phased out. In a time when any other death metal band was playing adrenaline pumped speed riffs, it was nice how Amorphis showed that this genre didn't need to be constant pounding. This is by far their richest album, but I think it's gone from ""progressive death"" to mere ""progressive rock"". Fans may enjoy this if they liked where the previous albums were heading (specifically Elegy), but death fans will be embarassed to play this for their friends."
2,What happened to the death vocals?,"After hearing Tuonela and seeing Amorphis live at the NJ Metalfest, my opinion of them has dropped drastically. Tomi Koivusaari should have continued to do the vocals for Amorphis. Tales from the Thousand Lakes is one of the greatest albums of all time. To see them totally remove (except for track 5) the death metal vocals from their latest release is very disappointing. I liked Elegy a lot but they've gone too far with this one..."
3,Overrated but .......,"To those of you who read this review I shud like to say, that i have never listened to any of tuonela's other albums and therefore I have no idea of what their previous albums sound like. Having said that, my verdict: the album fell short of expectations given the ratings that it got on this fourm. There is nothing fantastically technical about the music. To draw some comaprisons, the music is a bit like Dream Theatre, but lacks the subtle time changes that you find in DT albums. All in all i wouldnt write it off as a bad buy, but if you are the type of listener who is generally looking for variety in metal(melodic), then the album is definitely worthwhile."
4,A big fan but a bit upset,"I have been an avid fan since Tales... Elegy is the best amorphis album ever. Had I never heard Elegy, I would give this 5 stars but while the album is great I miss the death vocals. Only greed had them. They could have satisfied me just by doing a a little death each song, or a couple older fasioned songs. I still love Amorphis and recomend the album to those who haven't heard them, but I would choose Elegy over Tounela."
4,"Great, but still not as good as ELEGY!!","This release is very good! In fact, so far in '99, the only better release has been EMPEROR's IX Equilibrium. However, Tuonela is simply not as good as their last, Elegy. The songs are ""simpler"" in composition. There is really little or no of the ""progressive experimentation"" that Amorphis is known for. I will say, though, that ""Divinity"" is their BEST song! One aspect of this album that does SURPASS their back catalog, is the abandonment of the ""death vocals"" (with the lone exception of 'Greed')."
2,I hated it,"Am I just not hearing this right? This was my first Amorphis cd. I got it because I enjoy Opeth and Lacuna Coil and I thought that maybe this band would be along those lines. Well, I was disappointed. Even though they have a Theatre of Tragedy ring to them I found that they have too much of an 80's long-haired rock band metal kind of sound. I didn't find them amusing at all. Maybe I would have to listen to this cd about 10 times before it would grow on me, but I'm not about to find out. I have other more important cd's to listen to."
2,Have you guys ever listened to Amorphis before?!?,"I can't believe some of the rave reviews I'm reading about this album. Amorphis has now done what seemingly most other bands do when they finally make it big: they mellow out way too friggin' much. I can't believe there are hardly ANY death vocals on this album!! They just aren't the band I used to know back in the days of ""Tales..."". I love Amorphis, but this was a HUGE disappointment. Like I said before, I don't know what you other guys are smoking, but this album is horribly boring, much less ""a masterpiece"" (geez, not even). If they continue in this direction, their next release should be a fuzzy stoner rock album. But I won't know, cause I'm adding Amorphis to my collection of sold out bands who turned into pussies. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because ""Tales..."" and ""Elegy"" were so damn good that they deserve something at least."
1,Terrible album from an excellent band,"How disappointing is this? Amorphis seem to have put experimentation and production before songwriting. This is a band that made its name with dynamic, original riffing and there isn't one to be seen on the whole album. Now we have banjos and flutes. Although these instruments add something to the music, Amorphis forgot to write decent songs in the first place. I have no problem with Amorphis abandoning their death metal roots for a more melodic sound, but there aren't any memorable melodies. Pasi Koskinen is a woeful vocalist and and even worse lyricist - some of the stuff here will make you laugh. In a word: bland. There is a myriad of bands that do the same thing far better...try Katatonia, Anathema or Green Carnation for melodic, progressive metal that leaves Tuonela for dead."
4,It grows on you,"You can see the theme of Tuonela on the cover of the album, which shows a withering leaf. Most of the songs are about the decline of things, with a lot of autumn and winter imagery. So it's a little mournful, but with spirit rather than weepiness. Musically it reminded me a little of Metallica; reasonably heavy and not too complex, but it doesn't get very repetitive and the riffs are to support the lyrics rather than being the only attractive part of the music. The lyrics are very intelligent and imaginative, and with a little rewriting by a native English speaker they could have been truly poetic. This is one of the few metal albums I wouldn't be embarrassed to be caught singing along to."
3,"well, it's different","I still have mixed opinions about this cd. Certain songs are really good, and certain songs are really dull and boring. They no longer use death metal style vocals, except for the song ""Greed"". That happens to be one of the better songs. The first song, ""The Way"", is probably my favorite song on the cd. Very melodic, very heavy, and very memorable. Most of the other songs sound like they're trying to fit in with alternative fans or something. This is one of those cds that I can't say whether to buy it or skip it. It just depends on the fan. If you're expecting this to be a death metal cd, then you probably want to skip it. If you're interested in the new direction they're going, give this cd a try."
2,A Change for the worse....,"In word word, this is a very disappointing album. It seems the band have found a new direction with Pasi in vocals, and have discarded their death metal roots in order to play more prog rock. This is not always a bad thing, but Pasi's voice, while unique, is dull. Gone also are the great musical sequences and ripping guitar riffs which made this band great.If you were a fan of their earlier music (Elegy, Tales from a 1000 Lakes), then don't get this."
4,One of their weakest..but still great,"If you listened to Elegy before Amorphis' newer albums Tuonela and Am Universum you knew they were going in this direction. Though I like to think of Tuonela as Amorphis' warm up for the classic that would come Am Universum.This is the album that pretty much abandones all their death metal roots. Besides the song Greed, which gets pretty intresting with the sitar added to it though. Some songs can get fairly repetive but when Tuonela hits the mark, it HITS the mark. The Way, Divinity, Tuonela, Greed, and Morningstar are classics. The rest of the albums...well it's nowhere as good. Overall Tuonela meerly acts as a bridge between Elegy and Am Universum."
4,was incredible the first week,"My 6 year old son has adhd. I refuse to put him on prescription meds. I tried mindcare jr and WOW. The change in him was immediate. I saw a side to my child I didn't no existed. He went from from getting reds in class to greens for an entire week. He was sweet, agreeable, told me loved me, was always in a great mood. What a true pleasure he was. Then he slowly started dropping back to yellows in class to reds again. He started getting frustrated easily and moody again. What happened??? Every child is different perhaps with other children the affects will last longer. I'm going to try and find more products that work for him and try alternating them. The only thing I can figure is his body built up a tolerance to it. I hope this helps."
3,Musicality of Lerner and Loewe,"The singing on the selections were a little too operatic.I know Broadway performances are more boisterious and dramatic but the vocals were too ""heavy"" for me personally."
2,Not quite what it seems,"The cover photo and written description of this book are great, but buyers should realize there's no ""Look Inside!"" feature, and the description correctly doesn't say anything about music. The book contains written descriptions of numerous songs, plus lyrics, but no music (notes, chords, etc.) to go by, except for ABBACCA-type verse descriptions, or references to tunes common to 1923 but now long forgotten. This book's a great historical archive if the reader's already an accomplished folk musician who knows century-old tunes from memory, but difficult to appreciate for the rest of us."
3,Definitely not DeNiro's best,"I was really hoping this would be a great movie since Robert DeNiro is such a great actor. It turned out I was wrong. I would call ""City by the Sea"" a so-so movie. The concept was (I guess) ok and the ending was far FAR from spectacular. All-in-all I probably won't see it again. I don't know, maybe 3 out of 5 is being too kind.Other than ""City by the Sea"" I recommend ""The Score"", a great DeNiro movie."
3,A cursed family with kidnapping and drug addiction,"The acting in movie is pretty good but the script is kind of a predictable clunker about doom and gloom in drug addict city.The grandfather was executed, the father had a failed marriagethat left a fatherless undirected son.A fourth generation complicates the plot, but adds a mellow ending aftershooting and waste set in?If you are going to produce a film with Robert de Niro and FrancisMcDormand, you should have plot and dialog up to it?"
3,Not among DeNiro's best,"Very average cop drama with DeNiro playing a variation on a theme he's done a million times before. Based on a true story, evidently, but the character actors here make it seem very rote Hollywood. Frances McDormand is decent, as usual, as the older girlfriend. This could have been a plot from NYPD Blue. Watch it, but don't expect to be wowed."
3,A Yawner At Best,"This movie never really gets off the ground. In its effort to develop the characters, it moves at a snail's pace with no significant action. The whole mood of the movie is utterly depressive and the dialogue is monotone.The plot involves Robert DeNiro playing a seasoned cop who starts investigating the homicide of a drug pusher. He soon finds that his estranged son in the prime suspect in the homicide and is brought back into the torments of his failed family life.Yes, the movie does touch upon a failed father's attempt to show his son that he's looking out for him but, with that low-life heroin fiend son of his, you wonder: why? The son is portrayed as such a pathetic loser that the film simply evokes no sympathy for him. I came out feeling more for Robert DeNiro's character in having to accept his conception of such a pathetic wretch for a son.Altogether a very forgettable film that perhaps would have been better as a book or one of those cheesy made-for-tv ""Lifetime"" films."
3,A PROBLEM SHARED...,"Vincent LaMarca (Robert De Niro) is a police officer who has problems with intimacy, sharing, and commitment. These issues are reflected in his estranged son Joey (James Franco) who is a drug user and is wanted for murder of a drug dealer named Picasso (Jay Boryea), a murder he did commit. Frances McDormand plays Michelle, the girlfriend of LaMarca, someone who Di Niro has a hard time confiding in. Eliza Dushku is Joey's drug using girlfriend.As De Niro and the cops are looking for Joey, so is Spyder (William Forsythe) the drug partner of dead Picasso. This is low action cop drama, which delves into the character of LaMarca, and is perhaps a study in psychology on how we are affected by our relationships with our father. The drama overshadows the crime aspect of the story. Well acted, directed etc. I just wasn't overly entertained by the film...and I blame my father for that.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
4,Your editorial review has the wrong facts about location!,"I saw City by the Sea, and in general it was very well-acted. It was a good story. At times it was a little slow. But unlike what your editorial review says, it was set in Long Beach, NY, on Long Island, but filmed in Asbury Park, NJ. Vincent Lamarca was a cop in New YOrk city in the movie, and in real life he was a cop in Long Beach. I live in the town over from Asbury, Ocean Grove, and it was cool to see both in the film.-Heather Ronovech, Ocean Grove, NJ"
1,A Movie Without and Ending,I was really looking forward to this. De Niro usually does good pictures and refuses the stinkers. But I was really let down by film's ending. It needed to wrap up 4-5 of the storylines that it started. The viewer is left to make up his/her own ending and guess what happened to all of the rest of the characters. An episode of Law and Order tells as good of a story and does a better job of dealing with the details.
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I struggled to watch this film because it had pretty good actors, but a very bad, dull and boring plot. The excitement level was at zero, and so was the suspense. The director and producer of this film did a very bad job, and made this film difficult to watch. The trailer was so good for this movie, but the movie was nothing like the trailer. I can describe this movie with one word... BORING!"
2,DeNiro is only star in this so-so crime drama.,"This film is disappointing, considering the acting talent used in it. The story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble, and is supposedley framed. His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime. It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull. There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie. It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film. If you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame, try recent movies like Along came a spider, Man on Fire, or Collateral. Deeper plots without the predictable outcomes."
1,Totally Garbage,I thought this movie would never end. It just kept dragging on. This was not a good roll for Robert DeNiro. I was expecting action and adventure but all I got was drooping eyelids.
4,A fast paced thriller!,"City by the Sea is a great movie! I enjoyed the irony of it. A father, played by Robert DeNiro, is trying to convince his son to turn himself in, while at the same time prove he's innocent! Corruption and Betrayal run high! There are many great actors in this film and it is produced well. I don't understand why more people were not talking about this excellent show when it came out in theaters, I guess everyone has an opinion."
3,inaccurate description,"The description states that +/- pregnancy test will be sent with the tip turning pink. However, digital ones were sent. The shipper needs to get their products straight."
2,I hate these,I get so many false positives with these. They leave evaporation lines that can drive you up a tree if you scrutinize these things. Don't bother with them. Use First Response orWondfo Pregnancy Test Strips
3,Not digital as stated,"The description is misleading...it states that 5 digital pregnancy tests are included, but it actually includes 5 regular +/- tests."
4,Good Price and Good Lens,"I have been using the black intl' version of this lens or some time now (I think) and I have been quite happy with it, except that that if you like using Canon's the direction you have to twist your hand to zoom is the OTHER WAY as with Canon! It's a small annoyance, but yes it will get you frustrated if you turn the lens one way to zoom but start pulling back!The zoom is slow compared to the new USM's from canon, and it seeks a lot. At the far end of the lens spectrum (about 130-200mm) the lens gets really dark and the picture quality degrades, and since the lens gets longer every little vibration in your body gets exaggerated if you are using a long exposure (on a canon 10D around 1/30 or longer).This is a solid buy but honestly I think that if you can afford the extra cost invest in a Canon lens."
2,Shrinkage!,"These shrink BAD! They barely fit the bed and after the first wash it was harder. Now, it takes the both of us reefing on a corner to get it to go over the edge. They seem to be pretty stain resistant which is good. Nice color and nice feel, they just don't fit :("
1,Another disatisfied customer...,"I made the mistake of purchasing 2 of these since I believed US Robotics to be a quality brand. Both stopped working after about 7 days, wouldn't work on WinME, WinXP or Win2kPro. Couldn't find anyone to contact and gave up."
2,Disappointing after all the hype,"This little modem, was supposed to be jewel of the dial-up modem range. Capable of handling the new v.92 standard among other things.Plugging in was not point and click, and drivers needed to be installed first. After which i unsuccessfully got the thing working with my isp.eventually after much sweat and altering of the myriad of settings - which makes it difficult to navigate, time consuming and unless you're a techie, useless - got connected at 12 kb/s. I checked the line, and computer settings, but no luck at increasing the bandwidth.The hype of such a modem has gone to the heads of its maker - it doesn't work properly, and needs to be corrected.All in all it was a shocking disappointment. On the positive side, the fax part of the modem works beautifully with no hassle whatsoever - how strange?"
2,No Linux Support,"This may be a fine modem, but it requires proprietary drivers that are not available for Linux."
1,Couldn't get it to work in Windows XP,"The first warning of trouble was when Windows XP warned me that the drivers for this modem were not signed. The next sign of trouble was that when I established a connection, the speed was almost always inferior to what I'd been getting on my old Creative Labs V90 external serial modem. The final straw was that after any period of use, the drivers would crash Windows XP.Maybe it's just my USB 2.0 card ... Or maybe it's just the way my machine is configured. But for whatever reason, I couldn't get this modem to work without poor performance and crashes. I have no choice but to return it and either look for another modem or continue using my old one.For what it's worth, I have had mixed results in the past with other USB powered devices. I've been bitten several times by devices that draw power through the same cable they send and receive data through. I will be very reluctant to buy such a device again."
2,"This modem only works on my USB 1.0 ports, not USB 2.0","This was not a conclusive test but the modem only worked on my onboard USB 1.0 VIA 82C596B controller and not my NEC USB 2.0 PCI adapter.If you're having problems, try a USB 1.0 port."
5,PERFECTO!,Me llego en plenas condiciones y en un estado mejor que nuevo! Muchas gracias!! Desde Argentina. Perfecto el disco en vivo.
4,One of Lee Joon-ik's earleir and better works,"Found this at the local Hastings. Had heard about it. A crib sheet on the Korean Three kingdoms could help a non Korean viewer, and since access to the script is via subtitles, a lot of the points will be missed. However things get clearer on a second viewing. One of the better ""war is created by men for their own crazy reasons "" films I've seen. Could be interesting to those fortunate enough to enjoy KBS's ""King of Legend"" which is sort of a prequel to the events depicted here."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER!,"This was the first Gwar albums I ever had. I wasn't a fan of Gwar until then. How could I have been? Hell-O came out when I was 1. I first heard this from a friend at school who later dropped out. I love this album. I originally only wanted it for the language, but when I matured and the swears weren't as funny as they used to be, I started listening to it musically. I have trouble picking one genre to call this because it transitions all over the place. I love all of the songs. I don't understand why my CD says censored version, but hey, it sounds good to me."
3,NOT GWARS BEST,THIS ALBUM WAS REALLY NOT THAT GOOD.IF THEY WANNA IMPRESS ME AND MAKE ME LIKE THEM AGAIN THEN THEY SHOULD DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SCUMDOGS
2,Not the best,"GWAR had kind of a low spot with this one. I can only think of 2 songs I really liked, ""Jagermonster"" and ""F..G an Animal."" This particular tour was good as the show was very entertaining (the last I believe with Hunter Jackson), but the CD was lacking."
3,Not such a big hit I thought it would be for her,"I saw this online and had to get it for my 1 year old girl. She hasn't played with the cube at all, but she does like the ball. Kind of a hefty price for it, but overall it's okay."
3,Boy,"My son enjoyed these toys, especially the ball. It is soft and we would roll it to each other and throw it. It won't damage furniture, etc."
4,Babies just love it,"There's something about the combination of color, feel, sound, and the crinkly, crunchy texture of filling in this toy that babies just love. Babies need and seek out sensory stimulation in order to learn about the world, and this simple toy has it all- sound, sight, and feel. Highly recommended."
3,I have two kids - 1 loved it and 1 never gave it the time of day,"The block was never used by either of our two kids. My daughter didn't care at all about the ball. My son, on the other had loves it. He is starting to crawl. He rolls it across the room and crawls after it. It's his favorite toy."
5,Really a fun addition to your kids toy collection,I bought it for my nephews (twins) and they absolutely loved it. if only all problems could be solved by a brightly colored cube and a sphere!! they are a great gift for any kid. durable and yet soft. spread the joy with this toy!
4,perhaps you're missing something...,"While Sexing is not my favorite Winterson novel, I can't help to reply to comments about it being disorganized and cobbled together from random plotlines. Just a suggestion to all of you, even those who have read it and liked, try reading The Four Quartets by T.S. Eliot first and then go back and reread this book. I think you will discover something interesting..."
3,my least favorite winterson novel,"In general, I love Jeanette Winterson. Her style reminds me vaguely of Joyce, and some of her other books really resonate for me. I wasn't impressed with Sexing the Cherry, though. I didn't care for the violence - I understand it makes the characters more complex and all that, but it just... wasn't so enjoyable to read. There were bright spots, but I wouldn't read this as an introduction to Winterson."
1,"Tedious, unstructured and unsatisfying",This has got to be the most overrated book I have ever read. Thankfully it's only about 160 pages. The entire book I kept waiting for something to justify the lofty reviews and high praise. Instead I found myself laboring through a murky mess of occasionally interesting prose halfheartedly woven with blurred story lines and unappealing characters. I had a headache half way through and it never got any better. I have a hunch that people say they love this book because it's the PC thing to do simply because it is an author who writes about gender/sexual identitiy issues. This book was too tedious to read for me to even care about trying to find her message...
3,Sexing the Cherry,"I had to read this book for our book group. It was hard because I only read at night before bed, not every day, and so there were gaps between my times of reading. I always had to go back and read what I had read before to make sense of what I was reading. I don't like the way the book is put together, switching from one character to another and one time period to another constantly. However there were very beautiful passages that I enjoyed very much. I would never have chosen to read this book but I am glad I was forced to do so despite its difficulty."
2,Just plain weird,"This one was chosen as a book club read. It was a strange book. Sometimes it seemed like the author was in a drug induced state when writing certain scenes, like the suspended dining room with alligators below. Some book club readers enjoyed this book, but for me it was just too out there. I didn't finish it and didn't actually get what the point of the story was as it kept leaping from one fantasy world (or mental state) to another without any links. There are lesbian references, like the different take on ""The 12 Dancing Princesses"" who get married and all leave their husbands for women or mermaids. Like I said, it jumps around all over the place! Not a book I would recommend. But hey, that being said, it's always good to read something different."
4,Just breathtaking,"This is the first Winterson book I'd ever read, and I wasn't disappointed. The narration is ingenius, the imagery is so incredibly vivid ind the characters are immensely rich. It's diminutive length makes it a quick read, though you'll want to slow down and savor it.This is such a masterfully written book that I really want to give it five stars, but I felt like the ending was inorganic. The rest of the book is so sly in blending its (distinct) feminist slant into the historical context that it doesn't feel preachy, but the end by comparison felt like a punch in the face.I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
1,Winterson's most pompous book to date,"Perhaps Jeanette Winterson knew the weaknesses of this book when she gave it the suggestive title. There is not much redeeming value to this pretentious work. Winterson, notorious literary snob, seems to have patched this story together out of half-baked plotlines and unfinished anecdotes of empty spiritual bombast. Read ""Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit"" instead."
3,"A wasted opportunity, her arrogance suppresses the ideas.","If you are the type to read a book and simply accept that the message is the important thing then this book is a winner for you. If you are easily offended by arrogance, pretention and over emphasis of a key theme then leave it on the shelf. The dog-woman is unquestionably the most beautifully hideous creation I have read from a writer of this century, and the linear nature of time is expressed well to begin with. Jeanette Winterson seems to get carried away however, and in her arrogance looses much of the subtlety that flavours the book to begin with so well. Re-reading this, it is her stubborn heterophobia that rings in the ears over any beautiful sounds she may have been making. This is disappointing from an obviously talented woman."
1,The Worst,Reading this book was one of the least satisfying uses of time in my life. It was as fun as eating fish gone bad. It's memory still haunts me. I would suggest picking a much better book.
1,This book is horrible!,Pretentious...confusing...annoying. It should be illegal to write a book that is this bad. Absolute drivel. Do something better with your time...like mow the lawn or cut your toenails.
5,Enticing architecture of language and narrative,"Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Winterson masterfully molds words like rebar to form a breathtakingly powerful constuction of a story. Winterson wields, rather than uses language.The reader is envboleped in a world wherre words are tactile with weight, smell and taste. And, this, is perhaps the best way to describe her writing. Winterson sculpts, constructs images and scenes from wrods that have bnoth weight and movement--so that the end result is an arousal machine that seduces both mind and body.The reader walks away covered in phrases, images, and scenes. And long after the text has washed away, familiar sounds and smell will bring the reader back to Winterson's world."
4,Better blades,"Always a pleasure to deal with Amazon.I am always trying to improve my craft skills, but sometimes it is very costly. These blades are a real improvement at a reasonable price!"
5,Great cutting 40 tooth blade,"I ordered this blade because I have an on-going project of deck remodeling that just seems to go on and on. I use mainly pressure treated wood (2x6's). Pressure treated stuff can be hard on blades. So far, used on three different occasions, this blade has been GREAT! It makes a very, very smooth cut....especially considering it's only a 40 tooth general purpose blade. I use it on my compound mitre saw. It makes ultra smooth cross-cuts and excellent mitre cuts. I'm extremely pleased with this baby so far."
1,Not complete,"I just got a new Kindle for Christmas, and this was my first purchase, as I am memorizing the poem. I am totally disappointed, because there are large sections of the copy missing - whole stanzas. Very sad first Kindle experience."
5,Durex are great condoms! I'm totally in love ...,"Durex are great condoms! I'm totally in love with them! These extra sensitive condoms are much better than the regular ones. My partner's able to feel a bit more sensation. Nothing's as good as non-use for sensation, but these are the best condoms we've found. I highly recommend them!"
4,"VERY handy, stable, not airtight?","I love the structure of this tool - stays on my palette well, perfect size, etc. However, the oil dried out (really thick and gummy) inside after a few weeks of non-use. The oil in my original bottle lasts for years without thickening like that. So I just need to remember to empty it if I'm not going to be using it in the near future. (like when I decide to do a watercolor between oils.) Would buy again, however, it still functions very nicely and I can close it up every day while I'm working on the painting.Later addition: I just took this to a workshop and left the liquid in the cups, and it was tipped around in my paint case...and leaked all over. So I re-emphasize that the lid helps but it not leakproof or airtight!"
2,Spool/line Advance Dont Last,"Works great for a few minutes but after some advancing, the spool tends to lock up...which you might think would work better if you didnt screw the cap on so tight...but then the little eyelet that the line feeds thru can fly off (and you have to order that online and wait a week). Which I did. But, that doesnt solve the problem...neither does WD40. Last time I used this, it took an hour to trim my short walk because I had to manually advance the line every 8 feet of work. Please do not buy this machine. I wish I had spent 3x more money to get something that simply had more than a 30 minute life to it. Such a shame that I need to throw out a perfectly good engine/handle setup because the spooling mechanism is so poorly engineered/manufactured. I looked for aftermarket replacements but they dont seem to exist. I will not buy Toro again."
3,Underpowered,I bought this for my mom to use. I thought it would have more power. She says it is adequate but not very strong. The smallest line size I've ever seen.
1,Shooting Flames & Billowing Smoke,"We received this item as a housewarming present. Warming is exactly what it did. The second time we started it up, it started shooting flames out of the bottom and smoking heavily. Needless to say, it went back to Home Depot where they weren't selling them anymore. I thought because of the ""Toro"" name, it would be great but, unfortunately our's was a lemon."
1,Don't have it shipped.,Just received this today via UPS. The box was bent and the handle inside was broken in half. Very poorly packaged by Toro and Target.com.
4,Decent tirmer for the money,"I have a small lawn, and this unit allows me just to plug in and go. Two things to note:1. The plastic string occassionally gets stuck, which is an easy fix to take off the spool and untangle.2. The unit is not long enough for me. I'm 6'4"" so I have to hunch over a little to use. But as I mentioned, my lawn is small, so I'm able to trim everything within 5 minutes."
1,0 stars - auto string feed is less than worthless,"Minus 5 stars! Maybe all weed whackers whack-it, but this one requires un-screwing the cover for the cord, roll out more string, and then screwing the cover back on - all just to advance the string. And this is necessary EVERY TIME the string gets too short to do anything. Does anybody know any really good electric weed whackers?"
2,Not Really a Toro; Hope It Doesn't Break,"My experience has been that Toro products are well made and dependable, but this trimmer turned out to be a flimsy Homelite trimmer in drag, according to my authorized Toro repair shop (they were having no luck getting replacement parts from Homelite). After a year, my trimmer needed a new part (the plastic cup around the cord with a guide hole in it); they wanted to charge me $38 for it, plus $25 labor! That's more than the trimmer costs and such a ripoff that I won't buy another Toro, period (needless to say, I passed on the repair)."
4,Electric trimmer,This Toro trimmer works great and it is very light ! it is good for my size and fit like a glove . Thanks .
2,"Cheap Plastic, Not much power.","I purchased this last fall. I used this for about 3 weeks before the plastic shaft cracked, I was able to repair the crack temporarily but it never felt solid after that. This spring it broke for good, pushed it to hard and it ceased up after getting too hot. I am sticking with gas, they are just more solid."
4,cool,I can fit quite a few items into my new Jimmie lunch box. I wish the side outer pockets could hold bottles of water though. Go team #48.
4,good overview of antique tools,This book provides a good overview of many tools (including a lot from obsolete trades). Some prices are provided. A good book for a beginner looking for background on the many tools out there.
3,Wise,Embrace the fear of living.Don't live in the future.Live now.A great book to pacify your mind.Feel free.
5,A must buy for anxiety sufferers!,I suffered from anxiety disorder following a psychotic reaction to marijiana.Two and a half years into my disorder I discover this book.BAM! It changed my life. Watts seems to understand instantly the vicious circle that is an anxiety disorder - and the way out of it!Read this book and get your friends to read it!
4,Letting Go and Letting God,"Invoking the type of spirituality long professed by recovering alcoholics and members of other twelve step groups, Dr. Watts encouraged his readers to embrace their insecurity in the world. According to Watts and other spiritual giants, the task for mature individuals was neither to deny their insecurity, nor to attempt to overcome it through their own efforts. Instead, he called upon us to admit our own relative weakness, and surrender to God those elements of our lives that we shall never control.In short he called upon us, in faith, to abandon ourselves to emptiness: the great mystery. Dr. Watts' framework was Eastern; primarily Buddhist, but the reality can still be embraced by all people of faith."
2,Just Wasn't Into It,"Maybe I'm just not into the heavily ""mystic"" (perhaps that's the wrong word) tone of the book, but I did not enjoy it for the most part. While his writing is often elegant, he seems to repeat his points over and over and over again. I get the feeling that this book could've been two-thirds of its current length if Watts would establish points and move on rather than dwelling on them for pages on end. That's not to say that this book is completely without merit or that others may not enjoy it. Rather, it just was too tedious for me.There was one chapter I found particularly interesting and that is the chapter regarding our awareness of time and, perhaps more accurately, our awareness of ourselves in time and its relation to anxiety. Perhaps in the future I will revisit this book and focus more on that chapter. For now, it's not for me."
2,Loveless,Not like other books of Watts I have read. Overly analytical and rather loveless. It could have been written by somebody else.
4,Offers a slight paradigm shift.,The book has alot for readers to think about but the content is a bit esoteric. One can find alot of insight for their personal life and be freed from conventional thinking. Hardly do I notice any un-heard of powerful devices in the book but it serves as an introduction to the basics of life changing paradigms. I recommend this book to those who have never been schooled in thinking outside the box or to somone who has experience with such principles and wants to enjoy an antiquated delivery of inner discovery. When I say antiquated I mean the opposite of theto-the-point and broken-down-in-simple-and-easily-understood-techniques like that of modern literature.I like the book anyhow.
3,over done,"""The Wisdom of Insecurity"" appeared to be a bit over done. Some very valuable points into a journey of self-discovery, however, too many words and not enough wisdom."
2,Too Enlightened For Me,"Strangely enough I found my way to this book because a journalist quoted a portion in an economic article. I was intrigued and maybe I had a pre-conceived notion of what it was about.At the risk of being labeled a candidate for remedial enlightenment 101, I'll be candid to say I found this book too convoluted and mystical. I just didn't get it. I kept trying to be enlightened but found myself disappointed at each turn of the page. At the end of my journey, I was glad to discard the book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,PHILOSOPHICAL PAGE-TURNER THAT MAKES SENSE,"As humans, we are forced to worry about the past and future essentially because there can't be pleasure without pain. The more we become more sensitive to pleasure the more we become sensitive and vulnerable to pain. We are never in the moment when we are thinking about the past or the future, and this is detrimental to our experience on Earth as we can never truly plan what happens in the future, nor fix the past. To be ""in the moment,"" one has to abandon these thoughts or else even temporary moments of bliss can be ruined by thinking about what's going to happen in the future. Essentially, human memory is considered a blessing, yet it is also a curse.FULL REVIEW HERE, WITH QUOTES[...]"
3,"Provocative Work, Yet Ultimately Unsatisfying","Molnar does an excellent job cataloguing and dissecting corporate involvement in education, and for that reason alone, this is a book that should be read by all those concerned with the changing nature of North American education.What was lacking in the book, however, was an explicit theorization of capitalism or the state. The involvement of business in education was seen through an overly conspiratorial light, which, in my opinion, obscures the real issues to a certain degree. The connections between educational restructuring, economic restructuring, and corporate involvement in schools should be made more explicit.But, a thought-provoking read nonetheless."
5,Brilliant explication of a serious problem,"Best argument I've seen for reigning in the unholy alliancebetween corporations and business. Read the chapter onExxon Mobil and ""Ecology"" modules for public schools andsee if you don't agree. Corporations are about public relations(i.e., lies). Schools at their best are about a search for thetruth. The two enterprises couldn't be further apart."
1,Propoganda,"Alex Molnar once again writes an anti-establishment and anti-business diatribe. He uses this book as a platform to prosletyse his personal views rather than looking at the benefits and disadvantages of having businesses involved with education.A classic example of his selective scholarship applies to educational text books publishers. These for-profit entities produce the core texts which teachers and students have relied on for over a century in the US. Almost all major US educational publishers are owned by Fortune 500 companies, who mandate they publish for profit. This has not created a perfect system for producing school text books, but no one can seriously argue that education would benefit by banning their involvement with schools!Alex Molnar would have you believe all business involvement with education is evil, however his thesis is undermined by a blinkered and narrow approach. This is an important issue which needs better analysis!"
4,Nice stainless steel burner,"I have a natural gas grill that is used year around. I had a cast iron burner for six years of weekly and monthly use. I researched and decided to get a stainless steel burner this time. After a month of use, it seems to do a great job. It's all I hoped it would be - IF it has the longevity that I would like. I would recommend the product."
4,"Overall, I was okay with the Daisy Plus ...","Overall, I was okay with the Daisy Plus Razors. They give you a very smooth shave, but if you're too fast, you get very bloody. I went on one leg slow, and with the other, which I had to hurry on, I went somewhat fast and got several deep cuts. These razors are good though, if you have time and want a good shave."
3,Daisy Plus Razors were shaped to shave curved ...,"Daisy Plus Razors were shaped to shave curved areas and did a nice job. However, I didn't notice any difference between the Daisy razors and other brands, as they all seem to have adopted this shape for women now. I didn't think it gave me as close of a shave as the razors that I normally buy, at a similar price."
5,diablo is the best,"Diablo is the best saw blade, once you have a little cordless 6 1/2 you will think it can be you best friend at times, the Diablo blade just brings it up a notch. Also best price."
4,mis-stamped,"I bought two of them and both burned my wood. Here the blades are stamped on the wrong side. I flipped it over and they work like Diablos' should work. I'm a contractor and I have or used at least 30+ blades in my life and never had that happen. I asked a friend who has been a contractor for 25 years and has never had that problem either. My circular saw is right-handed saw too. Anyways, when correctly mounted, it cuts like butter."
3,So so set.,"They are highly polished and the sizes fit good, the storage wrap is strong and uses a velcro strap. The down side is similar to another reviewer with a couple of sharp edges near the open end and one near the box end- it appears quality control did not catch these defects. Secondly, along the handle where it connects with the box/open ends there appears crimped areas where it was not forged properly, again a quality control problem. The crimpled area is a minor issue considering these are stubby wrenches thus not much applied torque, but the sharp edges present a problem when handling."
4,Great ecology book,We are using this book during Ecology Day Camp at the organization where I work. It is written in a way that is very understandable for children and the language and pictures are engaging. It does a very good job of helping children grasp the concept of succession and the broader idea of change in nature.
1,Paper on cubes peeling off,"I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old daughter and within a few days, the paper on the cubes started peeling off. My daughter loves puzzles but she hasn't been interested in this one. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product."
1,Great Idea - poor workmanship,"I had a puzzle cube like this when I was a child and loved it! So I was anxious to get one for my 3 year old who loves puzzles. The idea is cute, but the pictures peel very easily. No point in having a cute puzzle if you can't see the pictures. Don't buy it! I'd hold out for something of better quality or get another kind of puzzle."
1,Do not buy it.,I was surprised to see a Melissa and Doug product to be made so cheap.The sticker peels very easy.Terrible desing and a waste of money.
1,ONE STAR IS ONE TOO MANY FOR THIS!,"ONE STAR is too many for this one!Almost every other Melissa & Doug product we own, but this is terrible! I am so disappointd in this, the quality is terrible, something maybe I would expect from Walmart for $3, not Melissa & Doug.Save your money! It is very frustrating to spend money on soemthing that doesn't last at all. Not even a few months, we may be got a few weeks out of ours before it was ready for the trash!As the other review also states, the stickers come off as soon as you open it. I threw ours away, it was terrible. As suggested they need to change the stickers to paint or do somethng different.I wish I woudl have saved my money on this one!I love the idea, the puzzle is great, so great for learning little minds and so much fun, too bad the quality of this one happens to be so bad."
3,Harder than I thought,"I love Melissa and Doug products, so I bought this for my 12 month old for Christmas. I knew it was too advanced but I thought she'd like it anyway. Its so hard!!! What's good about it are the blocks themselves. They have a good size, weight and texture. My daughter loves stacking them (she stacks 6...she's only 12 months!) and banging them together. So, not great as a puzzle but great as a block toy."
4,good!,My 13 month old daughter enjoyed stacking the blocks on top of each other & knocking em down.Just don't let kids chew on them bec the paper peels off......
2,Hard,"At first I was excited to have a puzzle with more than one picture option. But, for a 3 year old, it's way too hard. I end up doing most of the puzzle as my child watches. He is 4 now and still needs major assistance to do it unlike with normal puzzles. The blocks are very well made, but watch out they become very big heavy missiles in the hands of a toddler boy."
2,not so great,one of the images didn't match so it will never make sense to my daughter. I'm sure if it did match it would be a great toy.
2,farm pictures are paper glued onto the wood!!,"i was very disappointed. we bought this for our 1 year old to practice stacking. he immediately chewed through the cheap paper stickers that are the puzzle pictures. also, the edges of the cubes are VERY sharp and the blocks themselves are pretty hefty. when a stack of them falls, get out of the way or you'll get hurt. overall i would not recommend this product"
1,Disappointing,I got this puzzle for my little girls birthday and she was so excited to open it. We soon found out that two of the blocks have incorrect stickers on their sides and therefore we can only complete 2 out of the 6 puzzles. Huge disappointment. This puzzle would be great and challenging for her age but unfortunately is impossible now that the stickers/pictures are all misplaced. I won't be purchasing any Melissa and Doug toys in the future without being able to look at it more fully.
4,My daughter loves it,I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas and she loves it. The 9 puzzles keeps her busy for a long time. My only complain is that cubes are very sharp. Its very easy to get hurt by them. It would great if the edges are made softer.
4,Well made,This item is constructed well so it should last. The child liked it and plays well with it often. Good purchase as a gift for a child.
2,"Great Idea, Bad workmanship","My daughter loves putting together this puzzle as it challenges her and has helped not only her spacial reasoning, but also her cognitive skills. However, like the other parents, I believe that this puzzle was poorly constructed. The paper peels off from the cubes, which is very surprising for a Melissa and Doug puzzle. I wish I could find another puzzle just like this one, but I don't want to waste my money on another puzzle that will fall apart like this one did!"
1,Poor quality - not what you'd expect from Melissa and Doug,"My 2 1/2 absolutely loves this puzzle and has no problem putting it together.However, the construction/quality of this product is horrible. The blocks are too heavy, so be careful if it falls onto a little ones foot. And because they are heavy, they hit together and the stickers are coming off the blocks. I'm so disappointed in this product. It looks like we've had it for years, when we've only had it for a couple months.This is not one of Melissa & Doug's better puzzles. Don't waste your money."
2,"Nice idea, but poor quality","The puzzle is cute and challenging, so my almost 3 hear olds will play with it for awhile as well as using the pieces as building blocks. However, the wooden tray splintered apart after just a couple of days. I have since glued it and they only use it with supervision, but it is a shame that the quality of this product is not higher. It makes me question other Melissa and Doug products."
3,Great Idea....poor quality,"I love the idea of this cube puzzle. I just wish it was higher quality. My daughter's are 2.5 and 4.5 and love playing with this. My 4.5 year old is at the perfect age for this puzzle. However, after only a week of having this puzzle the pieces are dented and dinged up and my daughters haven't even been rough with it. Some of the pieces are even bubbled up on the eges. I would like to buy more cube puzzles but probably won't buy Melissa and Doug brand again."
2,Disappointed,"I had a puzzle like this when I was young. SO much fun! I had this in my hand. I wanted to buy it so badly. But as I looked through the shrink wrap I saw the pictures were peeling off the cubes. I thought, OK bad puzzle. But then I looked at ALL the puzzles they had at that store....they were ALL peeling. Usually you can't beat Melissa and Doug quality but this time is not one of those times. There has to be a better way to put the pictures onto the cubes."
2,Very Disappointing Product,This is a very neat idea but the quality is poor. The pictures or put on with stickers instead of painted on. They were already showing signs of pealing up before we even opened the wrapper. This puzzle would be really great if made better.
1,"poor quality, don't buy","Actually I bought it from a local store, but it's exacty this one. What crappy quality!My toddler enjoys playing other puzzles; but for this one, she focuses on peeling off the paper instead (because it's so cheaply pasted on)."
3,Really disappointed by this Melissa & Doug,"we purchase a lot of Melissa & Doug toys for our child. Our daughter is our first child and we purchase these toys because we expect them to hold up for future kids. This toy however, like previous posts said does not meet that standard. The blocks don't fit closely together, which sometimes makes the picture seem distorted and even hard to interpret. The pictures (individual blocks) are fraying at the sides and corners, and also add to the pictures distortion.On the other hand, like all our Melissa & Doug toys, this does capture my daughters attention, and she is eventually learning to put the puzzle together herself.We got it as a gift and will prob buy it again for #2, however, I hope the quality improves by then."
1,Horrible,"This software has the worst way to teach a foreign language I have ever seen. They do not start you off on the basics, instead they start you on the most complicated verbs. They also never even tell you how to conjugate verbs in general, they only teach you by using examples."
4,Sign Offs - self-titled (Disaster),"From the address on the back cover of the CD,I believe Disaster is a subsidiary for the Bomp label.Not surprised because this here self-titled debut from the Cleveland five-piece is an above average effort of eleven cuts of in-your-face brash punk.Very good,for a pack of teens.Tunes I liked the best were the scorching opener ""Quicksand"",""Real Side"",the head splitter ""Sonic Shutdown"",""One Time Shot"" and ""Gotta Get Out"".Line-up is:Sim-vocals,Brian O'Brian-bass&vocals,Chris Churavy-guitar&vocals,Tim Long-rhythm guitar&vocals and Kris Monroe-drums.Comes with a 12-page booklet packed with black&white band photos and song lyrics.The band's influences come from the Dead Boys,Dictator and the Replacements.Check it out."
5,I liked The Gillette Agility Razors and would ...,I liked The Gillette Agility Razors and would recommend them to friends and family. The razors gave me a clean shave while leaving my skin smooth and silky. The skin moisturizers in the strip attached to the razor really seem to work. The razor design was extremely comfortable to hold and use.
5,Jazz Guitar At Its Best,"This record will be a revelation to anyone who loves straight ahead jazz, and especially jazz guitar. Roni is one of the most sensitive musicians playing in the world today, with a level of sophistication and wit in his playing that is comparable to the great masters of his instrument - Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Raney, Kenny Burrell and others who need not be mentioned. (They know who they are) His harmony is one rooted in the tradition of the masters, but never that of a copyist. I won't review the tunes, although it is great to hear someone other than Bud Powell play ""The Fruit"". In addition, Leroy Williams is a paragon of tasteful drumming and Lisle Atkinson is the perfect bassist to round out a band that has a clear, single minded vision of swinging with ease. A great record that will stand the test of time!!!"
4,Well designed,"Compact but pretty full-featured, this stroller was exactly what I was looking for. My one complaint (which is why I gave it 4 stars) was that the sun shade slips off easily."
3,Weight Limit,I was just about to complete my check out for this item and I thought I better check a couple other places on the web. My daughter is 3 and 39lbs. I saw that this Chicco stoller is for up to 37lbs on another site! sigh~ I thought I had the answer to my endless search. I wish the weight limits were easy to find on all the stollers as my daughter has not outgrown the ride yet.
4,In love with this stroller!,"After much struggling with finding a travel stroller for my well built 2 year old I finally found it. I had bought the britax stroller and it was wayyyyy to small for him, and very very heavy(and I feel Im pretty strong). Then I went to a department store and bought a 20 dollar stroller which had a reclining seat and a average size basket, again my boy didnt fit. I read the reviews of older children fitting in this one and since it had a slight recline, I thought this had to be it! As soon as I got it I took it out of the box to my surprise it was already assembled! And my child fits great in it. The only down side is that the basket could be a little bit bigger. Luckily my diaper bag has belt clips on the sides to snap on the handles. Overall a light , heavy duty stroller that does its job very well. Note: My main stroller use is taking it to the park and going to the mall."
1,Fishy tasting soup,This soup has a strange fishy taste and is way too heavy on the vinegar. I bought a case of this soup and am wondering what to do with the remaining 11 cans. Not recommended.
4,"God, Freedom, and Immortality","As the title suggests, Antony Flew's _God, Freedom, and Immortality_ is a collection of independent essays on God, freedom, and immortality. Some of the essays -- esp. the essays on ""The Presumption of Atheism"" and ""The Principle of Agnosticism"" -- are quite good. Others, however, wear their date on their face. His essay on ""What are Cosmological Arguments?"" does not even reference the kalam cosmological argument,which has become quite popular with theists since the writing of Flew's book. And his chapter on the free will defense defends the so-called 'logical' problem of evil by arguing for compatibilism, at the expense of neglecting the less controversial 'evidential' problem of evil. -- Jeffery Jay Lowder"
5,replaced the one I wore out,This is a cult classic. We poopoo the naysayers and look forward to this disfuntional Christmas tale year after year. Aren't those the best? GREAT soundtrack.
5,"We miss you, Stevie.","My wife discovered Jonny Lang, so I loaned her my Stevie CDs. Now I can't get them back. This puts together some great stuff, but I already had them all anyway except for Pipeline. Superstition was always a personal fave."
5,Pure Pride and Joy,"SRV gave a new spark of life to the dying blues. His simple lyrics cut straight to the heart. His amazing guitar playing can control your emotions. From the mellow ""Lenny"" to fast-paced ""Scuttle Buttin"", SRV truly knew how to manipulate emotion. He took a simple 12-bar blues and made accesible to anyone (ie ""Ain't Gone 'N' Give Up on Love"".) The only downside to this disc is the fact that is has to end. And just like SRV, it ends way too short."
5,A few duds mixed in with a bunch of classics. Excellent!,"I'm not sure who the creative genius was behind this combination of songs, but a couple of the 14 songs on here could've been easily left off. I don't care much for the live Stevie Wonder cover of Superstition or Pipeline, they don't seem to exemplify Stevie at his ""greatest."" But these duds can easily be overlooked when you have instant classics like Stevie's Hendrix cover of Voodoo Chile and Leave my Girl Alone. I've been cranking this CD in my car for 2 weeks straight now, and I have yet to grow tired of it. SRV is simply the greatest blues guitarist, ever.... I just can't wait for the box set."
5,The Sheer Rawness and power alone makes your body come alive,"As with most greatest hits albums, most of the hits are here, but ""Life by the Drop"" is one of the most incredible songs I have ever heard. I wish there was a live, extended version of it with Stevie jammin' like only the texas rocker can! Radford U. sig pi sig"
5,Best introductory SRV,"If you are new to SRV and looking for a great sample of his best work, this is the album for you. Selections are among the most intense blues ever to burn from SRV's guitar. The recording quality is top notch - including the live cuts."
4,"Not as good as Volume 1, but very solid","What you have here is Volume 2 of the Best of Stevie Ray Vaughn.Most of his great songs are on the first collection. The songs of note on this album are, Love struck Baby, Aint gonna give up on love, Leave my girl alone which is a remake of the Buddy Guy classic and finally the best song on the CD, Voodoo Chile (Slight return) which is a very close remake of the Jimi Hendrix classic.There is one song on this CD that is a real find and will attract your interest. The old hit from the 50's Pipeline is done on this CD and is played the way you would expect SRV to play it. Put on your seat belt when you listen to this one."
4,Great compilation,"Unlike the typical compilation album, this is a full-fledged tribute to the artist's music as well as being a compilation that works well at just being an album. Worthwhile both for long-time fans of Stevie Ray Vaughan and -- especially (needless to say) -- those who are new to his music and who want a taste. If you are one of the latter and are thinking about purchasing Greatest Hits then you should get this album instead. This one feels like a Stevie Ray Vaughan album whereas the other does not."
1,The item does not work,The lens advertised for Sony A330 but it does not work. I sent the item back and a replacement item sent but later on found out that it does not work for the camera. Poor product knowledge from the seller worst customer service.
4,An excellent les for the price,"Bad out of the way:1. Not particularly strong at flare control2. Like all zooms with this range, low light situations aren't that great.Good stuff:1. I would love to upgrade to the 18-250 from Sony... but... I keep asking myself if the extra 400 is worth the marginal increases on the wide and long side. With the quality images I'm taking with this particular lens - I can't say it is.2. Very very light compared to lenses with VR or IS built in. Sony/Minolta doesn't suffer this issue due to built in stabilization.3. My copy was nice and tight. Haven't had to use the switch to prevent lens creep - yet I could still very easily move it by hand.Would definitely recommend as the first lens for anyone starting photography. Bring a flash, or a 1.8 prime for indoor situations."
3,Not Chinmaya's finest,"Chinmaya Dunster's music - including 'Celtic Ragas' and 'Karma Circles' - is among the most sublime, spiritual, and almost magical music of recent years. His combination of Indian classical music with Celtic folk traditions is more than the sum of its parts: it's a uniquely beautiful creation. However, this title disappoints, with its disco beats and overtly commercial feel drowning the spiritual and artistic elements. Those familiar with Chinmaya's past output will probably be disappointed by the approach on Yoga Lounge."
3,Ok. Not as good as Life's little instruction book.,Ok. Not as good as the authors other more famous book - Life's little instruction book which I turn to very often.
4,Excellent teaching tool,"I found a lesson plan that I used this year, that was designed for use with the book. It is fantastic.I would recommend it!"
5,Adorable!,"This book has MANY quotes from people of all ages regarding life. Some are somewhat simplistic and some really get you to think. Topics include everything that life brings both good and bad...but I particularly enjoyed the ones about ""trust."" I had trouble putting it down and read the entire book (it is small...but thick) in a weekend. It reminded me of ""Life's Little Instruction Book,"" which is more direct/specific and one of my favorites. However, this one not only offers some wise insight, but just a little bit of cuteness is thrown in too."
3,"Cuts fine, but","This 50 tooth blade cuts very nicely - but there are evidently one or two teeth that are misaligned, leaving a scarf on rip cuts (it IS a combo blade). I'll probably not buy a Freud Diablo again, opting for higher end blades"
4,Excellent!,"VERY nice!! I've ripped and crosscut a bunch of walnut, maple, and curly oak. This blade performs flawlessly. The only knock on it, is that it's more prone to kickback than the blade it replaced, but using a pushstick eliminates that problem, too."
4,Blade of Blades,"good blade, what do you know, it cuts! Our space of 50 members haven't dulled it yet,,this thing is a pain wanting so many words to give a product review on a saw blade."
4,decent blade,"I bought this blade as a replacement for the very worn DeWalt construction blade that came with my DW745 table saw. At first, there was no immediate difference between the two... the Freud blade still burned every cut, especially crosscuts, and made rough edges. However, after I spent some time squaring the blade to the miter slot and re-aligning the fence, the cut quality increased greatly. Now it rips very cleanly with little to no burning, though crosscuts still get burned in hardwoods. Overall, not bad blade quality, though I was hoping for a little more."
1,"Freud 10""","Looks great, sharp as a blade should be. Can't use right now, nerve damage..in hand.Fits saw as it should."
5,Super smooth-cutting blade,"I bought this blade from Amazon for my table saw, as I needed to both rip and crosscut some 1&1/2"" oak butcherblock lumber, which is very hard. This blade goes through it very easily and smoothly with no excess heat or binding. This is an excellent combination blade, especially for this price. Recommended!"
5,Best I've tried,"Definitely more sensitive than any other brand I have tried. Highly recommended, and relatively inexpensive."
3,I don't think I'd recommend this type of ...,"I don't think I'd recommend this type of condom. While the condom wasn't irritating to my partner or me, we didn't find this condom to be """"extra sensitive"""" at all. It was just as sensitive as the condoms that we normally use. Also, when trying to remove one of the condoms, the latex broke. I'd assume this is due to the fact that the latex was thinner. Still, I wouldn't want to risk the latex breaking during intercourse."
4,"Great content, not so great writing.","The book describes the events leading up to the mision, as well as the preparations and the mision itself, in great detail. The scientific results of the expedition are also presented in a clear way. What in my opinion would have made this a ""great"" book, rather than a just a ""good"" book would have been better writing and handling of the story. Some parts which should have carried a lot of suspense and emotion (such as, for example, the launch of the Voyager probes, and the fears of a rocket failure that would have made all the efforts wasted) are handled in such a mundane way that it's almost boring. I continually felt that sections that would have been gripping were just ""one more paragraph"".There are also several editing mistakes, repeated words, mistaken sentences, and even repeated concepts and anecdotes. All in all, I got what I wanted (the story of Voyager and it's discoveries), but I'd have liked better writing."
3,Not the best Serkin survey of Beethoven's Five,"These concerti were recorded over a period of 2 years, and judging from the sound and spirit of the Concerto #1 it was tacked on almost as an afterthought. That is a pity. The Concerto #5 came out first as a single CD, followed the next year by #3 coupled with the Choral Fantasia on a single CD, and then numbers 2 and 4 together on a single CD. Number 1 was not available until this set of all 5 was released WITHOUT the Choral Fantasia. As that piece was a Serkin staple, it is all the more reason to be disappointed. Though there are some wonderfully thrilling moments in this set, it is no comparison to the wonderful Serkin/Kubelik set(Orfeo) from the 70's WITh the Choral Fantasia included. These were all ""live"" performances, beautifully recorded, and thrillingly performed and supported by Kubelik and his Bavarian Orchestra."
4,Ripping Only,"This blade is great for ripping with the grain. The thin kerf and coating allow it to cut with low resistance on underpowered saws. It will burn on wide crosscuts and cause tearout. Take Freud's description as gospel...ripping blade. If you need a general purpose blade, this is not it."
4,one use blade,"I bought this for resawing softwood stock down for spindle work. Not too much strain on the table saw and the pieces squared up nicely. Short of a couple hundred for a small bandsaw, I'd recommend it for such general resawing-ripping work. No flex in the blade that I can see, little burn or pitch build up--so far. For under $30, exactly what I needed. For hardwoods, I'd say the saw motor should be packing a lot of horses though."
1,Never Received Order,"I recently ordered a textbook from a third party through Amazon.com which turned out to be a bad experience for me. The seller never sent me the book and didn't bother to contact Amazon or me to initiate reimbursement of my funds. I contacted the seller after almost two weeks of not receiving the book and he stated ""The book was shipped... Standard shipping. Standard Shipping is media mail, it could take awhile.. But it was shipped.""(verbatim)It has now been over a month since I brought this textbook and never received. After contacting the seller a second time which he never responded I called Amazon.com customer service. I received my book from another website at a cheaper price, but I am still waiting for Amazon to reimburse my money. Therefore I cannot offer a rating for this product because I never received it from the seller (Sean)"
5,I couldn't stop reading it,"I thought The Witches would be boring. It sounded boring because of the name. The book is about a boy who gets turned into a mouse by witches. The witches also turned another boy into a mouse after the first one. Throughout the story Bruno, the other boy, and the boy's grandmother are trying to get back at the witches. My favorite part was when the boy got the witches back and turned them all into mice. I liked the ending because it was funny. I want to read it all over again so I can laugh all over again. If you like a funny book read The Witches."
5,witches,"i've never read this book (half way), but my teacher read it to me when i was 7, and i watched the film twice, i still remember how it goes, i have to say, the book is way better than the film. but my favourite part was when the grandmama was talking about the witches and her child hood experiences, i wish i know what exactly happend to her thumb!actually, the name of the boy was called luke."
4,Another Classic Roald Dahl,"Dahl has done it again in creating a fascinating world of fantasy that almost seems true. I liked the opening of the book best, when he's describing how to tell if someone's a witch. The descriptions are vivid and fun. I especially liked it when he tells you that maybe your teacher could even be a witch. Not my favorite Roald Dahl (BOY), but a great read, and, as always, much better than the movie."
4,It's good!,"It's a good book, with a lot of stuff children like, for example: the part of the spell, with all those things they had to but to boil in a cauldron. It shouldn't say it's better not to take a bath, children often do what they see, or read. But it was very good anyway, I liked it."
4,The Mice On High,A little boy and his grandmother go off to a hotel for the weekend. Come to find out his weekend turns into a tragic event when he runs into a group of witches. His life will never be the same. The little boy finds a evil plot to get rid of all the witches of England.this book was adventured packed book. I absolutly loved this book. The only part I did not like this book was the middle. My attention started drifting away. The begining and the end was very good. I liked this book but The Twits is still my favorit book out of Rould Douhl's colection.
3,The Witches,"While on vacation visiting his grandmother in Norway.A boy finds out, that he is going to be living with his grandmother for good.His parents were killed in a car crash.When the boy was at his grandmother's house, his grandmother tells him all about witches.The boy is turned into a mouse. Grandmamma helps the boy turn all the witches into mice.The chracter in this book are.The Grand High Witch, the boy, his Grandmamma,and his new friend Bruno. This is a good book, but I didn't like the picture very much."
3,What I think about witches by Antonio Fortes,"BOOM! Car crash- in a flash a young boy's life changes. An English boy goes to visit his grandmother in Norway. While there, his parents die in a horrible car crash. While in Norway,the grandmother tells him fascinating stories about witches. He soon finds out that his grandmother is a witchophile. A witchophile is a person who is an expert on witches. The boy is like all boys. He is caring and loving towards his grandmother. One day while on vacation at Hotel Magnificent in England, the boy gets turned into a mouse and has to come up with a plan to stop the witch from turning all the children of England into mice. The book is a little too long AND DRAGS but okay. You sould read the book. You will love it! byANTONIO FORTES"
5,My ALLTIME favourite!!,"This is a book I first read when i was twelve years old. Now, eight years later I have read it more than twenty times and I love it even more than I did the first time. Roald Dahl wrote books for both adults and children, and ""The Witches"" fits well into both categories. It is a book that makes you believe ( I must admit that I am always on the look-out for women with square feet and purple eyes...) A beautiful story, yet It will make your skin crawl...Exciting, mesmerising and cunning - clever, creepy and wise....need I say more?A CLASSIC for both children and grown-ups!"
4,shouldn't be missed..................,"I liked, enjoyed, and loved this book. Be it had some interesting facts and some incredible things in it. I also liked this book because, I have read other books that the author has wrote, and that is how I think that this book was. My favorite character was Brunal he was a funny character, and he was fat or chubby should I say. The best part of that book was when Brunal had turned into a mouse. It was the best part because one of the withes had turned him into one. The ending of the book was enjoyable, and surprising. You have to read this book because if you do not,you will be missing out a lot of things."
5,excellent but no ending,"The book was excellent. The book was exciting in everyway. It had adventure, action and disgusting things. It was scary especially the witch. Hope you get a chance to read it."
3,The Witches,"The book I am reviewing is The Witches by Roald Dahl. I think this book deserves three stars. It is O.K. This book is about a boy whose parents die and he goes and lives with his grandma, who teaches him about witches. A problem in this story is he meets witches. The witches turned him into a mouse and he wants revenge. I would recommend this book to people who like Halloween a lot. Other books by this author are The BFG, James and The Giant Peach, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and Danny Champion of The World.Emerson N.J. Fifth grade student"
3,The Witches,"I gave the book three stars becase some parts .I did not understand and some parts bored me!. There were parts in the book that made me smila ,like when ""Burno"" trun into a mouse ""Burno"" was fat and the Witchas gave him some candy a minate after he ate the candy he turn into a mouse .This was the funniest part to me because most little kids like to eat candy!I recommend this book to kids who are age from 8-12 .I think the kids will have fun reading this book becase it will scared them from eating candy i think."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Hello Guys! I am twenty-three years old, and I enjoy reading and especially writing. For those of you who read..Welcome! Everyone has their own tastes in books. When I was in fifth grade, my teacher would read to us. Sit us all in a circle while she read to us. The most memorable book that I recommend to read in a group is, ""The Witches"" By, Roald Dahl. To me this book took my mind right into the character. I became the child who hunted the witches. I enjoyed how my teacher read to us because she had so much emotion in her voice. I recommend that you share this book with everyone when reading."
2,Jeez,"If you look at the reviews on this book that are one starred, you will notice that most of them are angry at how witches are portrayed because Roald Dahl says 'real witches' and they assume he means Wiccans. He means the people you find in fairy tales, you morons, not Wiccans. I was amazed that people could be so stupid.That being said, I did not really enjoy this book. It was not funny and a bit gruesome. However, it was exciting."
4,imaginative,I bought this book as a gift for a pre-teen and she loved it. Although this book is not the writer's (Roald Dahl's) best it should be considered very much. She found it imaginative and very sweet.
5,antonio's review,I chose the witches because it seemed like an interesting book. It was about a grandhigh witch was tryien to turn every kid in england into a mouse. My favorite character was the grandhigh witch because she was gross and wicked. My favorite part was when all the witches took off their wigs and masks.
4,The Witches by Roald Dahl,"The Witches, is a very funny book. If you belive in witchcraft then you shouldn't read this book because this book had negative stuff about witches. This book said that real witches have no toes, bald heads, they are mean, always wear gloves and have curly fingers nails. This book talk about a boy whose parents died in a car accident. Now, he is staying with his grandmother at the hotel. He accidently comew across the real witches himself in the ""Grand High Witches meeting."" The witches were planning to turn all of the children in the hotel into a mice. Now, he had to save the children in the hotel by stealing the Witches's formula."
5,These complaints from Pagans are inane,"This book does not pretend to be representing the Pagan religion. It is not showing ""witches"" in the modern religious sense, but rather as the witches of the old traditional sense. If you are to complain about this book, you might as well complain against Macbeth, Wizard of Oz, and the entirety of Halloween. This is not political correctness, it is just an excuse for some people to complain."
5,THE WITCHES,The Witches is about a boy's parents who died in a car accident so his grandma had to take care about him.The grandma and him meet unplesant people.They went toa hotel that is called Hotel Magnificent and a suprise happened to the boy and another boy named Bruno. They turned into rodents. The boy wanted to turn that witch into a mouse too.Read more to find out.
1,It isn't very greusome...................,"It was a cold winter day. It was the day our teacher started reading us ""The Witches"", a popular book by Roald Dahl. A few days later I bought it and started reading. I would call this, next to ""The BFG"", Dahl's worst book. First of all, how could they kill every kid in the world, while there was only 85 of them?(in England, at least.) Secondly, we never find out Our Hero's name, not even his parents or grandmama! Thirdly, a mouse? Stupid. If you want ""real Dahl"", read the books that most people call ""Dahl's Greatest"": ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Matilda"". Including ""The Witches"" and ""The BFG"", these are the only Dahl books that saw the silver screen."
1,A Disgrace to the Pagan Religion,"This book in no way shows what real witches act like. With young children reading this book, they are getting the wrong idea about the Pagan Religion. It's bias and doesn't deserve to have the word Witch in the title. The Pagan Religion is dedicated to Nature, not little boys."
1,Witches is the dullist book I read,The book Witches didn't have enough action.I couldn't find the concept of this book. He didn't consiter the fact that there are good and bad witches. I'm just 10 years old and I can recognize bad writing when I see it!
1,I'm appalled,"This book is a horrifying social commentary on the opinions of people about real witches.If you want to know the truth about REAL witches, I suggest reading ""The Truth About Witchcraft Today"" by Scott Cunningham."
1,A Nasty Little Number,"""A REAL WITCH hates children with a red-hot sizzling hatred that is more sizzling and red-hot than any hatred you could possibly imagine....Her passion is to do away with them, one by one. It is all she thinks about the whole day long. Even if she is working as a cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman or driving around in a fancy car (and she could be doing any of these things), her mind will always be plotting and scheming and churning and burning and whizzing and phizzing with murderous bloddthirsty thoughts.""As a representative of the Neo-Pagan community I do not find this funny. Should I? Would any Witch wish for their children to read this? I don't think so. To get some idea of how offensive this is to a modern Wiccan/Pagan substitute the word Jew or Jews for Witch and Witches and then imagine that you are Jewish.Shame on you Mr. Dahl for writing it. Shame on you Puffin for publishing it."
5,Mrs. Hutton's 3rd Grade Class,"We read this book as a read-aloud. We loved this book! It was funny because the boy as a mouse swings around the kitchen by his tail and then it gets chopped off. Bruno, the other boy/mouse is a funny character because he keeps shoving food in his mouth all the time. We liked when the all 84 of the witches got changed into mice. It was great to see the boy get even with the withes by using the secret formula. We reccommend this book to any 3rd-5th grade class."
5,Favorite Story....,"The first time I heard this book was in my 4th grade class. I then ran into it again in the 6th grade and with fond memories picked it up and read it myself. It was as good as the first time, maybe even better. Now I am reading it again, almost 30 years later to my children. If you want to inspire your children to read this is the book to do it with. Filled with laughs and excitement...you and your children will be on the edge of your seat or falling off with laughter!!"
3,A little disappointing.,"I finished reading this book for about the 3rd time in my life and I thought it was really disappointing - I suppose I was younger when I first read it and so that's why I didn't enjoy so much this time.Like most of the other reviewers say, this book has some problems - it is veryyyyyyyy unrealistic and too scary for children under the age of 7."
2,I like this book because it tells you about what wtches do.,The witches were the important characters because thats mostly what the book was about. The witches were ordinary women but they were not nice. I dislike this book because I do not like witches at all and I don't believe in them.
1,DO NOT READ,"I would give this book 1 out of 5 starsRoald Dahl is a twisted author and this book has a lot of twisted elements in it. The book wasn't the worst Dahl book. The book would not sit well with younger kids under 7.The main character has NO name witch really annoyed me. The book also ends on a horrible ending that all the hope for a great ending dies.In the book the kids parents die when they fall of a cliff. The kid goes and lives with his grandma. She tells him witch stories. Then they go on a vacation and that's when the adventure begins.I would not recommend this book to a friend unless he or she is sick, twisted, or demented.Conclusion : DO NOT READ"
1,Witches,"The book the witches by Roald Dahl was not a very good book. It is about a grandma that loves to tell her grandson fariytales and one day he hears that witches are real. What will happen?? The main characters are The Grand high witch, Bruno, Boy, Boys grandma and the witches. I did not like this book if you like action/adventure don't read this book. I would rate this book a one on a scale of one to five."
4,Witchly Fantastic!,I thought The Witchs was a great book! It was very exciting every time the boy tried to stop the witches. Some parts are very funny like when the grandma dances around waving her cane in the air. I think most of his books are good but this one is great! I strongly suggest you read it too!
4,Good Power Strip,"Each outlet is labeled which helps in identifying your device when needing to change or move it. We have had this since 2009 and we have gone through thunder storms, power outages, etc... and we have not had any issues with our electronic devices. Also, the thinner long design was easy to conceal behind the TV stand."
4,Monster HTS 950,"I gave 4 stars not for the quality of the product. This is very well built, looks very nice too although it is placed in the back of the stand so I have not seen it since I installed it. The price is on the high side. You can buy much cheaper items that do the same job. If you do not mind the cost this is a very good item."
3,It's Just a Powerstrip,"This is a surge protector. It looks cool, but you can't see it. The manufacturer brags about a lot of fancy features that I don't understand. I can't tell any difference in output quality with my equipment plugged into this surge protector as opposed to my old surge protector. It has a lot of room to plug in a lot of items, and I appreciate that. Overall, it's quite adequate. Why three stars? I got a relatively great price on it here on Amazon, and yet the price in proportion to the product is still astounding."
1,bad customer service,This was an awful compnay to work with - we received a broken item and it is essentially a loss to us.
4,Saying What's Real - Read Getting Real First,"Getting Real, Saying What's Real, and Truth in Dating are three of Susan Campbell's books that I have been reading and rereading recently. These books are making a difference in my life.Keeping relationships alive and living life fully - this is what Susan's books address.She has a lifetime of experience working as a therapist, author, coach, and consultant. Based on this experience, she has developed a set of simple principles and tools that we can apply every day of our lives.I find her ideas very helpful in looking at past relationships - what went right and what went wrong. I feel much more optimistic about creating a solid relationship in the future.Susan is an excellent writer (and teacher). I recently attended a workshop that Susan lead. I found her to be unpretentious and personable, as well as a good teacher.I highly recommend her to you."
3,Enjoyable Read but.....,"Friday Nights at Honeybee's was an enjoyable read. Although I enjoyed the book, I gave this book 3 stars because I was disappointed that Viola did not return to her birthplace to confront her parents. One might say it wasn't worth it; however, it was never discussed in the book how she overcame (other than physically removed) the situation with her parents. Overall, the book was delightful. I enjoyed the author's description of the jazz and blues lifestyle."
3,2.5 Stars,"I really wanted to give this book a chance, because it has good reviews. But, I'm sorry I just couldn't get into it. And because I didn't finish it, I didnt want to rate it too low. May be a good book, but I don't have the patience to wait for it to speed up."
3,Just ok,"The shirt was everything I wanted it to be, but it was not good quality. After wearing it only a few times holes starting apperaing in the fabric. Very cheap material and not worth the price. Blah."
5,Excellent Blade for the price,"I use this blade on a Hitachi Sliding Miter Saw with excellent results. I prefer Forrest Blades for the ultimate in fine work, but this is a good substitute for a lot less money."
5,Nice clean cuts,Freud D0860S Diablo 8-1/2-Inch 60 Tooth Fine Finishing Miter Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch ArborI purchased the saw blade to put on my miter saw. I am using it to true up all of the walnut lumber that I am using to build two trestle tables and benches. The blade gives nice clean cuts without splintering. Nice mirror like cuts. Good value when considering the value of the walnut that I am cutting!
2,whoa slow down !,"Amazing keyboard player but their songs need some help in the arrangement department. I guess these guys took lessons from Dream Theater. Sometimes a little brevity is a good thing in music. Keyboard player will have a lot of ar""tension"" and arthritis if he keeps playing like that."
3,Melissa and Doug Stamp Set,"Very iritated that this didn't come with a cover. My 4 year old is very bored with this. She is not artistic type, basically this just ads to our unused toy collection."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes but I'm disappointed. First, there is one ink pad divided into two colors rather than the two separate ink pads listed in the descriptions and shown in the picture. Second, the ink is so dry that I have to help my son (2.5yrs) get the ink onto the stamp. Then even I can't get the stamp to look good. If you press hard enough to get the whole image to show you also get some of the background. Also the lines aren't a solid color. Within a small section of a line there are dark and light spots. Finally, the stamps are so tightly crammed into the box that my son has trouble getting them out."
5,Great buy for young kids,Our boys loved this set. Great for young children as the older ones get bored too quick. I would say 2-4 maybe 5 would be the best age range. The 6 year old doesn't have any interest in it but the 3 year old still loves playing with it. Great for boys and girls.
4,Stamp set,"Very nice selection of stamps and great that the colored pencils are included to complete the artwork! Honestly, though, the ink pad was replaced almost immediately."
3,Okay,"The kids liked the stamp set for about 15 minutes, then it was all over with. Quality construction and nice concept, just not enough to keeps the kids interest."
3,"Comes with only 1 stamp pad, not 2.","I was expecting this to have 2 separate stamp pads, one in red and one in blue as shown in the picture. I am giving this to my 2 nieces and was excited that they would not have to share the stamp pad. Unfortunately, it arrived with only 1 stamp pad with 1 red side and 1 blue side. I am not happy about this. I am keeping the product anyway because I like the stamp pictures, but will now need to buy a separate stamp pad."
3,the stamp is too small,"When the small stamps like the frog, sun, etc are used, the imprint is much smaller than what I expected. Also, my child has to press real hard on the stamp to get an imprint. The color pencils are not that great quality. I am typically very fond of Melissa and Doug products, but this product did not meet my expectations."
4,stamp set,My daughter who is almost five likes this. She has used stamps before and she thinks it is cool because it comes with pencils to color in the stamps. Good gift. creative gift.
4,Stamps,"While I'm currently running an active stamp ban in the house due to stamps on the LCD, stamps on the walls, stamps on the anything in arms reach, etc. It was great fun when it was confined to paper! the kids loved it."
4,These are fun for the kids,"The rubber stamps are sturdy and interesting. They come in three different sizes, and it came with a blue and red ink pad. The ink pads were pretty dry when we received them which is why I'm giving this four stars. The stamps themselves are very well made however, and should last a long time, we will just have to purchase more ink pads."
5,A Great Book Especially for Kids!,"My mom bought me this book back when I was little and it was the starting point for me in learning the art of sculpting. The lessons are easy to understand and fun to do so both kids and parents can sculpt together. It can really inspire a creative side in your children that you may not have known was there. Little did my mom know when she bought me this book, years later I would run my very own successful sculpting company. Thank you Barbara Reid for creating such a wonderful book for children!"
4,Ideas for crafty afternoon,"Described basics things, plenty of ideas, however I miss a little bit real basics - how to get to final product. I needed a bit of experience from elswere."
5,Macbeth (Norton Critical Editions),"It's hard to beat Norton Critical editions in general for both source material and a range of critical articles -- not to mention abundant footnotes. If it isn't Norton Critical edition, it's not as complete a package as it should be."
3,Does not fit Jeep Commander!!,"Wounldn't normally bother leaving feedback, but got to let my fellow jeep commander owners know.. this product does not fit a jeep commander, go for the Atlantis or spirit. (they do fit because they have a different clamp system) 3 stars, not 1. its probably a great product. unfortunately i'll never know!"
4,scottish romance,"believable characters and story, good lusty romance. This kept my interest peaked and pages turning to see what would happen next!"
2,Could've been better,"The story line sounded good and the 5 star reviews swayed me into buying the book. It could've been good but I just couldn't connect with and like the hero and heroine. Some words within the book wasn't in keeping with the general feel of Scotland of that era, as the heroine asking for a report of what was discussed between the lairds. All the hero and heroine seemed to be doing was having sex. The hero could only think with his _____. The heroine knew about the risks about being called a witch and yet she didn't do anything to at least temper her activities so that she gets accepted first. I have read a lot of Connie Mason's books and have enjoyed them immensely. This book just didn't seem to be up to her usual standard."
1,Atrocious,"Absolutely terrible. I tried valliantly to read this book, but found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages and eventually entire chapters. In the end I deposited this book where it belongs, in the garbage."
5,HISTORICAL ROMANCE AT IT'S BEST,"I LOVE TO READ!..SUSPENSE, THRILLERS, MURDER MYSTERIES, MILITARY ESPIONAGE, AND ROMANCE!!! WHEN I WANT TO READ A ROMANCE, CONNIE MASON NEVER FAILS ME. I LOVED THIS STORY, WITH IT'S RICH HISTORIC BACKDROP, WITH THE EMOTIONS OF TWO PEOPLE TRYING TO PROTECT EACH OTHER BY KEEPING SECRETS. THIS IS THE STUFF OF ROMANCE. THE SEX IS HOT, THE PLOT IS ENTICING (WITH A TOUCH OF MYSTICAL), AND THE CHARACTERS COME TO LIFE. CONNIE MASON HAS A WAY OF PULLING YOU INTO A BOOK; WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF CLOTHING, CUSTOMS, AND THE MIND SET OF THE TIME PERIOD. I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM THERE. I ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING.BUT OHHH, DO NOT FORGET THE LOVE STORY. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, EACH PAGE HAD ME WANTING TO KNOW MORE. I FOUND MYSELF WORRYING ABOUT HOW THINGS COULD POSSIBLY WORK OUT, BUT THEY DID.AN EXCELLENT ROMANCE, SPELLBINDING TO THE END, LIKE ALL CONNIE MASON READS!! I KNOW THIS IS A GOOD BOOK BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE SAD WHEN I FINISHED IT, I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT GO."
4,Second series,"I am enjoying these books very much. I was disappointed at first that they did not follow Firestar any longer, but they are good all the same.:)"
4,warriors moonrise,"it was a great book!! i would recommend it to any one who loves cats and/or this series of books.it was kinda confusing when (Erin hunter) changed the focus from bramble to stone but overall this is a great book and i love the series of warrior cats its a must read series for younger children, older children,teens, and even adults !!"
4,Very Good,This one is better than the first new prophecy series. It is intriguing and was worth it. The plot was simple but does twist when you least expect it.
5,Wariors: Moonrise,"It was a really good book! I finished it in just a few hours! I have read all the Wariors books, and I own every one. I can't wait for the next book to come out! I will pre-order it as soon as I can!"
5,READ IT,"DON'T DO LONG REVIEWS SO JUST READ AND IF U HATE IT THEN OK BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!May StarClan light your path,Blazeheart, the newest warrior in FireClan"
2,"Good,But Not as Good as The First Book","The first book to Warriors The New Prophecy was very good,but this book was ok. I think she focusses to much on the tribe of rushing water and their prophecy. Also she made Feathertail the cat to the tribe of rushing water's prophecy and then she killed Feathertail and on top of that the cats of the tribe of rushing water didn't thank her or grieve for her when she dies. That was her down fall when she wrote the book ,but overall I though it was an ok book."
4,loved but not as good as i hoped,it was good but not as good as the older ones i recomend it but i recomend others first i lowed it one star because it wasnt as well written
3,why?!!,"For others who read Midnight and Moonrise back to back, did you notice there was a replication of an entire chapter from Midnight (one of the last when the cats are leaving the sea cliffs) to chapter 5 of Moonrise? I don't know what on earth happened but I'm assuming that it was done deliberately since the story flowed through both chunks of either book in the right places and the details for terrain description were adjusted. Rather annoying realizing a whole chapter was transferred over. I personally liked Midnight better than Moonrise as this book moves a lot slower and the way the story functions with the mountain cats, at the moment feels like filler. Hoping that changes in the next one. I don't know how intentional it was, but Sharptooth also seems like he could've been named better. I had a really hard time trying not to picture a tyrannosaurus rex (Land Before Time) as I was reading."
5,Great reading,"The book starts right where Midnight ended- the questing cats are now heading back home, wondering as they go how they will break it to their clans that they must leave the forest that they have lived in for generations. They come upon a Tribe of wildcats in the mountains- cats with different anscestors and different lifestyles, yet Stormfur feels strangely at home with them.... This is a great book for children and cat lovers like myself. For more cats stories reach forWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1."
5,This book is so good!,"Moonrise is a really good book, and I give it a five star rating. The cliffhangers keep you guessing: What's going to happen next? The Tribe of Rushing Water is mysterious, but also very generous and friendly. I have been a fan ever since book 1, ""Into the Wild,"" and I will continue to be a fan. I highly recommend this book to those who love the series. i'm not going to reveal any spoilers, but I'll say that this book was probably one of the saddest, as a major character dies. Meanwhile, back in the old land, the forest is being destroyed. The hostilities and boundaries begin to wear off in this book, and I think that the journey and series itself is a change woth reading about. This book continues that marvelously spun series, and Erin Hunter triumphs again. You'll just have to read in order to find out for yourself."
5,Moonrise,"As the sequal to Moonrise, you get the point of the book from Stormfur's point of view. Going a ""quicker"" way home, they encounter a tribe of cats. Stormfur can't understand their fascination with him, but when he learns about it the effect is devastating. Meanwhile, Stormfur is feeling interesting pangs for a tribe she-cat, and he is feeling pangs at seeing Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw so close. He is feeling very protective of his sister, who is in love with the wayward WindClan apprentice, Crowpaw.Back in ThunderClan, Leafpaw's world is crumbling around her. The WindClan cats are getting more and hostile, while ShadowClan's hostility doesn't rise. RiverClan is full-fed and happy, the only Clan that is. When Leafpaw figures out who Hawkfrost reminds her of, it shocks her. Could Tigerstar really be Hawkfrost and Mothwing's father? He certainly could be, and Hawkfrost's ambition isn't making Leafpaw any less suspicious."
2,Took way too long to recieve!!!,I placed this order on 9/07 and received it in the mail on 9/27. When I first placed the order I was not told it would take this long to receive my book. I have never had to wait this long on any other amazon order I've placed. Since placing this order my son found the book at the library and is almost done reading it. I have no use for the book at this point. What took so long???
5,a great rising,After Midnight I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the writing but with moonrise it came up alot so I really recommend this book.
5,diccionario español-inglés,"he conocido este producto al comprar el diccionario inglés - francés.Lo encuentro muy útil, ya que es todo el vocabulario cotidiano el que aparece, y addemás es ilustrado, lo cual identificas exactamente loq ue quieres buscar.Estoy muy contenta y se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo."
2,Questionable Quality,"I was totally disappointed with the quality: Wonderwoman fell apart at the waist within a few days. The way they designed her leg joints has a lot to be desired. They are not robust, though they look cool. I would probably still buy this set, if the price was right."
2,Fed up with duplicates,"While the Doomsday figure looks pretty cool, and it would be nice to have Bizarro, I really hate it that they're dumping more Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman figures on us. I already have plenty of those, thank you very much. Notice that the box says the Doomsday figure is exclusive to this package, so if I want it I have no choice but to spend extra money on figures I already have.And a transparent Amazo? What kind of sense does that make?"
4,Outdated? - Perhaps,"The previous reviewer dismissed this as outdated and suggested if you don't already own an iPod, to avoid the book. I bought the book after making the decision to buy but before I had actually made the purchase. I'm glad I bought it. I found the book highly informative both in the features and use of the iPod but also with the iTunes software. For me, it is indispensible. If you're planning on purchasing an iPod, or already have one and are trying to get maximum functionality out of both the iPod and iTunes, this is money very well spent."
2,Give me the first two records instead...,"Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step."
3,Low point for Stevie--,I don't know whether the drugs were too much at this point or what but this is not the usual SRV album. No blazing solos or speedy riffs that leave you baffled. No tracks stand out overall. This album is not even comparable to Texas Flood or Couldn't Stand the Weather.
4,Excellent And Underrated,"This is an excellent and underrated CD. Just check out ""Ain't Gone 'N' Give Up On Love."" This is serious blues. Not his best studio effort but still excellent."
2,Not a good album from the greatest blues guitarist,"This album shows you what damage drug and alcohol abuse can do to a person. While that same abuse was a part of some unbelievable work prior to this, this is the down side of the arc.His playing and song writing here is uninspired. This is nothing compared to Texas Flood, Couldn't Stand the Weather and In Step, and those three are nothing compared to his live work (not Live Alive though). It is almost painful to listen to this knowing the hell Stevie and the band were going through.The only bright note with the reissue is the inclusion of a smoking version of Little Wing."
3,"No ""Little Wing/Third Stone from the Sun","I bought this CD specifically for the ""Little Wing/Third Stone from the Sun"" medley. Friends told me it was on this album and it was also listed as one of the titles on CD when I purchased it. But, it is not on there. WTF! Very disappointed."
5,WHAT THE HELL!?,"What am I missing here? This is an incredible album, even without the bonus tracks that make it beyond incredible. I think some SRV ""fans"" resent him making an album that has cross-over appeal. Hell, I would say ""Change It,"" ""Lookin' Out the Window,"" ""Look At Little Sister,"" and ""Say What"" are as good a songs as SRV ever did. But there are a lot more great songs as well. And he does throw a bone to the blues/jazz crowd with the songs ""Gone Home"" and ""Empty Arms."" Of course the two Hendrix bonus tracks will blow you away. I will repeat what someone else has already said, Stevie played Jimi better than Jimi played Jimi. To people getting into SRV, trust me, this is a great album."
1,Difficult to Use,"It's a good idea for a gadget; too bad it doesn't work well. It's challenging to load the stamps into it. It's difficult to align the stamps onto envelopes. The stamps jam in the roller. The empty backing is supposed to coil neatly into the compartment designed for it, but it wrinkles, buckles, and jams instead. I do NOT recommend this dispenser. Go for a simple plastic one, if you can find it."
1,Doesn't work. Period.,"After I bought this for use at work, the receptionist told me she had already bought one a while ago and it didn't work. I tried hard to prove her wrong. Actually two of us tried to prove her wrong but the item is extremely hard to use. The directions have an incorrect step and there are too many rollers within the unit that make the unit heavy and awkward to use. I had stamps all over my envelopes except where I wanted them. I even had one stamp on my desk!"
1,Useless,This is simply not worth the bother. Takes longer to load a roll of 100 stamps than put on by hand.
1,Did not work,"We mail 50-100 letters a day.Unfortunately, this is a good idea, but wasn't implimented right. Stamps would wrap around inside and eventually jam. We reverted to the $1 plastic stampholder provided by the post office.The vendor was prompt. shipping was fast. Product was far below par. It is not their fault."
1,Premier ez stamp affixer,This item doesn't work. It should be no stars. Now I understand why my local office supply store stopped carrying it...
1,Poor design,"This stamp affixer does not work well with stamp rolls with backing. The excess backing starts to roll up into the wrong wheel, causing the roll to get stuck. Also, it is no faster than just affixing the stamps manually. A complete waste of money - don't bother!This company took a long time to ship my order."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased two of these and ended up tossing them in the garbage. They were cumbersome, difficult to use. I ended up simply going back to hand application. It was faster."
1,Eats stamps,I hate this thing. I ended up returning it because it pulled the stamps off the coil and down inside the wheels of this item. You're better off getting a simple plastic holder.
1,"Save your money, this thing is junk!","I work in an office that sends 100-150 pieces of mail per day, and affixing stamps by hand has grown quite tedious. I saw this little gadget and thought it might be quite helpful and might even save me a bit of time.I couldn't have been more wrong!I think the best verb to describe using this machine is ""battle!""It's a battle to get the stamps loaded. It's a battle to attach each stamp. It's a battle to keep it from jamming, with the backing paper folding over on itself and causing the stamps to stick inside the machine where they cannot be retrieved.After using it for just one roll of stamps, I give up. The Premier EZ Stamp Affixer has won this battle. I will be returning it, and I expect a full refund. This product is defective and useless, and any review that gives it 5 stars is FAKE!!!"
1,Yes no faster than my hand,You will have to continually reload the stamps as the backing will break or feed back on it self jamming the device.
5,Mailing made easy,Have had one of these for years loved it needed one for club that requires me to mail a lot of letters. Post Office isn't smart enough to carry.
1,Waste of time,This applicator is slow and difficult to use. Save your time and money.It is quicker to apply by hand. The unit gets jamed easily.
3,Moves around a lot,We have a Britax Regent car seat for everyday use and bought the High Back for travel only. The TurboBooster goes in the car easily but shifts around on the seat a lot. We feel more secure with our child in the Britax Regent car seat because it doesn't move or slide but this booster seat is ok for occasional use.
5,loved it,This is the best booster seat. My son loves it and my daughter has a red version of this and loves it.
4,Good Value!,This booster seat came with a good price and had everything we needed! My daughter loves her big girl seat.
5,Booster Seat,"I am a fan of Graco as it is. This car seat is great. Very light, nice colors, and fits perfect in the car. Its not bulky at all. The delivery was very fast. The price of it was GREAT! It was the best $50 I ever spent."
3,Problem Sleeping,"The main problem I have with this product is the fact that my son slumps all the way over when he falls asleep. It's the most frustrating thing because it doesn't make me feel okay that he's safe in the seat. I've tried making sure the seat belt is locked to hold him but he still falls right over and I constantly have to reach back and push him up. Also, the cup holders are not that deep to prevent cups from falling out. Also complains about his bottom hurting and he's not sitting on anything except the seat."
4,Upholds Graco Reputation,"I like this seat, but agree with other reviews that it doesn't have much padding. It works, is safe, and my son loves the cup holders."
5,a must have for clean quick cuts,"Simply outstanding. I've installed 600 sq feet of 3/4 inch braz cherry hardwoods, all with my cordless and these blades. I purchased 3 blades and used all of them for this job. I ripped a few boards for the final row and the blade just cuts right through this dense wood. Just ordered 3 more for future projects."
5,Throw away that OEM blade and buy this blade!,"I used this blade on my 18v Ryobi to cut laminate flooring planks over the weekend, it did an excellent job. The cuts were clean, almost like someone sanded them. Cutting though some scrap 2x4 as a test was effortless with the Diablo compared to the OEM blade, which had a problem of sticking. I bought the Diablo because it wasn't that much more expensive than the traditional style blades. The Diablo blades are a huge step up from the OEM blades that come with saws and you won't be disappointed."
5,smooth as glass,"This blade gives cross cuts as smooth as glass! Very thin kerf, and high quality carbide. I threw away the blade that came with my saw!"
1,saw blade is very difficult tu use,"just too many teeth on this blade. it just robs alot of power from a cordless saw. i have used freud blades on all my saws,-miter, tablesaw etc and loved the performance of those, unfortunately not this one."
5,"Invisible, Constant Learning","I bought this placemat along with several others to periodically rotate between my kids. If they're in a quiet mood or are the last slow eaters left at the table, they often end up staring at the placemat, comparing planets, orbits, etc. Makes learning seamless and part of their daily living! It has made memorizing the planets, their order, and other fun facts very easy. While it's not ""perfect,"" (who can keep up with Pluto's changing status anyway? ;), it offers plenty of valuable information for elementary aged kids like mine. The placemat seems as well made as could be for a plastic placemat and I expect to hold up for a long time."
4,Education and good graphics. Dry erase markers don't erase well though.,"My son enjoys eating off of this place mat. The only negative is that even using a dry erase market, it was not very easy to take off the markings on the back side that recommends using a dry erase marker."
5,Darling Book!,As a long time fan of Rosemary Wells books for my children I now have one for myself and I love it.
3,Grassy,I am trying to find a replacement for L'Occitane's Cedre cologne which is no longer made. This isn't it. It's pleasant enough but to me the top notes are grassy rather than balsam or cedar.The scent does last for a long time. It's just not what I had in mind. The search continues...
5,GREAT LIVE CD,"This live CD is very good, but it does have some letdowns. They should have taken off all of the Ice Cube tracks and replaced them with Rammstein tracks. Too bad KoRn's ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" and Limp Bizkit's ""Counterfeit"" are on the video, and not the CD. The CD does have the medly of 6 of KoRn's best, plus ""Freak On A Leash"", ""Twist/Chi"", and ""Got The Life"". It also has Limp Bizkit's ""Faith"", Rammstein's ""Du Hast"", Orgy's ""Blue Monday"", and Incubus' ""New Skin"". Every performance on this CD is high quality. The video is also worth getting. A fan of any of these groups should get this."
2,Too Chopped Up Too Short!,"This cd has some great artists on it. It has some GREAT songs on it, but it is too chopped up. It's too short. You can tell over half the concert was edited out. If they could not at least do about 80% of the concert (at least more of the Korn show) then why bother?"
2,It could have been better,"The only good songs on this CD are Blue Monday, Du Hast, Got The Life, and Freak on a Leash. The rest of the CD is horrible. There should have been more Rammstein and Korn."
3,IT WAS AWSOME BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,IT WAS AWSOME BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT SOUNDED LIKE THE REAL CDs IT SOUNDS REALY WEIRD
5,teens review,"i thought that this cd is great if you have the cash get it asap but this cd has great songs by orgy,limp bizkit,ice cube rammstien,and of course korn its great get it."
4,"Not Bad, Not Bad at all","I'll give a review of each section of the CD. First, the interludes and intro, get two stars. They're stupid and studio-made. Incubus, 5 stars, they're great on here. Orgy, 4 stars, I like them a little, and they're better live, I think. Limp Bizkit get 2 stars. I love Limp Bizkit, but they suck on this CD. Ice Cube, 4 stars, he's not my thing, but he's really good at what he does. Rammstien, 2 stars, their music is boring when the singer comes in. KoRn, 6 stars, they rock, as always. All this averages to about four stars."
5,korn orgy and limp bizik in the same place at the same time!,"I love this tour, I love this cd, I love the video All the bands rocked, all the surprises (korn and Ice cube do'in wicked)and the infamous Rammstien incedent. All and all Korn is da bomb (so is Limp bizik, Rammstien, Orgy, and the rest)"
3,If you like Mainstream Songs then Buy this CD,"But if you are not one of these MTV fans then this CD isn't very good. KoRn did put more of there old stuff then I expected but I would have prefered individual songs instead of the Shot Liver Medley which was basically 5 songs squished into one track... Not a big fan of Orgy but the songs picked for the CD where the most mainstream of there's...Rammstein unfortunately only had Du Hast (again there most mainstream song)...Incubus had New Skin (do u see a trend of mainstream going on)... Ice Cube had all his hits...Limp Bizkit had all his hits with the exception of a new track entitled Cambodia which personally turned out to be my favorite track on the cd... Mainstream fans will love this cd but true fans I recommend you stay away from this cd. I'm always open to discussion, Email me."
4,Orgy blows the comp. away!,"And that's very true. Orgy had the best set here. KoRn was decent, Rammstein should have had more tracks as should have Incubus, but it was nice to see Bizkit drop some nice tracks not included on their albums like 'Cambodia' and 'Jump Around'. Ice Cube, no matter what you think, held his own here and is serves us a worthy track selection. Too bad 'Family Values' don't come around no more but with Limp sucking now a dayz it would be pointless. Still, this is a solid album with great live performances...could have been better but then again, it's very rare you hit something perfect."
3,It's nice,"Dude, at first it's the best cd in the world, the it turns into not so cool after you get tired of the liveness of it. But it's nice."
1,JUST ONE RAMMSTEIN TRACK??!,"Thats so unfair, Rammstein can kick anyones ass...Orgys live show sucks, Korn and Limp Bizkit is all RAP...none of the bands on the family values tour were ROCK bands except Rammstein, but of course...the youth of America is too ignorant to accept Rammstein because the don't sing in english to ""accomodate"" the American fans. Just one Rammstein song? Then I give it just one star."
1,Terrible,"As a broad minded parent, I let my 12 year old son buy the CD. After we both listened to it - we agreed it has no musical validity. The CD stinks and is going to be traded in."
4,"family values '99= no rap, more rock!","Family Values '98 ruled! needed more Ramms+ein on the CD though, but it's all good. There should be NO RAP on the next one! what the hell possessed KoRn & LB the put rappers on their tour! what the hell! this is a friggin' rock concert, NOT soul train!If i wanted rap i would be watching BET right now, but i ain't.....hope someone feels my pain! peace. later! :-)"
2,"I don't own this, but where is the rammstein?","I see that Rammstein peformed on this tour, but where are the songs by them? OK, so they have Du Hast, but common, they have like 20 great songs! Korn and Bizkit suck, let us all understand that who aren't 12 year olds. Orgy and Rammstein need more tracks on this album! What is wrong with the people that made this???"
4,It was very good,I thought it was a very good cd and a good mixture. 'Freak On A Leash' didnt sound as good as it did on the CD. But 'Got The Life' was great. Rammstein was also terrific but they only had one song on the CD. Of course it was 'Du Hast'. Otherwise it was awesome!
1,Where's the Ramms+ein?,"I was unfortunate not to go to the concet, but I bought the video (which by the way is better),and as soon as I heard the C.D. I was so disappointed with it. It !_NEEDS_MORE_RAMMSEIN_! though!By the way, Rappers such as DMX (or any rappers) !_DO NOT_! need to be on the Family Values `99 Tour this year Damn it!"
4,Awesome CD,I think that this CD was very good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because there are so many young fans of the bands on this CD but they cannot buy it because of Parental Warnings. If they were to make some clean versions of their CD's than I would know that sales would increase a lot...
5,Family Values ROCKS!,"The Family Values Your '98 CD definetely is the BEST CD ever!! If yoou're a Orgy, Limp Bizkit, and KoRn fan then you will love this CD!!! Its got 5 diffrent artists on it, and they all ROCK!!!!! You have to buy this CD!!!! You'd be stupid not to!!!"
5,Great as every one of his books!!,"I had read all of mr. Chaim Walder's books in hebrew, and they are just beutifuly written!I recommend readin this book, it is very touching, and can teach every one of us a small lesson, here or there.Shana Tova!"
5,Smooth 70's soul,"""Feel the need in me"" is the type of song you hear once and feel like you have known it for years. I bought this CD for that track. The version from 1977 is a great disco classic that is not on any collection. The rest of the CD is smooth 70's soul and a great listen. Although I didn't know these songs prior to my purchase, they are virtually all catchy and I am glad I bought it."
3,Flawed,"I purchased the Riedel Magnum Decanter on Amazon.com, ""Sold by Witbecks and Fulfilled by Amazon"" and it just arrived. Upon opening the box it was impressive looking, which is what I wanted, but I was a bit surprised how little protective packaging there was so I looked at it closely for damage. No damage but I did find two visible imperfections that look like bubbles on the surface. They are substantial enough that they cause a scratching noise when you run your fingernail across them. Very disappointing. Not sure if I'm going to go through the hassle of returning it or just be disappointed every time I use it."
3,I used the Good News disposable razor on ...,"I used the Good News disposable razor on my legs and was pleased with the smooth, close shave. I usually use a single blade disposable and the double blade of the Good News gives a smoother shave. I think the price of these razors is rather high for a disposable -- and they don't last for as many shaves as the single edge. Overall, I was pleased and will probably buy them again if they're on sale, but they probably won't replace my regular disposable."
4,This is a very good disposable razor. I've ...,"This is a very good disposable razor. I've been using another brand, but this one seems to shave much cleaner and with less nicks (actually no nicks). I would definitely recommend this razor to others, and I did give a couple to my son who really liked them too. He usually uses an electric razor, but said that he'd use these for really close shaves. I'll definitely be using this razor instead of the one I used before the Test Drive."
4,"I found the razors worked well, but as ...","I found the razors worked well, but as I have sensitive skin they were a bit rough. I did research and found they also make a razor with an added aloe strip so you may want to go with that product. They worked as long as other disposables and were very easy to grip -- not those smooth handles that some razors have that slip from your hands when you're in the shower. Overall, I'd recommend them."
3,Overall I'll have to say this is a ...,Overall I'll have to say this is a pretty good disposable razor. It provided a clean smooth shave. The only negative thing I found was the color -- yellow. A good alternative to some of those pricey permanent razors.
3,Where is Clifford,I enjoyed reading this book it was fun to look under the flaps. Where is Clifford was a great book for people to read. The author of this book was Norman Bridwell. He did a good job writing this book by making the children guess if Clifford was under the flap on each page or not. There really wasn't much too it because on every page it just asked a question if and then you lift up the flap and look to see if Clifford is there or not. I recommend this book to children 12 and under. Over all this book took me about three minutes to read and was easy for my project
4,what can I say...,"..this disc makes me cry. Their is just a presence in her voice that shakes my soul. There is a science in her spiritual output that subtly places all my demons to rest. From the opening track to the end of the disc I find myself relaxed and contented, but filled with a joyfilled teary-eyed wonder.My only real hang up about the disc are the poppier edges.. although I know most people will find them delicious, as I usually would as well, I personally find them unnecessary in her work. All in all though... Yungchen Lhamo is great at what she crafts. And i thank her for this disc."
2,undecided about this CD.,"Some CD's will sit in my player and initially get listened to a lot. Then periodically get revisited. This one got played once and then I moved on to something else. This may have been because I was not in the mood for this music at that time because I certainly didn't dislike it, but I have not felt the urge to put it back on the CD player again. I will give it a better listen at some stage and may have to amend this review, but I think that it will wind up sitting in the CD rack gathering dust."
1,BEWARE - Wrecked my PDA.,"Did a nice job of protecting the screen from scratches, but when I removed it, the screen started acting strange. The pen movement became very imprecise, jumpy. Had to send it in for service. Peeling it off puts a lot of upward pressure on the screen, and it wrecked mine. Don't chance it. Spend your money on a better stylus and skip the WriteWrong."
5,Great Quality,Gates makes a good product and i have used them in the past. When i entered the vehicle it said that it didn't fit so i went on the gates site and ordered the hoses and they do fit my vehicle. The gates hoses are high quality at a cheaper price so if i can save a few dollars it's worth the time.
2,Not complete in its areas listed,"If you are looking for a overview of the Maltese, this book will work. But if you are needing breeding, grooming, etc. questions answered, look for another more complete Maltese book."
5,Cinematic Genius,"When Eraserhead was released on VHS many years ago, I ran out and got a copy post-haste. Having been the only person in my circle that had seen Eraserhead in the theatre prior to video release, I gathered all my friends for a ""video night"". Beer and popcorn and David Lynch.Needless to say, one of my friends became physically ill halfway through our viewing, and blamed it squarely on the film.The images and sounds were more than he could stomach, literally.This same friend also became violently ill during a live performance by the Mahavishnu Orchestra.Coincidence? I'm afraid so.Some people cannot handle genius when it is put before them in explicit form.Check it out for yourself!"
2,uhhhhhh,"I guess my problem with this movie comes from the fact I am a massive David Lynch fan. I didnt enjoy this, in fact it put me to sleep and then inspired miserable dreams.This is for the fans only, fans of what exactly, I am not sure. If you want to see a good, wierd David Lynch movie, watch Blue Velvet. Otherwise I am not sure exactly what drug you need to take to enjoy this flick!"
5,I keep coming back after 30+ years...,"The closest thing to describing Eraserhead is to say it's a film transcription of a very odd dream...Visually stunning, always surreal. Not sure what the message is (if any) but I'm drawn back to this puppy after I saw it in a theater 30+ years ago..."
2,like a torture for the very first time ...,"come on, you 5-star-reviewers, remain on the carpet, as we say in germany ... this is not a masterpiece, but maybe a good joke of david l. watching this film is (to me) like going to the dentist for 2 hours or like having to eat huge portions of snot with vomitus at the restaurant.there seem to be people who enjoy this kind of activities ... please, feel free and do not be offended.when i saw it in the theater, most members of the audience where pale young people wearing dark clothes. i asked one (beautiful) young black dressed lady sitting next to me, how she liked the movie ... she simply answered: 'wonderful ...'."
1,Distilled Ugliness: Avoid,"I unfortunately saw this film with two younger friends in about 1980 in a small theater in Eugene, Oregon. We hoped to better understand our culture through cinema and to critique the worldview of the film. It was a mistake, although well-meaning.The film is, as another friend of mine at the time said, nothing but ""distilled ugliness."" There is no point to it, except perhaps to inject nihilism into the soul. Many scenes are outright hideous (I would never describe them to anyone) and the overall effect is oppressive, dark, and despairing. Having a a meal afterward with my young colleagues, we sensed this heaviness and had to pray to break the spell.Yes, some will say we missed all the artistic nuance, and so on. No, we were repelled by the repellent. If you want a creative encounter with the possibility of meaninglessness, then consider an early Igmar Bergman film, but not this."
1,Please Erase this from my memory...,"I thought I would sit back and enjoy a cult classic,as everyone claims this movie is, one Saturday afternoon. Instead I was punished with this worthless movie. The lead Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) does a wonderful job of playing a nervous misfit. Other than him the other actors/actress's are awful and/or over the top. If Lynch's goal was to make the viewer feel sick,bored and numb then he passed with flying colors."
2,"There is a fine line between ""Genius"" and Insanity.","There is a fine line between ""Genius"" and Insanity. So if your DVD collection only contains movies from The Sundance Festival you'll love it!, otherwise dont waste your money."
3,"Ok, but the white noise generator is a bit overused.",Some weird guy and his weirder girlfriend have a deformed baby. (I knew a group of mexican guys who said they saw it tripping and were laughing so hard that the movie was stopped and they were thrown out of the theater.)
2,"What? Help, my head just popped!","I am confused, I don't know what is going on. Who is the guy by the window pushing the levers? and what about all those sperm things including the BABY?!?!?!?!?. Who is the girl behind the radiator? did I say BEHIND THE RADIATOR? what is going on? what am I saying? Help, my head just popped, I think i am insane, HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A TALE OF TWO DIRECTORS,"SO THIS IS DAVID LYNCH'S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT.MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS NOW I HAVE A NEW MOVIETO PUT ON MY LIST OF THE TEN WORST EVER MADE.IT IS COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL, VIRTUALLY UNWATCHABLE.IT IS GROSS AND VULGAR, WITH NO REDEEMING VALUE.IF THERE IS A MESSAGE, IT IS LOST AMONGST THEMOST VILE SCREEN IMAGES I HAVE EVER SEEN.COMPARE THIS ABOMINATION TO THE DIRECTORIALDEBUT OF DARREN ARONOFSKY. HIS FIRST MOVIE, PI,PUTS LYNCH TO SHAME.IT IS INVENTIVE, MEMORABLE, WITH IMAGES AND MESSAGES,THAT SPEAK OF THE INHERENT TALENT OF THE DIRECTORAND PORTENDS THE GOOD THINGS TO COME.CAN YOU THEN COMPARE THE TWO DIRECTORS?YES. ONE IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS A MAJOR NEW TALENTWHO MUST BE RECKONED WITH IN THE FUTURE.THE OTHER IS A DIRECTOR WHOSE TRUE COLORS WEREREADILY APPARENT IN HIS FIRST MOVIE.(NO PUN INTENDED)DR SCOTT"
1,pencilneck,"A mess. Don't waste your time. Two of the most overrated film directors of all time are Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch--oh yeah, Hitchcock is another one.Jack Nance did a nice turn in Bukowski's Barfly, though. Check it out."
3,watched,"Ithink the surreal filming of Eraserhead made it all to real, it is horrifying to watch,even if you dont understand what is going on immediatly you cant stop watching . It seriously sets you thinking about the state of mind that creates such a film,one being was he an observer or the other had he experienced such a state of being tographicly get the message over so well.its a film about industrys greed and socioty suffocation,supressing the human values of life.i think everyone should see it once just so u can spot the eraserheads today,and have some understanding of how and whythey end up being as they are. watched it once would not watch it again."
4,An Amazing Art Film,"ERASERHEAD is certainly not for everybody. But for those who appreciate art films as much (or more than) mainstream narrative films, ERASERHEAD may be as close to perfection as an art film can get.The very simple plot of the movie takes backseat to ERASERHEAD's atmosphere. Through brilliant sound design, fantastic black and white photography, and the strangest of subjects on which to focus his camera, Lynch has created a fascinating, unnerving tone in this movie. It is certainly not reality - it is, in fact, quite nightmarish - but Lynch masterfully lets this movie get just close enough to reality to make the nightmare atmosphere extremely chilling. This film sticks with you, haunting your mind for days after you view ERASERHEAD.The DVD comes with an odd but fascinating documentary on the (years long) production of ERASERHEAD. It is one of the most interesting tales of a movie getting made I've ever heard. Highly recommended... Check it out!"
3,Eraserhead(1977),"Boy, this is going to be fun. Eraserhead(1977) is a black and white film about a man who is unprepared to be a husband and a father. David Lynch tells the story in a weird, surreal, crazy format. This makes Twin Peaks(1992) look ""normal"". We used to have an Eraserhead magnet stuck to our icebox. Eraserhead is very avante-garde. It does not feel like a conventional Hollywood movie. Eraserhead may have been referenced in El Mariachi(1992). I can't tell you guys what to think of Eraserhead. Watch it and come up with your own opinion."
5,"A fascinating and hypnotic journey through image, sounds, and sights.","Atmospheric. Industrial. Grating sounds. Silence. Steamy sounds. Smoke. Silence. Groaning machines. Solitude. Parenthood. Creaking doors. Loneliness. Silence. Abrupt slams. Bizarre interludes. Hideous offspring. Spazzy girlfriend. Erotic neighbor. Little hen dinner. The lady in the radiator. Pencil erasers.If you like the art of film, you will most likely need to see Eraserhead at least once. I needed to see it more than once..."
1,Can't believe i watched the whole thing,"While I guess this may be considered visual art. Don't watch this if you're a fan of story, plot, or good movies."
1,It does hold a record of sorts,"This movie holds an esteemed place in my family's memory. It is known as the worst movie we have ever seen. We saw it probably around 1981 or so and nothing has beat it since. Nothing happens - we don't belong to the culture that believes dark nothingness is meaningful. It is boring, unrelieved nothingness. Occasionally we recommend it to enemies. We want them to wonder what WE know that no one else does. The answer, nothing. We are not pretentious idiots. Really."
1,Absurd!,"I had to force myself to finish this movie. I watch a movie for a story and to be entertained. Period. I'm not a film critic or a psychologist. While I watched this movie I figured that somewhere along the line, something had to make sense. It didn't. Besides, just because a movie is obscure, strange, whatever, doesn't make it deep!I watched it on Netflicks (instant on Roku), so at least I didn't waste money on it. Actually, I've had more interesting nightmares!! Humm.......maybe I should make a movie.And, I've never seen so many, ""open-minded"",""deep-thinking"" adults(?) incapable of accepting difference of opinion. Grow up guys, its just a movie.A 1977 review of Eraserhead by Variety called it a ""sickening bad-taste exercise"" which ""pulls out all gory stops in the unwatchable climax....the mind boggles to learn that Lynch labored on this pic for five years"
1,Pointless and insanely stupid,"It really amused me to read all the positive reviews of this pointless movie. It is absolute drivel. Film can be used in alot of ways, it's kind of sad that some people choose to waste their lives on this depressing garbage."
1,Review of Eraserhead,"This was the strangest movie I have ever seen. Truly a demented mind to have created it. I understand it may not be possible to know exactly what it was about, but What I found it to mean seemed rather misogynistic. It was also hard to say what exactly it was, but I found it was something I wish I had not watched for a reason beyond being a bad movie."
5,the long awaited release of Eraserhead on DVD,"I just purchased the new DVD release of Eraserhead from the David Lynch website and I am happy to report that it is superb!!!The extras include a story as told by David Lynch himself about the making of the film. Priceless!!! The quality is as I have reported!!! Yes I know that the film is dark, disturbing and like a dream that you would not like to have but as a cinematic work of ART it is excellent!!! It is a collectable for the collector. I am severely pleased that this ""new"" DVD release was very well done. I hope that it is released soon to the general public so that they might experience Eraserhead in a format that is ""as good as it gets!"". Thank You David Lynch for a job well done!"
3,Odd,For the artsy crowd. Can appreciate it but I wouldn't say it was entertaining though it was funny in spots. One thing I will say is I felt a little cold at the end. Must have been that howling wind throughout the movie.
1,"Loved the movie, hated the service...","I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for a true fan and she LOVED it! HOWEVER, I bought it from Barnes and Noble. I ordered it from Amazon twice, and got the wrong thing twice. I received the cheaper, ""international"" version both times. When returning the second one the very nice service rep assured me they would pull this from the site and get to the bottom of the confusion. As far as I could see, this never happened. They also issued me a $15. Credit for future purchases. My biggest beef is that when I received the e-mail notifications for my credits on both items, the reason for the credit was stated as ""delivered late"". Ever wonder why Amazon is consistently tops in customer service? They just spin negative feedback into something not so bad. Whew, thanks for the rant."
4,Beautiful film about post-colonial New England,"Life in quaint in New England. America has gained its independence and things are going great. Ralph and Tammy love each other but have some serious fears about marriage. They are young and want to make the right choice. However, it seems that they weren't too nervous about the marital act when Tammy shows to be pregnant. People talk in New England, a lot, and now it looks like Tammie's life is ruined. The couple get married immediately but people still know about their pre-marital baby. To make matters worse an old flame of Tammie's is threatening to claim the baby is his unless they pay off his mortgage. What will become of their reputation? Watch and enjoy- Eraserhead."
3,Lynch's eraserhead,"This brave film is an investigation into new languages (poetic, surrealistic, expressionist) applied to the cinema medium."
1,BIZARRE BEYOND BELIEF...,"... if nothing else, you've got to see it at least once just to experience it... my personal opinion is that you'll probably connect with ERASERHEAD (and with most Lynch productions) if you're the type who tends to walk on the wild side, intellectually speaking. Otherwise, you'll not likely find any redeeming value in it whatsoever unless you're a film student or possess slightly warped tastes."
3,Totally Bizarre Film,"I have heard about this film ever since I was a small child. Finally, I got a chance to watch it today. Really bizarre film and dark film. Many of the images in the film were disgusting and disturbing. The sound effects were pretty intense as well. Its a truly jarring experience to watch this film. I cannot say that I genuinely enjoyed watching this film but I am glad that I finally saw it after being so curious for so long. Its a truly one of a kind film but I don't think I will watch it again."
5,Erasehead....You can't un-erase what you've seen!,David Lynch's first movie and his best! He's at his mind-bending and disturbing best! This is the movie that set the precedent for the rest of his future projects!
2,SO OS,i did watch this. i did watch this. i saw it as a time line running backward to the beggining of the end. try gaining that for the big bang.
4,one of the most disturbing movies ever made,"I love David Lynch's films, and consider him a talented and brilliant artist. That said, I haven't been able to watch this movie since I first saw it sometime in the 1980's. I am going to have to watch it again at some point to see how it strikes me now that 30 years have gone by, but my impression then was that it is a masterfully nauseating descent into a Freudian dream-hell exploring (among other things) the male fear of paternity. I'm a woman, and a mother, and this movie, if I interpreted anything about it correctly, gave me the rawest, most honest insight into it might mean to some men to contemplate becoming a father...and it resonated with me. Tell me how many men can plumb their subconscious like that and translate it into visual imagery? It's a masterpiece, without a doubt. It's also about the farthest thing from a feel-good movie you'd ever wish to see."
5,This version is defective,"If you want this movie, purchase the 2000 version. This one is glitchy and everytime a character moves or walks, the film jumps a little bit. It almost looks like its part of the film and if you hadn't seen the film before, you wouldn't even notice. But I did. Get the 2000 version which has cooler special features and a funny menu selection - they loop the dead-cat scene over and over. I'm going to try and get my money back on this version. But Eraserhead is such a great visionary film. Bizarre and grotesque, yet visionary."
1,extremely disturbing,"I suppose one is supposed to find something artful to say about an art film; I can't say anything but to plainly advise everyone to avoid it-unless you take some perverse pleasure in having profoundly disturbing imagery injected into your brain without local anesthesia.The Movie ""Brazil"" was also disturbing, but at least the cinemetography was a rich visual tapestry. What can one say about a nightmarish film noir which vividly portrays one's most nauseating, nerve fraying fears in relentless stabbing strokes of black and white? This is what the truly ""lost"" would find amusing and stimulating....""lost"" meaning all those wretched souls who will one day descend, permanently, into a reality much like this one. If it was supposed to save us from moral and cultural decline, it failed miserably. Life is too short , brutish and nasty to spend one's time wallowing in the interminably brutish and nasty. Move on...don't waste your time. A mind is too precious a commodity to putrify."
1,don't buy the hype,"this is probably the worst movie ever made...if you are at a poker game and you don't know who the sucker is, it's you. this is how you feel after walking out of this movie (or viewing it in the comfort of your home.) save your time and money, or better yet go for a nice walk in the country."
1,Awful,"I appreciate avant-garde cinema as much as anyone, but this film is revolting. Other than shock value, it has no redeeming qualities."
1,"Bad, painful, bad, boring... oh, and bad.","The ratings don't go down to zero. Pity.This movie is just not fun. Some movies are humorous in their badness. Here, you don't even get that. Avoid it."
3,Very Different,"I am all for strange, underground, cult films, however, this was not one of my favorites. I feel as though nothing happened the whole time I watched it. I probably would never watch this film again, although it was quite humorous in certain points. I suppose you could check it out, but just letting you know, it was nothing that I expected...Want to see a movie that's more stange....get 'Gummo' by Harmony Korine."
4,Eraserhead,You have to make your own inturpritation of this film.I'm sure no two views will be alike. Steven Wright could probably come up with the best review of all.....
5,Welcome to my Nightmare,"I saw this picture in my early 20's and it changed the way I watch movies. This one crept up on me three days after I saw it and has rattled around in the back of my psyche ever since. It's the surreal dreamlike quality of Lynch's vison that is the most disturbing. I have yet to find another motion picture that captures this element so eloquently. It's as if this man got inside of Dali's head and made a motion picture out of his grey matter.There is always something acrid, hot, moist, dirty and fuzzy in that corner in the basement. Don't look there, it's too horrible for words.Where's the DVD?"
5,Wonderful nightmare!,"I don't know why this movie is so impossible to track down... It is a surrealist masterpiece! Things like this shouldn't be so hard to get ahold of!Maybe Amazon will start carrying the Korean version sometime. If you're looking for Eraserhead, I'd recommend checking Ebay for the aforementioned Korean version. Most are formatted for all regions, and the Korean subtitles are removeable anyways. It's a bit of work to track it down, but definetly worth it."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:It may be just about the cultiest cult movie this side of Rocky Horror, but Eraserhead is a suffocatingly obtuse movie that gets lots of points for creepiness and special effects but none for coherency, characters, or anything that makes a movie actually fun to sit through: you have to have a special sort of taste to appreciate this film, and I clearly don't have it."
4,Looking for a movie that will make you shake your head?,"I purchase this movie for my daughter at Christmas as we sat watching we just kept asking ourselves, where is this going? In reality David Lynch takes us on this wild look into a very strange person's life. The dinner scene at the girlfriend's house epitomizes all of the bad dinners you have ever had at someones house. It is bizarre, brilliant and surreal. For that matter the whole movie is surreal. Shot as a low budget film, it makes you uncomfortable, you want to help these people, you want to yell at them to stop, you want to tell them to get a life! Lynch really sets in motion a whole series of events that keep you shaking your head until the very end. This is a movie worth owning."
5,Worth every penny!,"It's been a while since I've had a chance to sit down a watch this film. If you find you have no sense of humor watching the strange and unusual-""Don't watch this"". I love Lynch!!I love all the strange and unusual characters-theme-plot-subtext-begining-middle and end. My favorite character still has to be the kid who looks like a crying loaf of french bread.Don't try to figure out anything about this movie. Just sit back and enjoy!"
3,Wierd movie night,If you like surreal movies (and I mean really strange) you might want to watch this one. It is thought provoking and disturbing. Easily the strangest movie I have seen.
5,Number 249,"This is the 249th review of Eraserhead. The word ""surreal"" is used often and inappropriately. Eraserhead is a work of surrealism, plain and simple. It took me ten years to watch it all the way through to the end. Now I talk about it every chance I get."
2,What the hell......?,"I guess I can honestly say, with confidence, that this is the weirdest, most pointless film, I have ever seen. If Kubrick liked it, it only makes it more clear why Kubrick himself can go off into some strange unexplained tangent in some of the films he does.I enjoy watching obscure films, but this one showed no sense of direction. I can't see how anyone would want to watch this one twice, or more.There is such a non sense of direction with this film that they didn't even bother to break it down to separate chapters. What a depressing film.I was bored out of my mind! I'd rather watch an Osmond Family TV Comedy Hour than to watch this pointless film again."
1,HORRIBLY BAD,I AM sorry but I HATED every bit of Eraserhead. Art does not have to be enjoyable but GOOD art does. This move has NO redeeming value whatsoever. It's like overdosing on BAD ACID with a horrible Red wine hangover. Well wait I guess THAT is valuable see Eraserhead and you don't have to overdose on BAD acid after a night binge drinking cheep sangria.PS. I forgot the elves with ice picks.PPS. I DID like Blue Velvet though.
5,A cult classic.,"Eraserhead is the most disturbing, warped, and surreal films possibly ever made. The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i.e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder ""Is that thing real?"" The baby is so hideous, it's slight off pitch cry is the only thing that is even remotely human about it.Would I recommend this movie? It depends. To most, I would strongy encourage them NOT to watch, it's too bizarre, it's too weird. But then, to some who can take it, I would highly recommend it. In terms of bizarreness, Pi is the only other movie that even comes close, but even that looks like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood in comparison to Eraserhead."
4,Young songbird who sound very stylish and classy!,"Although young Dame Cleo didn't posses that famous multi-octave voice (that comes later), on this early recordings she sounds wonderfully warm and stylish.This album actually makes neccesariy listening for any Cleo Laine fan, since represents her early work from 50-ies (other albums are ""The British sessions"" and ""The very best of"" which shows her growth through decades). Unfortunatelly this recordings are not really the earliest (""Mister and Missisipi"" from 1952. well that is something to hear!) but anyway young Cleo was charmingly full of enthusiasm and decidedly kept her british accent all the way.Songs are very well-known and very wisely chosen as the matter of the fact (maybe not commercial-wise, but they definitely stand the test of time) and particulary in the last song ""Sugar""- sung by Cleo's idol Peggy Lee in original - young Cleo sing like a dream.Very beautiful!"
4,"Two wonderful soloists, ill yoked","Molloy is (IMHO) the world's best traditional flautist, while Keane is a magnificent virtuoso fiddler. But I find this album almost painful to listen to. Keane's approach to a tune is to sidle up to it, whisper sweet nothings in its ear, and seduce it; Molloy walks straight up to it, looks it in the eye, and says ""Let's do it."" This discrepancy isn't apparent when both men are playing with the Chieftains because everyone's individual style is rather lost in the shuffle (or they're playing solos and free to do their own thing). But on this album Keane is trying to suppress his natural discursiveness and follow Molloy's straight-ahead approach to the tunes, and it just doesn't work. It's still a good album because both men are wonderful musicians, but they don't mesh well (Molloy's album with Tommy Peoples, who shares his musical approach, is a horse of quite another color)."
4,That was a pretty good rehearsal. Now let's take that one and do it with a little more religious fervor.,"This is a tribute album to Robert Altman's classic film,Nashville. Unlike most tribute albums, there are no performances by anyone you ever heard of on this one. On this one, a Canadian woman got some of her friends together and recorded the songs from her favorite movie. Surprisingly, it's actually quite good. All the singer can carry a tune, and they are backed up by professional musicians. The CD includes all the songs from the film (including some that were left off of the soundtrack album), plus some bits of dialogue from the movie. I found it to be quite entertaining, although some people may be annoyed that they stayed SO faithful to the songs' original arrangements."
1,What were they thinking?????,"Yeah, I love Nashville. One of my favorite movies. And the soundtrack is a personal favorite. What's more, I love singing along as it plays. However, it would never occur to me to record my own singing of these great songs, and it is unfortunate that the people responsible for this didn't exercise the same common sense. This CD is truly wretched.Do yourself a favor. Watch the movie. Repeatedly. Buy and listen to the soundtrack. But avoid this mess at all costs."
1,Sorry all involved this could have been made by K-Tel,"Back in the 70's a great movie was made by Robert Altman and a fantastic cast of actors. The songs for the most part were written by the performers themselves much in the country music tradition. Creating and playing character in this movie meant more than memorizing lines (there are tons of ad lib lines in the movie) but inventing a performer and his or her music catalogue as well. Now for this well meaning tribute album. These artist are certainly talented in their own right but why, why, why did they feel mimicking the original soundtrack artists would some how make this a CD worth buying? It must have been a blast to record this CD unfortunately it's a not so fun to listen to. Imagine a 21st century interpretation of this unusual Hollywood does country musical score. Even if this approach failed it would have earned some respect for the attempt instead of loving yet misguided tribute."
5,One of my best reads in a long while!!!,I thought this book was great! I highly recommend it. The story's twists and turns were intriguing and certainly kept my interest. I couldn't wait to read the ending. I will pursue this author in the hopes of finding another like this!
4,Very Good!,"This was a hard one to put down. Gunn was so easy to hate! Although a little farfetched, I think this book appeals to the ""get even"" side of all of us! It moved along very quickly and was a fun read. A good one for a long summer afternoon."
2,Tedious rather than terrifying.,"The book jacket announces: ""You hold in your hands a slightly twisted and wholly terrifying thriller destined to become a classic. Nothing here is what is seems."" I found it to be very twisted and mildly challenging and wondered where the classic idea came from. It is not particulary well-crafted or even plotted. It certainly is not a classic of anything and it is not terrifying - just tedious."
1,Terrible,Typical story. Evil suburban man Good suburban woman. Every cliche of horror was used in this book.This book is not worth reading.
2,The Caretaker,The author knows very little about the business world and it shows in his writing. Reading the book is like watching a mediocre movie of the week on network television.
2,"Boring Plot, Boring Characters","The first 200 pages I was tempted to just take it back to the library, but I stuck it out to the bitter end probably hoping that it would improve. This tedious book did not improve and the characters really got on my nerves after awhile. I would not feel inclined to ever read anything again by this author."
3,"Good Story, BAD Ending. Could have been better!!!","This book was good, though hardly exceptional. The plot was pretty predictable, in that I guessed what was happening before half the book was read. I only kept reading to see the culmination of events, and was very disappointed by the ending. Readers who like an entertaining story will be enjoy this book, but those who look for a powerful climax will find this book lacking."
4,"Great ! Like all of Simpson's books, I wished it didn't end!","I've read all of Simpson's novels, and next to ""The Gypsy Storyteller"", this was my favorite! I didn't want to put it down and had to force myself to go to sleep. I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes a good page-turner!!"
3,Good read; moves fast and has a unique plot.,Interesting plot with a story that moves with good speed. Characters are slowly fleshed out which holds the reader to the building suspense.
5,Provocative pose which is true to the video game character,Rachel character has a very provocative unrealistic anime battle maiden type look throughout the Ninja Gaiden game and this figurine is no different. She is a demon slayer in the game with a giant war hammer and she has her favored weapon as part of this figurine/pose. This figurine made me realise details I hadn't even noticed in the game like the extra small sword she carries around but never uses. Excellent attention to detail. Very true to the video game character.
3,Good musianship...moderately entertaining...,"This compilation is a promo album for some talented jazz artiststhat play and endorse YAMAHA musical instruments. There is a mix of standards and original comps. Ensembles performing range from duos to big band/orchestra settings and everything inbetween. Good variety, all featuring a soloist. Thematically this is not a mainstream album. It will not disturb you during conversation, reading, or hosting a cocktail hour. The 24Bit mastering will assure you of cyrstal clear sound highlighting the YAMAHA instruments. There are photos and biographies on all the artists. If you can get this cheap, buy it!"
3,Not really a better idea....,"As many people have said, the book gives measurements for several sizes of quilts and while that is very helpful, it gets tiring having to go back to the pages to see which size piece you need. After giving you this information and allowing you to precut all of your pieces, she really ought to refer to the sizes of the piece in the instructions, ie: Using the 2 1/2"" Star Point strips... do this.... I found it distracting to have to go back to those pages and hunt for the description of the piece I needed. Also... the corners on one quilt don't work out as well as you would believe from the instructions in the book, I spent about two hours trying in vain to get nice flat seems from a point that had eight pieces of fabric joining together."
5,Favorit Stripper,Eleanor Burns can teach anyone to sew a quilt. Her instructions are so clear. I bought this for my grand daughter.
4,Eleanor Still Has it!,"Well, if you have ever watch ""Quilt In A Day"" on PBS with Elenor Burns you will find this a fun and enjoyable book. Lots of beautiful patterns and quilts. Sprinkled among her family photo album of where the last 25 years have taken Elenor. It is witty (as she is) and funny and the quilts are very pretty and I think simple to make!A must buy for any quilter who loves Elenor Burns!Happy Day!Wendywww.hearttohandonline.com"
5,So easy to follow.,"Eleanor Burns is wonderful. Her books are so easy to follow, the directions are easy for beginners, but not too simplified for experts."
5,A Rich Read,"I was surprised by this man's great literary span. I had never heard of him before, but was given a copy of his short stories by a friend. I couldn't put it down, absolutely fabulous. There is in his writing a kind of surreal reality, if that's not too contradictory, which kind of grabs you and brings you up sharp.Two stories which for me stood out were the enigmatic 'Walking Through A Snowstorm...' and 'Blue Vanishing Monday'. Incredible stuff. I liked his freshness, his newness his differentness. I would like to read more, I think I really have a taste for the guy's work. A really rich and honest read.Kenneth"
4,"beautifully written, touching book","Margaret Mahy's charaters think in unusual and compelling ways. Johnny, Bonny, and Sophie are no exceptions. This is a beautiful book that will touch anyone who has ever been haunted by her or his past."
1,"My daughter Molly's review follows: ""It stinks.""","The text of Molly's (she is 13) review follows: ""I don't know why the boy was always drunk. It really bothered me that he drank constantly.How could Sophie survive on moldy crackers and rotten milk for two years? I think that would kill her.."""
4,Worthy effort from these Detroit Natives,"I first got a listen to Frank N Dank on the immortal J-Dilla's classic Welcome 2 Detroit. When I heard they were dropping their own album, I had to go cop it. The beats definitely add to the music instead of subtracting from it, FND is adept and in control of their music, which shows with the rythm and pin point precise hooks on most of their songs. You can tell FND slept in the lab to perfect their craft. 3 tracks from Dilla are fantasic, as well as nice production from Kardinal Offishall, Saukrates, Ohno, and others. Just like other Detroit-made albums, you can sit back, burn one, and vibe. I would probably give this disc 3.5 stars instead of four, and that's just because there could've been more Dilla production."
2,Wack Album (Xtended Play Version 3.13),"Frank-N-Dank's ""Xtended Play Version 3.13"" was very disappointing, just another sterotypical wack Hip-Hop album. It showed a lot of Detroit pride, but I'm not from Detroit, so unless you are a Detroit native, you may not enjoy this album.The production from the first track, ""Okay"" by J. Dilla to ""My City"" by Oh No to Saukrates ""Nice 2 Meet U"" was not bad. It was more than decent, but Frank-N-Dank's unspectacular lyrics and content did not help out. I don't think there was one track on this album that was decent. I was disappointed in Kardinal's contribution who is a well-respected rapper. It was mostly trash and my favorable bias towards underground artists could not make me show leniency to this album.Don't buy it. Don't even download it."
4,works great,No problems with the paper. Works like a charm and I saved a lot of cash over what Office Depot wanted for the same thing.
4,Another Georges Crumb MUST !!!!,"Anyone interested in Crumb's highly mystical / spiritual MUSICAL WORLD should see / listen to this album from Bridge.Actually, anyone interested in fascinating contemporary music ow=es it to himself/herself to explore Georges Crumb's musical WORLD ... This album is a perfect way to start."
3,"Got the job done, but not elegantly","I had custom built-in cabinets installed in my office, but the carpenters did not do the file drawer hardware. The drawers were non-standard in size (a little over sized for letter sized file folders) so the fit was 'interesting'. I ended up buying these as they were exactly what I needed, but with a bit of customization.First, the rails are solid metal - you have to cut them with a hack saw to size, and the same for the covers. Also, the plastic things you screw into the wood to hold the rails has a screw on top and bottom. Good for stability, but bad if you have drawers like mine where they are just tall enough to let a file folder hang. I cut the top part off and attached with the bottom screw only.So, it was what I needed, but I had to customize to fit my particular drawer."
4,good value,Got this lense for my K100D. The price seems right and the pictures look good enough for me. No problem so far other than the telephoto is a bit tight.
4,My review of the Tamron Autofocus Aspherical Lens,"I am very happy with this product. Shortly after receiving the lens I used it on a road trip from Anchorage to Valdez. The temperatures were in the negatives, but the skies were clear and the views gorgeous. The lense worked wonderfully and I have fantastic pictures of my family and scenery to prove it. This lense is my general lense of choice for most of my photography. For someone on a budget like myself, this was the perfect lense."
5,The Best!,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. Unlike ""Executive Orders"", which was pretty boring to me, ""The Fist of God"" is a real page-turner! It's worth buying it!!!"
1,Can't this man afford an editor?,"While it may be true that this is an informative book about the Gulf War, its poor writing makes it almost painful to read:""The port arrived as if unbidden""""The elation among the pilots had been ecstatic""""He felt himself enfolded in the warm, comforting embrace of the kind, gentle stockbroker""""The twenty-four F-15E Strike Eagles crouched in silence, fearsome beasts waiting for the spidery little creatures of the same species who had designed and built them to climb aboard and unleash with insignificant fingertips their awful power""I have 8th grade students who can write better than this. Muddle through the book if you like, but be prepared for a lot of wincing."
5,Nail-biting book: Made me read it during my honeymoon,"I read this in 2003.Absolutely nail-biting and un-putdownable.Had bought it in an airport stopover during my honeymoon and absolutely could not put it down even at my hotel!Amazing book, and more so because the facts mirror closely."
2,Dissapointed,"The characters are dimensionless and symbol-like. The plot isOK, though there are too many unnecessary details. The narrationis like a newspaper account -- clear but what is to be enjoyed?I listened to the (abridged) cassette ediction. It was a dissapointment.I recommend John Le Carre, who is not known for researcheddetails. His characters are vividly presented, and the writing,not mush plot-driven, is witty and engaging."
4,Frederick Forsyths best novel yet!,The Fist of God starts at a breakneck pace and doesn't cease to the final word. Never has the author produced such a complex plot and action packed events.
1,Brakes don't work,Neat idea but needs work to make it safe. I bought this thinking my grandson might ride it and me also. It is too big for an 8 year old and the brakes don't stopit. I even took it to a bike shop and still no brakes. Might be ok for a scooter but not a bike. Too dangerous.
2,Bad product and defective material,"First of all, the brakes are not what you would rely on to stop the scooter. Second, the scooter is heavy and cumbersome. Thirdly, the scooter came with DEFECTIVE PARTS. I'm an engineer and I could not get the handlebars to fit the wheel. It was a wash out. I think that parts from other stuff were packed together. LASTLY, the instruction manual is so poorly designed as to illustrate nothing. You must look at what they have sent you and figure where what goes with what.Amen."
2,Kent Scooter,"I bought two of these for my kids for Xmas, both were poorly boxed and had marks or scratches on them! These scooters are clearly cheap and not a quality product! I also sent several emails to the manufacturer with my concerns with no response so that says alot. You get what you pay for these day's I guess??"
3,Consider Your Needs,"This product looks great! However looks can be deceiving for some. I purchased this scooter/bike to help my dog get more exercise with speed that went beyond my current jogging ability. With momentum, coasting was a bit sluggish on flat surfaces. Riding downhill was ok, but felt dangerous because the brakes didn't seem to have spot-on stopping power. Going uphill was tragic. Additionally, I found it extremely difficult to reach and use the peddles, which seemed to spin uselessly while the scooter was in motion. The seat is rock hard. So if you plan to purchase this product anyway, consider changing to a better quality seat and ride with protective gear and with caution, especially downhill."
4,Nice & Sturdy,"This bike is for my husband who is of average height and weight, and it is sufficiently sturdy for him. I thought it was a good price and value, it was a little difficult to align all the parts, but worth it in the end. I would not hesitate to purchase again."
2,Scooter/Bike,"This looks so fun and a bit odd, I just had to buy it for my 7yr old's B-day. The sad thing is, it is so heavy that he cannot ride it. It also is quite dangerous when going down even the slightest of inclines because it picks up speed so fast. For an adult, this is a fine product. The neck of the bike is very difficult to put together, and adusting the brakes is a daily thing. As far as for children I would not buy or recommend this product to anyone under 15. The seat does not lower even far enough for me at 5'tall (short) I have to lean so far forward to grab the handlebars that my balance is thrown way off.It is an interesting product, a real eyecatcher on the streets, but beware of all of the ""issues"" for children. I would not recommend this product to anyone that is not a dare devil and in perfect fitness, it takes a lot to pedal this bike."
4,Ken Scooter and Bike,"I like this scooter very much. I do have a problem with bursitis in my hip, and it is helping me to walk my dog. Especially because of both ways- scooter and bike. I will recommend it to many seniors, you can have lots of fun!"
3,"Fun, but a flawed design","The control module that facilitates the arcade scoring is mounted to...the back of the backboard.Now consider the irony here, a module who's only task is to count baskets, is easily destroyed by the impact caused by scoring baskets.We got a few of these for some office fun, and it is still pretty fun without the scoring, but I ended up calling huffy sports and they processed a claim today. Customer service was actually very good. The new module should be here early next week.I will update this review then.As a note, we bought two of these... and the other one seems to be working fine for now.Very addicting and very fun, but kind of a flawed design... If I am able, I plan to mount the new module on one of the legs where it will not receive so much impact."
3,"Pretty, but average","This is a very nice looking humidor, much better than what the pictures show. Inside is very roomy, and it comes with a good instruction booklet.Problem is, it doesn't work that well. The included humidifier didn't seem to maintain consistency, and my cigars were drying out fast. I bought a DryMistat humidifier, and it worked much better, but I think the seal isn't tight, as the humidity fluctuates a good deal.Good for smokers who only keep a few cigars on hand, and don't mind them drying out, but you may want to look at an alternative if you really want to keep cigars for a long time."
3,Humidor from Cheap humidors purchased on Amazon,"I purchased this from Amazon. The picture was quite different from the product itself. Furthermore, it was damaged (perhaps in transit) when I opened the package. I believe this was primarily due to poor packaging in the first place.Lastly, I had to pay duty on it when I recd it (in India). Amazon should ensure that they have these costs included in the overall pricing on their site, since the duty was over 40% of the cost of the Humidor itself.Overall, I am very disappointed with the process since I have always had good experiences on my purchases at Amazon."
3,earrings -OK,"They are pretty, but the backs don't fit right so the backings slide off and then the earrings fall off (happened three times so far...lucky I haven't lost them yet)."
3,Something to listen to,I should have listened to the playlist tracks before I purchased the whole CD. There were only about three songs that I really enjoyed.
3,one perspective,"More of look into days gone by than anything else. With that said, not all prior happenings are as we wish they could've been. Harpooning a tarpon? come on? Not a bad read, but this edition does not give the reader a quality view of the many drawings that were in the original print.Apparently, A.W. Dimock was an interesting guy. He made and lost several fortunes along the way-- on Wall street and specualting gold. Only a man with this kind of swagger could claim to be the first to catch a tarpon on rod and reel. In 1882?? Who knows?"
4,Billy Brown The Baby Sitter,This is an exciting book for young readers ages 4 to 7. Billy balks as he is charged with taking care of his baby brother.Things go south quickly when the baby buggy containing his sleeping baby brother gets away from Billy and makes a swift and precariousjourney through town with Billy chasing close behind.I read this as a child and still enjoy reading it to my grandchildren.
5,Excellent Blade Overall,"As many other reviewers said, the blade is closer to 8"", actually it is more precisely 8.05"" in diameter. I bought it for an early 90's model 8 1/4"" radial arm saw, and the ~1/8"" off each side really doesn't make a difference. Diablo blades are always great, clean cuts, never burns, and they last forever. Strongly recommend this product to anyone who needs a blade in that 8-8 1/4"" range, even though its closer to 8"" it will still perform admirably."
5,I forgot how good he was...,"...and how many chart topping hits he had during the Flower Power era. The best song, though, is one that I don't remember getting much air time back then. ""Catch the Wind"" is a haunting, sad, tale of unrequited love and very reminiscent of Bob Dylan's work in the words and the sound of it."
5,"Wonderful, music BUT WHERE IS ""OPEN ROAD"" ??????","Please, please, powers that be, re-release, ok Ill say it, thebest album ever made, ""OPEN ROAD"".Even better than theCure's Pornography. Have the tapes been lost? Donovan, if you read this PLEASE get ""OPEN ROAD"" back out. WE NEED IT!"
3,Colours and Catch the Wind = Alternate Versions Indeed !,"I have worn out the vinyl version of this album (loved it to death?) and I was horrified to learn that this reissue includes the ""folkie"" version of Colours and Catch the Wind from his I-wanna-be-Bob Dylan phase. Rotten! He even affects that terrible nasal voice that Dylan has. The other versions of those two songs were produced by Mickie Most (yardbirds) and arranged by John Paul Jones (led zep) and they sound beautiful with layered guitars and a Spectorish ""wall-of-sound"" quality to them. Please let me know if I can get those versions of those songs on CD! There not on this album....sad ---- dannycia@yahoo.com"
3,remastered,"Donovan apparently re-thought his performances on a few songs and put them on here. I was a little disappointed not to have the originals of ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Colors"" (or is that ""Colours""?) but the redone songs are ok I guess"
4,Well worth it.,Some times these old mixes don't live up to modern standards. To my un trained ear this sounded a ok even as an mp3. A good and memorable selection of tunes.
5,Great recording from the past,I was 13 or 14 when I saw Donovan at The Newport Folk Festival in R.I. A bunch of kids and I got to walk and sing Colours for some camera crew. I wish I could find the Video.
3,donovan greatest hits,"my opinion, i think these recordings were not remastered digitally. you can tell by turning up the volume. destortion sets in. i heard other epic/sony cd's that were digitally done and they sound more cleaner."
3,"Good music, if you can play it!","This is one of those Sony CDs that won't play on a Windows Media Player; however it will play on my friend's Apple laptop, and the music selection is excellent."
5,Excellent!,Arrived quickly in perfect condition. Love it! Needed a Donovan fix and got it right away!
5,The music of the 60's defined culture,"Hands down. The decade had it all: From bubble gum pop to novelties to psychedlic to the gods themselves (The Beatles!), you had your pick.I'm only in my late-20's but my music collection consists mostly of 60's music and Donovan's greatest hits package rocks from beginning to end. It's a must have for any music collection.My favorite cut is ""Epistle to Dippy."" I also like ""Mellow Yellow,"" ""Jennifer Juniper,"" ""Colours"" (nice and mellow), and especially ""Hurdy Gurdy Man.""Donovan's contributions to music can never be measured. He is a true legend."
4,trippin in the 60's,"Killer album, i havent heard since i was a kid. Brings back many excellent memories. Wheres my 25?"
4,All his hits,A fine collection especially with the inclusion of 4 bonus tracks. With these this one CD captures all of Donovan's charted hits with the exception of Universal Soldier (1965/53) and his two songs from 1971 and 1973. All his top ten hits are included here when Atlantis is included as a bonus. Sound quality is superb. A great value buy.
3,"Decent, but","Donovan reflects the 60s quite well: part folkie, part jingly poprocker, part psychedelic. At his best, he is a worthy, entertaining middleweight in the midst of Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, the Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield. The problem with this collection is that it is too light on the folkie part. The tracks added to the original LP (which I own) fill out the poprocker and psychedelic parts well, but another couple of early folkie recordings ('Universal Soldier'?) would round this out and make it worth my buying on CD.Also important is that this collection has for its two folkies the original singles versions of 'Colours' and 'Catch the Wind.' The old LP has later, longer versions of those songs, and the LP versions are superior. A definitive Donovan collection would feature both versions of those songs."
3,"Good chronology, but little more","I wouldn't say I disliked this book, but I did find it pretty short on both style and substance. It presents a good chronology of Lee's ACW campaigns, and might make a good prelude to a more detailed account if one wanted to get that chronology straight. However the prose is limp at best and details lacking. In his descriptions of the battles (especially) Burke Davis brings very little to life. For example, in the description of Chancellorsville, one never gets a sense that the battle is slipping out of Lee's control before his and Jackson's daring and innovative masterstroke changes the outcome completely.Credit should be given for good use of excerpts from Lee's correspondance which paint a picture of a gentle and humane man doing his duty bravely despite a mounting sense of the long-term hoelessness of the situation. But, more interesting material can be found than this historical overview for anyone who wants something serious on the subject."
5,Gray Fox: Immersion into the mind of an American hero.,"Davis does for Robert E. Lee what few biographers can do--provide the reader a present-tense sense of General Lee's emotions. In the Gray Fox, Davis shows Lee's stoic character, gently melded with a loving heart. Perhaps most important to the fledgling Confederacy, Davis demonstrates how Lee, like no other, could remain supremely cool and calm while under intense pressure as well as during those ""moment of truth"" decisions upon which the future of the Rebel nation depended."
4,A fascinating human portrait,"The Gray Fox was a new kind of biography for me. Actually it isn't even a real biography, more of a reflection of what a very wise man saw happening around him and how he tried to steer through all of it. Davis writes in a clear and accessible manner and does not overfeed you with data, which makes the book also a must for non-Civil War experts. The only thing which disappointed me was the extremely poor analysis of Longstreet. In The Gray Fox Davis blames Old Pete for almost every battlefield mistake the Confederates made. After a while, I almost thought Davis had some sort of grudge against Longstreet, because at some point his accusations become absurd. But apart from that, I can recommend this book, because of its slightly unconventional approach to biography writing."
2,Not User Friendly,"I am a finance profesional and found this product difficult to use, there is a lot of double entry and many simple task that are done the hard way, like entering deposits which unlike quicken is not done in the registar but in a deposit window, and then it is way to easy to get a deposit entered twice which in my short ownership has already occured at least five times. There are some excellent principals at work throughout the program and the ability to prepare invoices, and statments is essential for a business owner however their could be even greater ability to custimize reports. All in all I have been very unimpressed with this otherwise highly rated product."
2,looks great but not user friendly,This is very difficult to use if you are not selling wiggetts but a service. Hard to see the big picture or delete invoices. A problem at every turn. I am disappointed as I thought this was going to be great. I ended up getting an accountant.
1,Ahhh these guys do not even try,I have been using QB for 7 years and every year or so they force you to upgrade (buy a new copy) becuase they stop supporting online banking.I have recently purchased Microsoft Small Business 2006 which I am going to migrate my cursed QB files to it and I will finaly have some decent software.Problems with QBIt will not install sometimes - depending on the Windows installation it the install will crash.The Updates will crash periodically.It does not allow you to export reports to excel unless you have a Pro edition (Thanks)Also the interface online integration is circa 1990'sI have recently upgraded to MS Money 2006 which rocks!!!GOOD RIDDENCE QUICK BOOKS !!!!!1
1,Quickbooks Pro 2005,"My accountant said I should use quickbooks for my business. It turned out to be a very bad choice because the software does the manual tasks of paying bills etc. but gives you little useful information. I have a service business in a very competitive market and I could not get critical information that I needed to run my business.I had to go to the accountant and his staff to get the business information required to stay competitive. In the final analysis, I quess this is why the accountant recommended the product."
1,Cannot use on Windows 7,"I have no idea how this program works, because it will not load on Windows 7. Further research shows it may work on Windows 7 Pro, but that is not what I have. My previous version of Quickbook was great, and exactly what I need."
2,QuickBooks 2003 and 2004 have more going for them,"I've been a QuickBooks fan since starting up my company and realizing how much of a tremendous help QuickBooks was. I started out with QuickBooks 2003 and just a little while ago, I thought it was the time to upgrade to the latest and greatest. Well, I have to warn you that the latest, isn't the greatest. I still like QuickBooks 2003 much better, and in fact I sold my copy of 2005 on eBay and am continuing to use 2003. A lot of really handy features were removed from 2005, and many of them were the best features, like the E-Filing and E-Pay. I think I'm just going to stick with my current version of QuickBooks until Intuit gets on the ball again and puts these features back when they release 2006."
1,There are better software out there.,"I agree with the above users, there are better software out there. Please look around and be more futuristic. QuickBooks is for very small companies only. It slows down when the size of your database goes up. I tested some software and found some really good, with reasonable price: BusinessWorks, Small Business Manager (microsoft.com), Quick Business Manager (bisaim.com),Vision Point 2000 (ACCPAC), BusinessVision 32 (Softline).Good Luck in your search."
1,quickbook pro,"extremely poor technical support. I had to contact sales to get the answer because, Alex,Andrew,Adam all living in India could not answer the question and appeared not to really understand the question.I asked them why they use american names they said the company thought we the buyer might be more receptive if they use good old USA names. The program it self is fine I have been using it since 2002 but when a problem arises there is no support to count on."
2,"It has the basics, but much could be improved","I have been using QB Pro 2004 for over a year now. My main complaint is that online banking has been broken since installing (It's a credit card and a checking account...fairly simple, but can't get both to work at the same time. My QB-certified accountant can't get it to work either...if you want boring details, email me!)You've already read about how bad the phone support is...my experience was no different, and they want to charge you for everything.Hey Intuit, why not make sure the software that your customers purchase WORKS at least ONCE before charging for support?I can't believe after all these years that some other software giant can't crush these guys with something basic and workable. After reading reviews of all the accounting packages, it still appears that QB is the ""least worst"". ;-)"
1,I may never know if the product is usable......,"...I just installed quickbooks 2005, and have attempted to transfer my Quicken 2003 to Quickbooks 2005. The transfer will not copy beyond March 7, 2005. I called Customer Service and waited in excess of 20 minutes the first two times, only to be cut off...the third time I spoke to a rep after 17 minutes who told me I would need to purchase support for this problem....I think not! I may have wasted $229, but I will not waste any more money, or time with the so-called 'customer service'. More like 'customer rip-off'!"
1,2004 version was better!,"QuickBooks is getting worse and worse; I agree with J. Enzinna ""JonnyFunFun"". QuickBooks is also adding more and more adds in the software, so it is more frustrating.I wish Intuit would think of creating a better QuickBooks.Good Luck. Look for something else."
1,Nothing has changed at Intuit,"I just started a new business. About 10 years ago, I bought Quicken for a business I started then. A year later they offered me an upgrade...for MORE than I paid for the original version. Their customer service person gave me a lecture in the software business, and since then I swore I'd never buy another Intuit product.I was give a trial copy by my new accountant, and it seems to work well, but I need payroll. So, I logged on and was going to buy QuickBooks Pro 2005 here at Amazon...UNTIL I read the reviews of the HORRIBLE customer support, obviously outsourced to India.No thanks Intuit. I'd rather use a paper ledger than buy your product.Get some customer service and I'll consider you."
5,2005 QuickBooks,"I have been using QuickBooks since 2003 and have always enjoyed this financial software. I use Quicken for my personal finances, but QuickBooks is far superior. The 2005 version is very similiar to pervious versions, but they have made it extremely user-friendly. I have a member of my staff who is not very computer savvy, but she has done very well with this QuickBooks program. The only complaint I have has been with the installation onto my new laptop computer. It was extremely difficult! I called the customer service line to get help and the man that helped me was quick in diagnosing the problem. He walked me through the entire installation process and was very friendly. That is why, even with the installation problems, I still give the 2005 version of QuickBooks 5 stars!"
5,Small Business Accounting made easy,"I have recently started a small business. As most entreprenuers, I had the savy and technical knwledge, but no accounting. Quickbooks is very thorough, but can be difficult at first if you try to wing it without instructions. I give this 5 stars"
4,Very easy to use,I used Dac Easy (Sage Software) for 6 years and just switched to Quick Books Pro. QBP is light years easier than Dac Easy. What took me so long?
1,Upgrading from 2004,When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Joe
4,Quick Books Pro,The item whas worked well. I was a little bit confused about the mail-in-rebate. It stated that I needed to have owned a previous version to get the rebate. The product is great though.
1,Watch out if you use it for more than 1 payroll,I used the Quickbooks product to do basic bookkeeping and financial reporting for some of my clients. I do not use their payroll reporting at all because the program will not do all the state reports that I need. Before 2005 I could get the one time update and add the additional companies to my subscription so I could track their payroll and payroll liabilities. Now they want me to pay for a subscription in order to just keep track of the payroll for a few bookkeeping clients. I don't even do their payroll and I have to pay for a subscription to track data! I called customer support for both the P/R features and Intuit and that's the response they gave me. For $199.00 their payroll doesn't even do all the forms. I wouldn't mind it so much if I didn't have to pay to have another reporting program that exported the Quickbooks data to do ALL the forms necessary. What a waste.......
1,Last upgrade for a previously loyal Intuit customer,"I just purchased this product to upgrade my Quickbooks Pro 2003. Unfortunately, this will be my last purchase of an Intuit product after having been a loyal customer for 12 years. Why? Because I'm being forced to upgrade by Intuit or lose my ability to run the payroll feature (which I already have to pay a $200/year subscription fee to use). I have enjoyed using both Quickbooks and Quicken, but forcing me to upgrade at gunpoint is not something that sits well with me. Sorry Intuit, but time for us to go our separate ways. BTW: thanks Amazon for offering the upgrade $50 cheaper than direct for Intuit...one more nail in the coffin for Intuit and one more reason to remain a very happy Amazon stockholder."
2,ONLINE BANKING BUG !!,"The data received from my Financial Institution had savings data combined with checking data.I only wanted checking data, but the program will not let me delete savings data from the file, or reassign it to my savings register.Tech support disconnected me twice, spent over two hours on the phone and this issue was not resolved.Intuit customer support is very poor & verrry slow."
1,Warning! E-File and E-Pay Removed,After I installed and converted my file to the 2005 format I was informed that the E-File and E-Pay features were removed in version 2005. The support folk in India could not tell me if this was temporary or permanent. The only option to continue E-File and E-Pay was to remove version 2005 and reinstall version 2004. What a way to treat customers! How about some up front disclosure Intuit? I've been using Quickbooks for 7 years. This may be my last upgrade!
2,Not good for detailed retail sales,"I bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant. Well, after trying to use it for two years now, I'm ready to burn it. It's a great software for people who do their business by the projects, but it's not good for retail sales. Everything has been a hassel, especially trying to set up the daily sales so I can record detailed inventory of my daily sales. Yes, I noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales. After I already invested in $300 in software and $100 in books just trying to learn this system. What a waste!"
2,quickbooks review,"although quickbooks is a good program, when i ran into a problem and needed guidance, Intuit informed me i would have to pay to get the assistance i needed. I had only purchased the software 2 days ago.Do not expect any technical assistance from Intuit. I would not purchase this again if i had known how little assistance was available. I could do everything i needed to do with microsoft money and get a lot more free assistance with problems. faith paton"
4,Quickbooks 2005 Pro,This is a great product. It is easy to learn and use. It sure has saved me time and helps me save on taxes because I enter stuff now that I use to forget about or throw away.
1,Big Mistake,"Having used QuickBooks in my retail business for 7 years, I was ""gung-ho"" to upgrade to QB 2005. After doing so (easily), I used the product for one week when it stopped responding. It turns out that my data files had been corrupted. The 2005 format is not compatible with previous versions, so I had to recreate a week's worth of checks, payments, payroll, and desposits - a task that took the better part of a day. I pity a larger business that could easily spend much more time than I.After waiting on hold for 2 HOURS, I was instructed to e-mail some files to QB so that they could fix the errors and mail them back to me in a usuable format.. guess what - it's been 2 months and no one has responded to that, or several subsequent, e-mails... I'm glad I rolled back to 2004 on my own... now, if I can get someone on the phone to get a refund..."
2,Your software will shut off,Intuit has shut down my payroll calculating and tax form prep functions. How can they do this? You must purchase Intuit's expensive payroll subscription for the software to work as advertised. My five month old software no longer does payroll.I have entered the current tax rates and all should be well but...Intuit demands that I manually enter every single deduction on every single check. Isn't that great?
1,"Going, going, gone","Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break. I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated.The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions. I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted.I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime. If this is ""Quick Books,"" I need to find ""Lightning Fast"" Books somewhere."
1,Greedy,"I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money. Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help. It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers.And this customer will not be one next year."
2,Be Aware That the 2007 Edition is Shorter,"If you click on the other hardbound link of this book (the 1st edition that has a frilly golden border around the cover), you may notice that that book has almost 100 more pages than the current edition. The new edition is cheaper and must have omitted The Little Red Hen (which is why she no longer appears on the cover) as well as other stories I'm not yet sure of. I've had trouble before with Amazon sharing reviews between differing editions of a book with the same title. The other treasuries Animal Tales and Sleepytime Tales have been similarly condensed."
5,"Wonderful book, especially for rural kids",The two little Amish boys who live next door simply love this book. I ordered it from Amazon after checking it out the library and renewing it the maximum number of times to read to them. They relate to the animals and love the whimsy and illustrations. Excellent book!
4,Love the glass,"Looks and performs as expected, although the glass was a bit smaller than expected. It is not a whole lot larger than standard Vinum cabernet glass. Still an excellent value for a great product."
1,Get the real thing,"If you want some real hand made crystal glass.don't buy these Machine made, try the best crysatl item are from Belgium , CRYSTAL Val Saint Lambert."
5,astounding,"Judy Budnitz has created masterpieces. These stories are explored with lucid themes and magical depth.Among the stories that I remember most vividly is ""Elephant and Boy."" Its devastating yet inspiring. The personalities of the characters are so strong- but we can relate to them and recognize what they have to offer each other and the world.The last story is like a grand finale.unforgettable."
4,Great Book,"I own about half of the books that L'engle has written, and I love each and everyone one of them. This may not have been my favorite, but it was very good and an essential read for anyone who loves her work. It's following Vicky Austin and introduces Zach, who is in at least 2 other of her books, which makes this even more important to understanding his character, and Vicky's, more fully."
3,"Good, but Not the Best of L'Engle","It's kinda hard to get into -- especially if you've been to the places she's describing. At one point she states ""I won't tell you about it, for you can look it up in Nat'l Geographic."" Then you ponder that if she didn't tell you about these places, the book would be reduced by about ... 1/3.Great family dynamics, interesting story, feelings that every girl goes through, and definitely something that helps you understand ""A Ring of Endless Light"", which is something everyone should read."
