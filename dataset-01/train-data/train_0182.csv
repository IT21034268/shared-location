3,Propane stove toaster,"It takes a while to toast. The bread gets hard after a while, then finally starts to turn brown.""Start your toast 1st! before other items"""
2,Base Rusted as soon i washed for first time..but still works somewhat,"First time i Washed it rusted, the clamps were still fine and usable, no sign of rust on clamps. Toasts unevenly, have to make sure you flip your bread time to time to get even toasts. [...]"
2,Don't waste your time,"Doesn't work, tested it at home with a gas burner, did not toast my bread, a took a long time just to warm it."
5,Made toast just like old days before electric toasters,"One bright spot during Hurricane Sandy! Reminded me of childhood days. Would recommend it as part of emergency supplies just like flashlights, battery radios and bottled water."
4,Very Helpful Guide for a Very Difficult Game...,"I bought this book just to help me out on Minas Tirith - Top of the Wall - because I couldn't figure out exactly what I was supposed to be doing. I did refer to this book a couple of times along the way. I have just finished the game and re-playing some of the levels with different characters just for fun. If you are having any kind of trouble with this game, this guide offers some good tips. It is excellent at showing you how to beat all the bosses and finding missed items and offers some good strategies for each level. If you don't want to read any hints, then don't read the next few sentences. The guide book tells you how to defeat the Nazgul at the ""Black Gate"" with Aragorn. If you are having too much trouble doing this (as I did), change your character to Gandalf. Gandalf's magic arrows do ten times more damage to the Nazgul than if you use Gimli, Aragorn, or Legolas."
4,A bold life and true,"This describes briefly his early years in Abyssinia (today Ethiopia and Eritria), followed even more briefly by his schooling in England, before it gets to the juicy stuff, in the form of his friendship with Haile Selassi, his explorations of the least well known corners of North Africa and Arabia, his service in the Sudan and in WW2 in the SAS. I think he's still alive, as I read an account of an interview of his a couple of years ago (1997 or so) and he was still going strong then. Until a few years ago was still living in Africa, where he had been living in a native village in Kenya for about 20 years. I would especially recommend this if you have read his 'Arabian Sands' or the 'Marsh Arabs', as it would give you a much more complete idea of who he actually was."
4,"Highly creative, a bit uneven!","I've loved the idea of Gorillaz ever since I saw their first video. The Jamie Hewitt cartoons, the website, the concept... brilliant!And then of course, there's little details, like their music.The good news is that DEMON DAYS is a better album than the group's first one, which is unusual; there is no ""sophomore slump""! The ratio of good songs is much higher, and there is, of course, the absolute standout song, ""Feel Good Inc."" Tunes like ""Kids with Guns"" and ""November Has Come"" also have good melodies and witty lyrics.The so-so news is that I suspect that in a few years, I will be interested in about half of this album's songs, as quite a few sound like a talented person is noodling about in the studio without a lot of direction. This album is strong, but it's not something I'd play straight through, especially for a friend who is curious as to what is so great about Gorillaz."
3,Good -- hyped and trendy -- but good,"Its difficult to criticise this CD because its better than most that's out there right now. Its just that its undeniably trendy. The singer often sings through a filter like everybody else right now, so that his voice sounds scratchy and thin. I'm getting really bored of that.This is Blur with a funkier more eclectic beat. If that sounds interesting to you, this will be a great CD."
5,The new standard for second albums.,"I listened to it once and liked it. I listened again and it just got better. I love the overall feel the new album has (a playful yet ominous sound), but I especially like the last three tracks, which form sort of a mini-play. The closing title track will burn itself into your mind and (possibly) break your heart.It's a must-have."
3,It's Alright,"Hey, this album is alright. I don't ""like it"" but I don't ""hate it"". You're opinion. I still don't understand how this is a rock band. Anyway, Feel Good Inc, and Dirty Harry are pretty good tracks."
5,"Brilliant, Superb, and Twisted","Even though I haven't listened to the whole cd yet (I got up to track 10), I believe this album is the one album of the year that you can listen to and expect the unexpected. but to tell the the truth the only other time I listened to them was when they did a remix of one of their songs with D12. I just believed that they were just another band with a rapper in it, but I was wrong. This cd will keep me hooked second after second. The production of this cd is impressive because everything comes together even if it might seem out of place. Man if my friend didn't let me borrow this cd, I would of definitely missed out. All I can saw is that I am going to buy this cd as soon as I get my pay check."
1,My friends think I'm so hip now.,It's just techno garbage with stupid rap over it! Good thing all the members aren't black. Or this would've sold no copies. Good music for feel sorry for me white kids. You're so angsty and mysterious! Now go cut yourselves some more.
1,What is the hype about.(edited:part two.),"They have one cool video with a catchy little song to go with it, MTV plays it twenty times a day and all of the little kiddies go ""yea this sh*t is tight"". My brother mixed an album consisting of 9 tracks that sound better than this crap and he doesn't even have a contract with a label. Besides this has been done a few times by a guy named Beck, maybe you've heard of him? So basically if you are into this kind of stuff just buy a Beck album. Atleast it's better.Continued= WOW THIS IS FANTASTIC SO MANY NEGATIVE OPINIONS OF MY REVIEW. I GUESS THIS JUST PROVES MY POINT ABOUT THE STATE OF POPULAR MUSIC IN GENERAL! IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN 10 YEARS MOST PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS JOKE OF A ALBUM AND LAUGH! AND ALSO MAKE FUN OF THIS IN THE SAME WAY PEOPLE LAUGH AND JOKE ABOUT VANILLA ICE, OR WEIRD AL. OH WELL GUESS SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST STUPID OR ACTUALLY LISTEN WHEN MTV TELLS ""YOU"" WHEN SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD. LATER SHEEP!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"When I first bought this cd it was for one reason and one reason only...to get feel good inc. And it was a good song, that along with dare and dirty harry. But beyond that this cd sucks. The music is all either depressing or puts you to sleep. Its quite pathetic. So if you really want one of their singles just download them, but dont buy the cd."
1,ONE GOOD SONG...COMPLETE WASTE OF $10,"Feel Good Inc. is the only good song on the entire album...every other song is weird and boring. I couldn't listen to more than 30 seconds of all the other songs without wanting to go to the next one. In fact, I just bought the CD yesterday and I listed it this morning on eBay...I want at least part of the $10 I paid back!"
3,DVD was a disappointment,"The music CD was good and I enjoyed the overall selection of songs. The ""Bonus DVD"" however was a real disappointment. Only one song video and a bunch of ""interactive games"" that were more marketing oriented and a waste of time (I don't want or need a discount on buying the Gorillaz action figures!) Buy the CD - don't waste your time and money on the DVD/CD package."
4,Great for your collection,"Lots of tracks with a diverse collection of songs, all expertly performed and arranged. An upbeat soundtrack to add to your mix and kudos to the band for their innovative take on alternative rap."
4,surprisingly astounding,"Although I am not a big Gorillaz fan, (or hip-hop fan for that matter) I must say that this album was done extrememly well. The beats are catchy and although the feel is a bit strange, it does a great job in standing out from any other genre of music. The overall mix of genres is what makes this album so versatile in terms of audience. This album is trully amazing."
2,Not My Gorillaz,"Where's Miho Hatori?!Two listens now, and I think I'm done.Do not bother buying this expanded edition with DVD, it is an absolute waste.The first time i listened to the Gorillaz, I became excited, that some one was doing something new, catchy, and smart.This cd bores me so far, and I will try to listen to it again.Go to their website, and become as lost as I find myself now trying to describe my disappointment."
1,More Pablum for Modern Drones,"Another collection of rhythm overloaded, weak songs from a band that has much more talent (I hope) than this disc shows. But, it's a big hit with the trendy playlist crowd so they're making some money, which I hope will not produce a followup clone, but something actually original. Yuk!"
2,BEEN DONE BEFORE,"This album was unfortunately already made by a true rock band, trust me i love the gorillaz, but Pink Floyd produced this album under another name 20 years ago. So if you wanna hear the original recording, buy Dark Side of the Moon."
1,Trendy wimpy liberal crap you'll have forgotten about in six months,Skip this and pick up Wintersun instead.
4,Dan is the Man,"Dan the Automator is the man. A true talent in progressive music. The newest Gorillaz doesn't dissappoint, I do miss Del the funy homosapien."
4,diversity means...fantastic,"I wish i could say this album had the catchiest, coolest, oddest and most interesting songs i have ever heard, but owning Gorillaz's debut album ""Goillaz"" as well as DD makes that an impossible statement since they are both just as catchy and unique.Every track on DD is different from the one preceeding it, giving the cd such variety that it's hard to grow bored of listening. A cd with rap/hip hop influences, gospel, and rock influences..? how cool is *that*?The songs are mildly melancholy, but no one wants sometimes-sicking happiness all the time anyway."
1,"Is this the new ""Josie and the Pussycats?!?!?""","After listening to the much, much, much, MUCH hyped Gorillaz, I have to say that they are unquestionably one of the most overrated ""bands"" of all time. Damon Albarn was NOT Blur, by the way. That band was made up of FOUR very competent (and contributing!) musicians. And the whole idea of a cartoon band is about as original as the Archies (who were better).They've got a new CD coming out this month. Warn me if it's being played."
1,Ridiculous,It takes a lot for me to write an album review as I'm usually not overly swayed either way. But in the case of Demon Days I feel compelled to let everyone know what a galactic piece of dog turd this record is..I can't understand why this album is so wildly popular. Truthfully the only good track is Feelgood Inc. The rest of it is a montage of random loops spliced together creating something unmusical and utterly annoying.
1,Shelf stuffer,"The 1st album was great due to Dan the Automator's quirky beat making skills, which matched the Gorillaz style. Now there is a different producer doing the production, and the group no longer has the cartoony feel, which made it famous. I think the songs are dreadfully boring and lame. The 1st cd showed that you could be different musically and make it interesting. This album fails miserably in that regard."
5,Lyrics are NOT complete,"I love the CD. After 2 years I still can't get enough of it. However, I sprung for this enhanced version when I read that it contained complete lyrics. FYI: it does not.There are only fragments from each song and even those are clearly NOT what went to tape in some places."
2,"Automator, we miss ya...","The previous Gorillaz-album derived its sound for at least 80% from The Automator's deep & heavy beats, which gave most of the tracks a dark twist, contrasting well with the cartoonish image of the band. Now... it's just pop, with very generic beats, at that.So, it looks like this is a typical 2nd album after all. Hopefully the successor will be better.. perhaps they can sway The Automator to come back?"
4,The music draws you in...,"The music is a unique mix that really draws you into what you are listening too. I was not crazy about the title (a little creepy) the CD was a great surprise, because I like everything on it! Great sounds and great listening!!!"
4,very eccentric music,"their music is pretty funky and offbeat. i think it's fresh with beats and tunes that many have not heard before. it's the kind of music that you listen to while you're high or on mushrooms, as it extracts this dazed and altere-conscious emotion from you."
4,Who Asked Ray Davies to Do the Vocals?,"Gave this a listen the other day -- very strong, beat-heavy, groove-based material. Sounds to my ears a bit like Thomas Dolby, updated, with Ray Davies on vocals. Note the Kinks-like harmonies throughout. Very interesting sonically, cleanly-produced, this one is an interesting side project well worth the price of admission."
4,Demon Ways,"Demon Days improves on Gorillaz'sself-titled debut from 2001 with its ultra-funky and hippy sound track. Untypical of what Damon Albarn has done with Blur, Demon Days is more than an extension of their 2001 effort.Though titles like Every Planet We Reach Is Dead, Kids With Guns and Last Living Souls aren't exactly cheery, the album has its fair share of great vibes and grooves. The most outstanding track for me would be Don't Lose Your Way In Heaven, a I-Like-To-Teach- The-World-To-Sing, shake-your-head kind of song followed by the equally uplifting title track backed by a gospel choir. First single Feel Good Inc. robes in 80's soulster De La Soul for an uber-funky track that's bound to make you shake to the infectious beat. Dirty Harry brings in a children's choir and fuses it with rapping by Bootie Brown to great groove.A fantastic album."
3,"With changes, come...even more changes...","It's different, but who wouldn't expect it to be considering it has a new line up...however, it is not all that bad. If you liked the first Gorillaz CD you will probably like this."
4,Strong,"Ah, happy national cd release day.This album is great because of its tightness- beats are perfectly timed and the vocals are beautiful (missed Kool Keith though). The addition of Danger Mouse is clear. In short, you've got your Clint Eastwood (Feel Good Inc.) and every other track is strong. If there's any justice in the music industry 'Demon Days' should be an early entry for Album of the Year."
4,Quirky and charming,"This album has grown and grown on me. I wanted to write about the first six proper songs forming the heart of the album and the rest being disposable, but it's really not true. Every track has something interesting to offer. Funky beats, weird minor keys, little accents here and there. You have to appreciate the perspective of the creators of this album, the supremely playful and simultaneously world weary affect of pop veterans, who have seen it all and yet still want to mess with the form and function of their music. This is the work of an artist at the height of his powers who respects his audience. I can appreciate how people might listen to this and go WTF? But give it a chance. For every excess there's a hidden gem."
4,Demon Days,"I bought the album for only a few songs, but found that the songs were much better than I expected. It also has a good range of different genres all in one album. For the most part, it was very enjoyable, only a couple of songs were a bit grating."
3,too much creativity and musical diversity,"Hi. I'm a moron. I heard Feel Good Inc. and Dare on the radio so I went out and bought this CD. I tried listening to the whole CD but all the other songs didn't sound exactly like Feel Good Inc. and Dare so I have to say this CD sucks. My moron ears only want to hear what's on the radio, that's all I can handle. So to not feel like I wasted my money I put Feel Good Inc. on repeat and listen to it endlessly over and over while I stare at the radio drooling like the moron zombie that I am."
4,Better than the debut,"I really liked the Gorillaz debut album, but I like this one better. It's certainly darker and more atmospheric, but no less catchy -- just a little more complex and unpredictable. I find this to be a lot more Danger Mouse than Blur (not that I know Danger Mouse beyond the Gray Album, and not that I was ever all that into Blur), but it's not really either.I think if you like Mr. Bungle and DJ Shadow, you might like this. It falls somewhere in between them in terms of intensity, and it's slicker than either, but like them, it's musically sophisticated, stoppy-and-starty, and not afraid to lurch from cool thing to cool thing."
3,Keep up with the Joneses.,"I really liked the first Gorillaz album. The standard beat structures fitted in nicely to what I categorise as ""music"". Well unfortunately, I found some of the quirky songs on this album a bit ""left of centre"" for my narrow musical taste. I just bought it anyway so I could have a cool disc in my collection. Now when my friends come over I will still be accepted by them when they say ""Oh I have that CD too!"""
2,Demon Days Gorillaz,it is alright. i like only one main song. the others are not what type of music that i am really into.
5,found a voice,"In a musical time when everyone is digging for buried treasure and loves someone differant I think I have found cashe of musical gold. I was watching Mtv and saw the video to Feel Good Inc. and it brought back the good memories I had to their first self titled album. After a week passed the feeling stayed with me and I could not get the haunting Windmill chorus out of my head so I went and bought the album. I grew imediatly attatched and experianced no buyer remorse as I usually end up going through. As forementioned each track is a differant experiance and sets you aflight in a surreal world of complex lyrics (raps and singing alike),and an illustrous musical landscape. The only real miss in the bunch is white light. The standouts include Feel Good Inc, Manana, and Dare. This is highly recomended to anyone else looking for treasure."
5,AMAZING!,"Everything is great about this CD - The lyrics, the vocals of both Danny and Mick and the music! These guys have worked very hard and it shows! Just listen to it - You'll see!"
3,nice simple film,This Dutch film running only 58 movies is about an illiterate baker who through his friends decides to reply to a personal ad. The woman is a librarian and after months of correspondence she decides to visit him. Only the visit is hardly what she excepted. Town life is very quiet and he is not the man she pictured. Will she come to like him for what he is? If you like this you should also check out Paul Cox's Lonely Hearts.
5,Great book,"This book is extremely useful if you are any type of runner. If you are just starting, or if you want to run a great marathon...whatever. Definetly buy this book if you have any interest in getting better at running and learning some new stuff about the sport. A truly useful guide."
5,All questions answered!,"This book leaves nothing to the imagination! What I also really liked is that it doesn't assume anything about you - if it's advice that is more directed to one type of athlete vs. another, it lets you know which, so you're not being led astray by advice better suited for someone else. It's perfectly organized, so that it's easy to quickly find information that you want now, has a chart that ranks your present performance so you know how you fare against other runners in your age, and gives advice based on where YOU are at specifically, not anyone else! This will be my first race ever (I've been a runner for a while now, but have never competed) and in reading this book, I feel that I have all of the knowledge I need (except experience) to do my best!"
2,Charts too small in kindle,Kindle Version only: I ended up buying this book in print after I found that many of the charts were impossible to read on the Kindle. This is just one of the reasons I have been disappointed with the Kindle.
3,kilometers please!!,"I love this book, I really do. Much like all of the other reviewers I commend it's content.However, I've really had to work hard to read this book. Everything is in miles! In fact, worse, it mixes up miles and kilometers! I've had to build myself a metric conversion table on the front cover.Please Bob and Shelly-Lynn, just use kilometers and be done with it.To quote ukmetrication.com:""96% of the world's population use the simpler, more convenient & easier to understand metric system.""AND""the only countries that still use the imperial system are America, Myanmar, Yemen, Liberia (West Africa), North and South Yemen, Rwanda and Burundi."""
5,Awesome Resource!,"I've been running seriously for about 2 years and have placed in several 5K's and completed 2 half marathon's. I wish I had discovered this book long ago! It is very comprehensive, and will be a tremendous resource to me as I continue to run/race and work toward completing my first full marathon. The book covers everything, and probably many things you may not be interested in, but that's ok as you can skip over those sections. The technical information is presented in an easy to read/understand style, and there are numerous charts and tables that make things even easier. No matter where you are in your running, this book is a must have!"
2,"""competitive"" ? runners handbook","This book was a major dissapointment. I bought the original 25+ years ago when I was running in High School and loved it. When I saw there was an ""updated"" version I jumped at the chance to buy it. Mistake! I learned nothing new from this book and it was not as good as the original. It is a dumbed down version of the original more designed for beginning weekend warrior than a real ""competitive runner"". If you are satisfied being a middle of the pack runner this is the book for you. If you are a competitive runner don't bother. Buy either Pete Phitzingers book or Brad Hudsons they are Excellent!"
4,Lots of good advice,"This book has a lot of good advice, but I think it's not exactly what I'm looking for with my own training. The training program advocates lots and lots of miles, even for someone who is not a distance runner. I found that when I upped my mileage in order to improve my performance for a 5k, I was breaking my body down, and my 5k performance actually suffered. Now I'm going the Run Less, Run Faster route and I'm feeling a lot stronger. Many different methods for training, this one just wasn't the one that works for my body."
4,Good book for runners of all types,"I am still reading this book but what I have read so far has been good. In addition to running, I enjoy biking, swimming and working out so some of the aspects of this book as far as weekly milage and the number of running workouts just can't be fit in with the other sports I enjoy. However, I feel this book will help me to be a better and faster runner even if I do have to modify the amount of time and runs recommended.For those who only run; whether a 5k runner or a marathon runner, I think this book has relevant and easy to understand information that will benefit anyone who reads it."
3,Good Enough,"This is my least favorite running book although it is written competently enough. Too much childish ego on the part of the authors detracts from an otherwise good enough book. The best part of the book for me was the discussion of heart rate training, something that is barely mentioned in many of the other running books. There is also not enough explanation on developing training schedules which wasn't too much of a surprise since the authors sell guess what?... training schedules and coaching. Worth buying but not the best."
4,Great Book but a lot of information,This book was a little overwhelming for me. I found it to be a little too much information. Definatly not for new runner's.
5,Not the least disappointed,"I read the reviews, bought the book, and was not disappointed. This is a thorough treatment covering all the bases. If you're going to run, you need to race to stay motivated. This book will help you prepare intelligently and save yourself from the two dreaded extremes: under and overtraining. If you are a half serious runner, whether beginner or advanced-- this book will be a highly valued resource. Much thanks to the authors!"
5,Written by a certified sex therapist,"Written by certified sex therapist Darcy Luadzers, Virgin Sex is an informed and informative guide written especially for women and which deals honestly and intelligently with the hard questions of sex. Virgin Sex directly addresses issues that particularly concern young virgins, such as ""how will I know when I am ready/not ready?"", as well as how to make one's first experience a memory to cherish. Virgin Sex is also filled from cover to cover with solid advice appropriate for women of all ages including how to recognize men who are only interested in sex -- not a relationship; how to prevent and avoid rape; how to make sex pleasurable, not painful; and more. Very highly recommended for Human Sexuality reading lists and library collections."
3,This Book Is Hilarious,"And bears about as much resemblance to reality as a driver's manual does to actual driving. I'm sorry, I know it was written with serious intent, but I came across it in a library and HAD to skim through it, as you would, too, admit it, and within minutes I was laughing so hard I had to get up and go outside. (Once I start giggling I'm hopeless.) Someone I used to date works at the same library and asked me what was so funny and I told him and he said, ""Yeah, we're always finding that book hidden in corners where people take it and sneak off to read."" (Hey, at least I read it in the open.) Soooo, if it helps even a single person (although how it could is past me, it reads like stereo assembly instructions, and I think the author is out of touch) then great, but in my opinion it seemed pretty silly."
4,"aka ""The Sleepy Jackson""","Yep these boys are the latest ejectees from Luke Steeles disposable pop band ""The Sleepy Jackson""At first I thought here we go,angry pop band rejects hanging on to some fine thread of notorierty. But to my surprise they are very good,original and most of all ""They ROCK""EOF produce a refreshing brand of pop rock that is so typical of whats goin down on the West Coast of OZ with other popular rockers like Jebediah and Eskimoe Joe."
2,Chock Full O' Errors,"I'm up to chapter 8 in this book, after nearly three months of plodding through the examples. Conceptually this would have been a great book, but there are critical typos, erros and mistakes in almost every example. Be prepared, when doing the examples, to be debugging not only your own mistakes but also those of the Author, and there are a lot of them. This can be very daunting for the beginner as you are never sure exactly how to fix some of these mistakes without research, trial and error and a lot of luck."
2,Good Idea but too Buggy,"While the principle behind the book is good, I find myself wasting most of my time debugging the author's examples and deciphering omissions. I believe your money would be better spent on a different book."
3,Good Read,A solid overall novel. You get the perspective of both the hunter and the hunter. The beauty of this little story is how the roles change. The ending was extremely well done and definitely left you with questions and wanting a bit more. Do yourself a favor and check it out before you see the movie.
2,Uneven and ultimately disappointing,"This book promises to ""solve"" the mystery of who killed the Black Dahlia, but the outcome seems highly contrived and, I suspect, not entirely true. The book does paint an interesting picture of Elizabeth Short and her wanderings but important events often lack dates or sources, which suggests to me that much of this book is pure fiction. I'm no quicker to believe the solution in another book, ""Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer"" (Knowlton / Newton), but I found that book more satisfying. We'll probably never know for sure who killed the Dahlia (or why). ""Severed"" is definitely worth reading, but I doubt it's the once-and-for-all ""solution"" it promises to be. Some of the author's claims of first-hand knowledge-- including meeting the Dahlia when he was an 11-year-old kid (!) AND, as an adult, actually knowing her killer (!!)-- are, to me, a little insulting. P.S. Beware of a few disturbing photos."
2,Does anyone notice...,"That he doesn't cite ANYTHING? He quotes all over the place and makes sweeping claims, but has absolutely no reference list. I don't understand how this is acceptable. He starts out with pure fiction--what boy on a bike? how does he know what that boy, IF he exists, felt about seeing the car?--and it goes on through the book. I feel like he often sacrifices fact for atmosphere. He certainly has an agenda, like everyone who writes Dahlia books. They don't sell if there isn't a whodunit at the end and he certainly has his pet theory, i.e. Jack Anderson Wilson. He sure flogs the hell out of that one. It's sad to read the transcripts of that sodden drunk taking advantage of him."
5,COLIN WILSON IS RIGHT!,"Severed is by far the best book on the Black Dahlia, in fact, as Colin Wilson says, it is the only reliable book. Not only was it the first nonfiction book ever published on the subject, but John Gilmore, having spent years researching the case, it is also one of the most exciting and penetrating true crime books ever written. The few who call it ""junk"" and etc, are not grasping the essence of what this book is all about. This is a work of literature, of history, a deep excavation of L.A. as it was during the classic era!As for the suspect, Gilmore took what he uncovered to the LAPD and placed it in their hands. FBI profiler John Douglas has even endorsed Gilmore's suspect. Gilmore makes the strong point that the case can never be solved. He opened the door to discovering the Black Dahlia in full dimension. For those who want to understand what this case was all about, read Severed first."
4,A STUNNING BOOK,"The Black Dahlia case has always fascinated me as I am sure it has many people. I have read other accounts or books inspired by the case, but this one is the only book that digs beneath the surface. Not only is this a fascinating account of a notorious, still (officially) unsolved homicide (plus another unsolved murder of a Sunset Strip socialite)), but it is also an historical observation of the seedy underworld of Hollywood/Los Angeles after the Second World War. The morgue photographs of Elizabeth Short are absolutely chilling, particularly the head shot. The photos of the Sunset Strip socialite in the morgue, and when her body was discovered in the bathtub of her Hollywood apartment are most unforgettable. I'm anxious to read other books by this author."
1,As I Said Before,"25% mistakes, 50% fiction. Full of people who do not exist and things that never happened (all of which have been picked up by supposedly reputable websites without the slightest shred of skepticism--right down to the misspelled names). Don't take my word for it. Check any chapter against the original newspapers, telephone directories and other 1940s resources.I'm still laughing about the nonexistent ""Hollywood police chief"" (Page 150) or the fact that the house where Elizabeth Short was supposedly murdered has moved several blocks over the last 20 years. Don't you just hate it when murder scenes migrate like that? Talk about sneaky!"
4,A Warning!!!,"My Da got this book from the library,and found it very thorough, deeply studied, well-written. I might have read it myself, as true crime and historical events are of interest to me,but I had the misfortune to open the book to a photograph of poor Miss Short's corpse.It has haunted me to this day.I encourage all ladies to avoid this book, due to the photographs, and gentlemen,also,if they are easilly distressed."
1,Disappointed with the book,I have read all the books written about the Black Dahlia. This one was a waste of my time. Is this a fiction book?
1,"Good information, poor organization",I was extremely disappointed by this book. The author's writing style and lack of organization hinders understanding. Many more questions are left unanswered than are answered! It's a shame because the author is obviously an expert on thecase but who can figure out what's going on from his text? Simple things like dates (even just years!) are missing. Characters are developed in great depth than suddenly dropped. New charcters are poorly introduced. Pictures are in the book but no mention of their subject is found in the text. No rhyme no reason. I hope someone writes a more definite book on this case in the style of a Bugliosi (Helter Skelter) which answers all questions. The one star is for info gleaned on the case.
3,Gruesome and Engrossing,"Admittedly, I have a bit of an obsession for true crime books, and unsolved crimes. I found this book an addictive read, and was unable to put it down until I finished it. While the style of the writing leaves something to be desired, the author provides just enough history to make the reader feel he/she knows something about the victim, without ever really getting to know her, thus not completely removing the veil of mystery. As for his theory on who actually did the murder, it seems plausible, but I guess we'll never really know."
5,Daring & Exciting,"This book is highly recommended for all those interested in the true crime/crime literature field. An excellent read. The author traces the victim of a savage crime, and the enigmatic killer trail with inexhaustible expertise. The scenes inside the Los Angeles County Morgue are chilling and disturbing. Gilmore has done an amazing job of exploring a world only a few of us enter. This is for sure the dark side of the moon. A tragic and compelling tale."
3,Disapointed,"I was especially disappointed with how the author presented his solution to the crime. Spread out over the last few chapters, Gilmore leads readers through the identification of the killer and how the murder was committed (supposedly as told by an informant) in a rambling, stumbling fashion, with errors in several confusing yet critical passages. In the writing, he misidentifies: a) the informant with b) the informant's source with c) the person identified by the source as the killer. (You see, in the story, we have an informant talking about another informant talking about another source talking about the killer.) I had to read and re-read the passages, pages, and the final chapters to realize that the writer and editors screwed up. In short, I found the book interesting, informative, but a very confusing read."
3,"All hat, no cattle.","While I was grateful to finally find something well-reseached and lengthy about this famous case, the conclusions the author comes to regarding the identity of the killer don't hold water for me. Why can't someone just publish the facts of a famous unsolved crime without having to try to solve it? And why does the alleged culprit always conveniently die before he can be questioned or brought to trial? The comparisons Gilmore makes between the Dahlia case and the other one discussed in the book don't add up. In fact, the only similarity to me is that the victims were both murdered and the cases both unsolved. After that, it's all speculation and wild stretches of the imagination. To me, the case still remains a mystery. And that's the way I like it."
5,DEFINITIVE ACCOUNT OF WHAT PROBABLY HAPPENED,"This is probably the most complete account of the Black Dahlia, and the search for her killer. Author Gilmore claims to have found the killer, and explains his meetings with him before his mysterious death. This book details Elizabeth Shorts backgound from growing up in Massachusetts, migrating to L.A. and falling for servicemen while mingling in the Hollywood nightlife scene to ending up split in half on a sidewalk at 39th and Norton. John Gilmore really put a lot of effort into finding every little detail about the Dahlia, suspected killers, the dump site, police reports, media frenzy etc, etc. Really a masterpiece of true crime investigation."
5,THIS is the Black Dahlia!,"At last I have had the opportunity to of discovereing who the Black Dahlia really was. Nothing else I have ever read comes close to the revelations contained in book, about the young woman, Elizabeth Short, known in Hollywood circles as the Black Dahila. This beautiful young woman suffered the most horrible death imaginable. Apart from this being one of the most horrendous and mysterious crimes in the history of Los Angeles (and certainly in the annals of modern crime), John Gilmore's book has opened for me the world of Elizabeth Short, young, exciting, yet strange and diffident. I cannot imagine another account that approaches as clear an understanding of the Black Dahlia, or of her tormented, secretive existance, her dreams, her desires, the yearning for fame that alwasy sadly slipped out of her reach. A fine, excellent book."
2,Second half disappoints,"I have to agree that the first half of the book is very thorough and well done. But from the point of the murder forward, things just fall apart. There seems to be no logic in the presentation of the case. For example, he reproduces large segments of the autopsy reports for both the victim and the suspect without pointing out the significance of anything. He seems to spend an inordinate amount of time proving facts that have little or no significance whatsoever. I was disappointed that he failed to introduce any psychological forensics to support his case. And he produces little or no concrete evidence to support either his thesis for the murderer or the linkage between both murders. I wish he could have been as thorough in the second half of the book as he was in the first."
5,THE DIRTY HEART OF L.A.,"A fantastic read! All the other books about the mysterious Black Dahlia fade beside John Gilmore's SEVERED. I read the Granta edition in London last year, and recently finished the US edition. I am reading it again. The story, the superb writing, the strange tale draws you in. A post-War time in Los Angeles comes to life and it is gritty and dirty, the people are driven by dog-eat-dog agendas. The Black Dahlia is totally captivating. I feel like I know her, like she is real and I'm enamored with her. I can reach out and touch her. I've got author Gilmore to thank or curse for that! The gangsters, sexpots, soldiers and sailors, the lonely hearts and killers are here. Also a handful of ordinary people like myself, caught by the charms or spells of the Black Dahlia as she steps from the darkness into your life. This has to be a movie!"
2,Interesting but bland,"Before this book, I knew next to nothing of the Black Dahlia case. Thanks to this book I am more informed BUT I can't help but feel really disappointed. The writing was pretty mediocre plus the book feels disorganized and vague. For instance, the author give no sense of time. When the book ends I assumed that roughly 20 years had been covered, when in fact 40 had. Some interesting info but muddled and confusing."
2,Is it fiction or non-fiction???,"John Gilmore's ""Severed"" provides readers with an enjoyable read, but you wonder, it it fiction of non-fiction? One can not deny the book is a pleasure to read. For serious students of history and those actively researching the death of Elizabeth Short, it is seriously flawed. Even the most fundamental research reveals numerous errors in the book. Gilmore does nothing to support his findings. No footnotes, no bibliography, nothing to allow the reader to confirm his conclusions. Gilmore expects the reader to accept his words as gospel, no proof needed. Buyer beware!"
3,Facinating but muddled...,"The Black Dahlia case is a truly haunting one. The book does a good job of letting you kow the facts of the murder of Elizabeth Short, but unfortunately is very disorganized and confusing. The narrative jumps back and forth in time and makes illogical connections (such as attemping to prove that the Black Dahlia murder and another murder of a socialite are connected because the Dahlia was most likely dismembered in a bathtub and the socialite was found in a bathtub). A good book for an overview, and the pictures are disturbing and unflinching. A more believable denoument to this story was given in the History Channel special ""Crimes in Time."""
4,Haunting,"I got interested in this story from playing the L.A. NOIRE videogame. The true story is nothing like the story from James Ellroy's novel (and the later film by Brian De Palma starring Josh Hartnett). The book is a quick read, but will stay with you for a while. The brutal nature of the crime is so haunting that it chills you to think that no one was ever charged and sentenced. The story of Elizabeth Short was very interesting, even prior to her murder. It was one of the better true crime books that I have read.I really like true crime stories because I find the work of detective and forensics so fascinating; how they have to piece together an event and paint a portrait of a victim and criminal's life from gathering clues. It takes a very special kind of person to do this kind of work and do it well."
4,hard to put down!,"""Severed"" was extremely hard to put down! the photos were fantastic - many of which I hadn't seen before. the map of Los Angeles gives the reader the proximity of the crime as well as many of the Black Dahlia's Hollywood hangouts that no longer exist. my only complaint is that a few of the chapters read like a police report - where the victim was on this particular day, who she was with, what they did, etc. after a few of these chapters, you get an idea of what Elizabeth Short's day to day life was like & you're ready for some new insight. the attention to detail shows that the author really has done his homework on this gruesome murder & upturned just about every stone . . ."
1,NO PROOF,"I didn't like this book. I expected an exciting read; after all, this book was touted as the ""definitive"" story of Elizabeth Short and claims to also ""solve"" the mystery of who really killed her. Instead I found it extremely dull and unconvincing. Gilmore writes in an exceedingly tedious style; perhaps he was trying for an authentic ""film noir"" feel by using language and dialogue that is terse and inarticulate. I was reading about a grisy unsolved murder that captures peoples' attention to this very day, and it was putting me to sleep! And as for revealing the true murderer...well, I just have this to say to Mr. Gilmore. In order to solve a murder, you have to have cold, hard PROOF. Not heresay. Not speculation. PROOF. And Gilmore has none. This book was a major disappointment for me. I'm still waiting for a good book to be written about he Black Dahlia; she certainly deserves better than this."
1,lost of money,"these seller SUCKS!!!! toke my money and NEVER send me the product, i wrotte to amazon and to seller too, and NOTHING happened... wait yeah something really happened, i spend my money in NOTHING!!!!!!!"
5,I love moose,so I love this sweatshirt. It fits perfectly and feels cozy. thank you. I've washed it and it hasn't shrunk.
5,Goodbye Corning-ware,"When my large casserole dish smashed onto the floor, I started looking for an unbreakable replacement with a snug cover and good handles. I also wanted good value. This quality, Multiclad pan is a tremendous deal. It cooks well on the stove or in it. It looks snazzy while serving and cleans easily. It is large enough for a grand one dish meal such as paella. I have many (14) Cuisinart pots and pans and this beauty completes the collection. Uh, well maybe. One thing more...clear off the top of your fridge because a pan of this size has a broad footprint."
1,??????????,"I bought this hoping for some good stuff from Satoshi as usual but now it's just a dust collector. This is one of those albums that will leave you scratching your head!! This is certainly not the Satoshi that we all have come to know and like!! And that is likewise for the label as well. As for the first disk I was like ""What the....."" The second disk is a continuation of ""What the Hell......"" and the third disk said it all ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP!!!!!!"" Do not buy unless you really, really, really like retro disco with a whole bunch of cheese mixed in!!! At least that is what this set reminded me of. I'm really starting to loose faith in electronic music because of crap like this. No wonder why I buy the older choons from ebay when I find-em. Remember folks....Just Say No To Oakie!!!"
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I am a huge Satoshi fan. When I purchase a compilation from a well respected DJ from such a wonderful series such as Renaissance...I expect to get something..well...a little more than what I got. I expect to get a release full of new tracks...and not simply remixed versions of older works found in other CD's.Don't get me wrong...there are some excellent tracks on these discs, however...there is the occasional old and played out selection that throws me off. I want to hear some new stuff...definatly not the exact same tracks found in previous releases."
5,The Next Beautiful Soul!!! LOL,"This is an awesome record, it is extremely catchy, and I love listening to it, I am already obsessed, Jesse has pulled it off again, which isn't surprising. I am in total agreement with Mindy P's post which states the album as incredible, which it is, I would encourage anybody to get this album and enjoy it as I know I will.I am really fifteen, but I don't have a log in so... I use the kid's form...LOL"
5,Not A Kid Just Didn't Feel Like Signing In,I've been a fan since 1999 and it's nice to have his music mature a long with you. When I was young his music was bubble gum pop stuff and now that I'm older it's more mature and grown up. 'Invincible' is easiest the best song on the album. I remember hearing about his friend dying back in '03 and how upset he was about it and it was so amazing to hear the emotion played out through a song. To the other persons review it's all in perspective if it's dirty or not. You can choose to make the lyrics mean what you want them to mean. Younger kids probably wouldn't notice the things you do about the lyrics. Remember Dream Street? Looking back at their lyrics they're not as sqeaky clean as I used to think as a kid.
3,Ehh...average?,"This is the type of music I would definately buy, but...At the same time, his lyrics are kinda, strange, and his songs are a bit pointless. I think he should try writing his own songs, maybe he can think up some DEEP lyrics instead of the songwriter's lyrics. (Unless he writes his own songs already). I don't have any money, but if I did, I wouldn't drop it on this album His songs also sounded the same. The tunes kinda sounded the same for the songs I listened to. I'm sure I can always get my dad to buy me an album, but it won't be this one."
1,Uhh no!,"The songs are all about Jesse doing IT with his girlfriend. god what a stupid allbum. Jesse you can't sing anyway, so why anybody would slep with you anyway is beyond me...AARON CARTER RIPOFF!"
2,Not his best,I am a Jesse fan but this cd of his lacks great songs and is my least favorite of his albums.
5,EXCELLENT,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD. I REALLY LIKED ALL OF THE SONGS. EACH SONG HAS A STORY OR A MEANING BEHIND IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO JESSE'S FANS.
4,Enjoyable inspite of being cheesy to the core,"If you like cheesy pop music, you'll love this album. I thought some of the songs had good melodies and others were quite catchy. Not the best music out there, but it seems to sort of suit Jesse McCartney, which is why it works. Theres nothing 'Wow' or Breakthrough on this album, but it's quite the enjoyable listen."
5,I Love It.,"I may be a teenager, and a Jesse fan, but my area of expertise is music.I bought this album off of iTunes for 10 bucks, and I think it's safe to say that it should have been more.I enjoy every song on here, and I definitely am not sick of it yet.I own ""Beautiful Soul"" as well, and it is quite a bit different from this album. It's not as edgy, and the tracks are all about falling in love. This album, however, is quite a bit different...Blow Your Mind is about Jesse being sexually attracted to a woman {NOT on Beautiful Soul...}, Invincible is about drinking and driving, and Just Go is about Jesse pushing a woman away {on Beautiful Soul he was embracing them}.I like this album, just because Jesse makes the music his own."
4,It's not dreamstreet.,This man has grown into life and his music shows it this former boyband member(dreamstreet)is a man who enjoys singing and it shows in this recording it's not for those expecting anything like his former boyband status it rocks it rolls it's a good listen unlike justin timberlake his is himself on this cd and i like and i would say give it a listen.
2,My two cents - it's worth little more,"Like its newer cousin which I unfortunately ordered at the same time - I found this book boring. Too many of the questions were really easy - and it wasn't because I'm too smart for the book. When you check the answers, quite a few of them indicate that 80%-100% of Mensans got the questions correct. On top of that nearly half the book is devoted to trivia and vocabulary. With these you either know the answer or you don't - there's no intelligence involved - only familiarity.I assumed this book would entertain me for a day. I hoped it would entertain me for a weekend. Instead it bored me for a little over an hour as I took the quizzes. If you're looking for tests of logic, reasoning, and mathematics skills then this book will be of minimal interest to you."
5,Very good,"This charm has a terrific size, it is wonderfully made and, if it becomes available again, I will buy it. I would recommend this charm to anyone."
5,Unusually Fine,"The Clemencic Consort is most splendid and in top form on this unusual disc. The music serves to showcase the virtuosity of the individual performers and the unique historical instruments the consort employs. Rene Clemencic is known as a visionary in his approach and he does not disappoint here. The vocals are haunting, especially in ""La Mort de Moliere"" -- nothing short of devastating, kindly pardon me."
5,A beautiful rare gem from the soundtracks universe,"I bought this CD with certain hesitation because it is a soundtrack. However, when hearing it the subtle sounds, the masterful interpretations, the beautiful voices of Marjorie Vance and Elisabeth Guy-Kummer and the master direction of Rene Clemencic, moved my soul tremendously. La Princesse Elide, Carnaval et Revolte, Armande and La Mort de Moliere will be, for sure, amongst the favourites of most listeners of this not to be missed album, a rare find in Amazon.com although normal in Amazon.fr. And hear carefully to the compelling percussions in La Foire de Toulouse. Buy and enjoy."
3,Too subtle,"This smells (OK). It really is a timid smell that really wont remind you of a real weed smell, but it is not bad. Maybe I was expecting too much or anticipating too much but this smell wont be readily recognizable."
4,"I like it, but it doesn't actually smell like cannabis.","It is a good, non-specific, subtle scent, in the tradition of Dirt (and unlike New Zealand, which is a smack across the nose that lingers for days). If you really spray a lot into the air, you can just catch a hint of cannabis for about 2 seconds, then it is gone. I should have known better when I read Demeter's own website, where they described cannabis as a single plant where you use the stems for hemp and smoke the leaves. (sigh) I like the scent enough to continue to use this bottle, but won't be purchasing any more."
5,Its not too sweet,"Its just right for a winter pick me up. I feel like its spring, even though I'm stuck in an office in the dead of winter. I've gotten compliments frommany people about it, and it works really well with my ""mini pomander"" from L'Octaine."
1,Harsh,This has a very harsh smell and does not smell at all like violets. I was very disappointed with this purchase and do not recommend it.
2,Smells like licorice,"I thought this would smell like a sweet olive flower, but instead it smells like licorice. Great smell if you love the candy."
2,picture card review,"I purchased this picture card mainly to have more minutesin the movie mode on my Olympus 5.1 digital camera. Inthe movie mode, the play back is not smooth but in 1 secondintervals. I do not know why this card is giving me thistype of play back.I am not very happy.Don Heber"
5,POSSESSED WITH THE FACTS,"I conduct a lecture called ""Lessons Learned from Prince on Achieving and Maintaining Success in the Music Industry,"" and this book served as the basis for the bulk of my research. I can tell you unequivocally that the book's author, Alex Hahn, goes the extra mile in providing abundant, interesting, and accurate information from Prince's childhood, up until 2002. Compared to other unofficial biographies or websites such as Wikipedia, it's a far more in-depth and intimate accounting of the events and people that are woven into the life tapestry of arguably one of the greatest artists of our time. An absolute must have for all true Prince fans."
5,Price book good for the fan,This is a very interesting well written book. I seems to really go behind the scenes and see things like they were. The only thing that is bad at all is the print is super small. Wonderfully written.
4,kool book !!!!!,"im what you would call a diehard since 81' i've been a major supporter of prince and his lifestyle/music i have all the video's , books, cds, ect... and this is a great addition to the puzzle ....heres why you should buy it ....a book about an artist should reveal things we've never heard right ???????? well i got that on page 1 !!! i recommend this book. (where was it in 1988) ???"
3,Frustrating,"What's disappointing is that you don't find out what drove Prince during his creative peak, much less why he lost that spark/passion. What you do learn is that Prince appears to be a selfish, egotistical, ungrateful etc. person. That's driven home over and over again through this book, almost to the point of obsession.Since the author appeared to have great access to sources, it's unfortunate not to get better insights into the making of Prince's great songs."
4,A Look Inside Paisley Park,"Although I thought the author had an agenda, I thought this book was an excellent look at Prince. I've been a fan of Prince's since his first album and I thought Alex Hahn's understanding of the artist and descriptions of his music were right on target. It was interesting to see the breadth of Prince's work laid out in chronological order because it really brings to light just how prolific he was. Hahn captures Prince's bewilderment at the changing face of pop, the rise of hip hop and his place in it all. However, Hahn does sort of paint Prince as a little purple tyrant of sorts and from the extensive interviews Hahn did, it seems to be true. All in all, this was a very readable, engaging music bio."
3,Interesting,"Not too bad.Now it all makes sense about Prince to me.You give someone enough power and reign, don't think that they will give it up so easily. (I'm talking about the music making)He did it ALL, and wanted ALL the credit and control.Even though I'm sure his former band*Slaves contribute in assisting with the new music,but he didn't give credit were I believe credit was due to them.Good-not great book. But it answered some unanswered questions, and I believe they were the most accurate taking account from those who worked and dealt with Prince and both a professional and personal level"
3,I thought it could be better!,"Though the research is great, the writing isn't. There needed to be more editing on many parts of the book. The information is great but a lot of Prince die-hard fans(like me) already know his biography except for the later years. As for the later years of Prince I wanted more info especially in his marriages. I think the author was afraid to be labeled as a ""tabloid"" writer and didn't dwelve more into how his view of women and the lack of showing emotion hurt his 1st marriage. And some typos in the book as his older half(or step) brother Alfred and then his name is incorrectly turned into ""Albert"". Though there are fantastic reading moments in the book, also great research and marvelous insightful moments in Prince's life that many fans may have not known. However, it's an average to mediocre completion. It could had been done better and also I wish the pictures in the book were in color too!"
2,Why did he write this book if he doesn't even like the guy?,"It seems to me that the author is actually in the ""destroy Prince"" camp - he doesn't seem to understand much about the social surroundings of the 1980's, and takes the weaknesses of that era as Prince's personal faults. We belong to our places and are molded by our times. Prince as a voice of the people, as one who speaks for those who cannot - this did not come across at all in the book. All we see is what contracts were signed and who was mad at who. Although the book does have a lot of information, it doesn't have a soul."
1,Enquiring Minds Want to Know?,"This is a book full of tabloid journalism. Very few Prince associates were willing to go on record to tell their stories, but that doesn't slow Mr. Hahn down any at all.He proceeds to report rumor as fact, citing certain unnamed sources offering us a sensationalist view of Prince as an [odd one] who has sabatoged his own career and abused everyone he has encountered.If you believe everything you read in tabloids this book is for you. If you want to learn more about the real Prince, that's a book yet to be written."
2,hopelessly flawed and extremely boring,After reading Hahn's book-I had the distinct feeling that I had just read an extra long musical review that seemed only to touch gently on the surface of who Prince really is. It seemed that the author based his account solely on what others speculated and guessed. I found the book extremely repetitive and in some cases the other seems to have blindly wavered off the track of the story. The book in any case is not what I expected it to be and was very dull.
5,Feel the Presence of God!,"I was introduced to this book while receiving a yoga mantra. Little did my yoga guru know that by his casual mention of this book as a reference on the use of mantras that it would eventually result in my renouncing yoga and becoming a born again Christian. Anyone seeking God should try the ""Jesus Prayer"". It works. I am addicted. I truly believe that this prayer technique is all you will ever need to become one with God. Between ""The Way of a Pilgrim"" and ""The Bible"" you are set from a book standpoint."
5,Should be Six Stars!!,A great Christian masterpiece! Reading this book gives one appreciation and thanks for the Lord's grace and mercy. A wonderful guide to life - especially in this hectic modern society. Very mystical but also very practical following in the tradition of most Orthodox spiritual essays. Highly recommended to all Christians seeking a deeper understanding of taking up one's Cross.
5,Christian spirituality from the Orthodox tradition,"This is the story of an anonymous 19th-century Russian peasant who wanted to learn to ""pray without ceasing"" (I Thess. 5:17) and was introduced to the Jesus Prayer--the continuous repetition of ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner""--a practice that comes from the Eastern Orthodox Church and has its roots in the desert spirituality of early Christianity.I have found this book helpful and inspiring for both my Zen practice and my Christian practice. Incidentally, this is the book that Franny is reading in J. D. Salinger's novel ""Franny and Zooey"" (which I also recommend)."
3,Some problems,"There is nothing that can be said about a classic like this one. What does one say about Hamlet in an Amazon review.There are two minor problems with this translation. First, there is some terminology that is Western Catholic. The pilgrim for example uses a rosary and this is almost surely a prayer rope or chotki. Second, the Kindle version and the most recent print edition are inclusivized. Mangling the English language sets the reader on edge and creates the constant suspicion that something is lost. When the pilgrim says that Jesus loves people, this is really an obscured reference to the Divine Liturgy where Jesus Christ is referred to as the philanthropos or ""lover of man"". Did you know that there is a Russian proverb that goes ""humans propose but God disposes?""The Kindle conversion of this book lacks a Table of Contents but is otherwise usable.You might want to look at other translations."
4,Japanese Treasures: The Art of Netsuke Carving in the Toledo Museum of Art,"There are interesting stories about every netsuke, good quality of photographies."
5,I checked this book out at the library; would like to buy it,"I used this book for quite some time. I was very pleased with the results from this weight program. I have wanted to purchase my own copy, but have been unable to find it anywhere. Please let me know if it is ever available again."
5,Toshiba 1080 Bliss,"I went with this TV after a ton of research and it's high rating also by Consumer Reports. In my living room, one side is open with two six foot sliding glass doors to the deck, with a fireplace between. With plasma it would have been nothing but a glare fest because of the glass on a plasma screen. I was also was concerned about the black levels on LCD, NOT anymore. The blacks on this set are just as black, the color is WOW with no adjustments needed. I have it set up with HD DirecTV and the wow factor on 1080 stuff is high. For now I went with a upscaling DVD at 80 bucks with a HDMI output until the HDDVD/BlueRay prices come down, and I must say it looks great on this set. VERY glad I went with this!"
1,Nice mark up,Get them direct from north face for $22. Not sure why this camping store thinks they can charge more than twice the price for the exact same stakes!
4,Still a fine foundation for beginners,"Recently a heroic Palestinian MD, living in Romania, cited this book as inspirational to him as a young man. He has gone on to revolutionize emergency care and fast response as his life's work.While CPR has been taught to many civilians and newer hi tech gadget are available, this book still provides a starter course in good on-the-spot treatment."
2,"Good show, bad DVD.","I love this show, but the DVD I ordered through Amazon was defective. I ordered it used, and by the time I got around to watching the final two DVD's, and they were scratched and nearly unwatchable, the Return days had expired and it was too late to exchange it from the seller. Not happy about that. I'm not going to watch the entire Season in one week! I spread it out over a couple months. Now I'm stuck with this DVD set that is faulty and I can't even sell it used."
5,Good wholesome fun,"Good wholesome fun - If you're missing the good wholesome fun of television long ago, then you'll want to purchase this video series. The comedy and antics of this bunch of ""heroes"" is great. You won't regret your purchase."
5,Great show!,"Love this show, great DVD quality & what more needs to be said of show. Although this last season replaced Ivan Dixon. Get whole series."
4,Great Classic Commedy Series,"This is one of my favorite Classic Commedy series from the 1960s/early 70s.Probably seasons 2,3, and 4 were the best. They were hitting their stride in Season 2 and starting to wear a little thin towards the end of season 4. Season six is still fun to watch. If you just want a taste of the series, buy some of the earlier boxes first."
4,"Not much new, but a great pulling together of information","First, my gripe - people who are familiar with issues of radio and localism will find little new information here. I came to this book near the tail end of researching localism and LPFM in particular. There just wasn't that much here that wasn't available elsewhere.However, this is the first book that I know of that ties together various historical periods into a narrative of the rise and decline of localism in US radio. Having the information presented through this framework is useful.Also incredibly useful are the various appendices throughout the book, including legislation, FCC policy, and other documents relevant to the authors' concerns.I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone with interest in the decline of localism in US radio. For those already well versed, I might pass."
4,Shakespeare Songs...,"Overall, a good collection of songs that add 'flavour' to some of the works of the Immortal Bard (That's Shakespeare, to those of you among the un-initiated!). I would also recommend, ""Shakespears's Music"" or ""Elizabeth's Music"" for a good mix of Medieval/Renaissance music. My rating for this collect: 4 stars!"
2,A bit of a disappointment.,"The singing was very affected, a bit screechy and not melodic. I have heard better renditions. I will not be purchasing any more songs from this group."
4,Another good pot,"This is the fourth piece of the Multiclad line that we have purchased here at Amazon at greatly reduced prices.We really like the all-over even heating. This pot is very handy as we usually cook for 2or4 so it is just right for side dishes,sauces,reductions,etc. Plus it is dishwater safealthough I try to handwash each piece periodically with Cameo to shine it up."
1,the music page saves this game,"this game is just as bad as mario paint only with new features.their only using ""looney tunes"" to sell the game."
1,Garbage,"I like Jay Z and R. Kelly...and big fans of the both but do not get this if you are a fan of Jay or R's music, because this is nothing like either prior solo albums this is garbage 10 tracks of garbage and anyway (Best of both worlds?) maybe 4 mainstream but not to me the best of both worlds! Unfinished business,(this is business?) That's why they have beef now because it didn't sound right to either 1, this is the type of garbage that you would put in the refrigerator by mistake because you may have thought it was a stick of butter or maybe some can milk, or u may put it in some boiling water because you think it was some spaghetti noodles and forgot it was actually a Jay-Z R.Kelly cd, to put this in English DONT BUY!"
3,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I'm gonna have to say that I like the first Best of Both Worlds CD. The Black Album was a masterpiece, so this is kinda like Jordan coming back to play for the Wizards. The two songs that you hear on the radio are probably the two best songs off the CD. It was a big dissapointment. Just sounds like songs that were left off of the ""Best of Both Worlds"" CD and for good reason. I am as big of a Jay fan as anybody but this wasn't up to par. I guess the chemistry isn't there for him and R. Kelly. They make two great artists separately, but together it just amounts to ten tracks of mediocre music. Now Jay has to come back and give us a little something better because this CD can't be his last hurrah."
1,Unfinished Period,"Unfinished Business is exactly what the title states- Unfinished. I can't tell you how disappointed i was when i put this cd in and heard some of the same guitar lines and riffs and beats...my jaw dropped, and i double checked the Disc and my reciept to ensure that i did in fact get the right CD. A majority of the tracks on the album are remakes or updates of tracks from the original Best of Both Worlds disc, and of the few original songs on here, not many really catch my attention. Best of Both Worlds was a great cd, but Unfinished Business is nothing much more than a re-release of the best tracks from Best of Both Worlds with a couple of bonus tracks, one of which is a remix of one of the new songs. If you liked best of both worlds you'll like this, since thats basically what it is, the new songs are alright, nothing spectacular though. Not nearly what i expected."
3,decent CD,"Best of Both Worlds part 2. Hmm, I'm not sure I would call it that...BoBW was a brilliant mix of hip-hop and R&B; that brought us 13 tracks of all around good music.The duo's second release would fall nowhere near that category.It's 10 tracks plus one crap remix. Some of these songs were left out of BoBW because they knew the songs sucked. Luckily, theres 3 real good songs on the CD. Other than that, it's garbage."
2,You Have Got To Be Joking,"They call this a follow up??? if you like best of both worlds (the first album) then leave it in your cd player and don't waste your money on this so called follow up, it's weak, the ryhmes are cheesy to say the least! except for may 1 or two songs this album is a huge let down,i cannot get past the fact they spent almost two years putting this album together to come up with 10 songs and a remix which makes 11, i still believe jay-z and r. kelly are a great team but thier skills together are not shining on this album, it's almost if they had hoped to cash in on the hype off the album alone, save your money"
3,Unfinished Bussiness,"Top songs by the second album by Jigga and R.Kelly ""Return""""We got em home""-""She's commin home with me""-""Feelin you in stereo""-""Stop""-""Mo Money"" features Twista and is pretty good""Pretty Girls""-Break up thats all we do""-""Don't let me die""This album gets a lot better the later you get. I liked it towards the end better then your average hip hop album.Lyrics 8 Production 8 X Factor 6 Classic 7 Replay 6Total=6 out of 10 FingersTop 51.Dont let me die2.Stop3.Break ups that all we do4.Return5.Mo Money"
2,Weak Half-Hearted Effort,"It really is. This was a huge disappointment after BOBW, which was a classic collaboration for me. I guess the business is truly finished now. WHat a waste of collaborative talent"
2,very average,"I can't stand Jay Z, and his Generic Rapping kinda put me to sleep. R.kelly flows way Better than Jay Z.anyway this Album was very half-hearted though I dug ""Feeling you in stereo&Break up to Make Up."
1,No effort,"Since TP2.Com i've been wondering why r.kelly doesn't stop. He has the money his producing people well you know stop. There is nothing suprising about this album the same gituar and loop samples of r.kelly are back. actually the track pretty girls sounds exactly like is last collaboration with fat joe ""who that"". The same drums and tambourine keeps repeating in tracks like return and big chips. Of course jay z always does it's job but not even his lyrical metaphores and rhymes could save this record. R.Kelly is not a representation of what good r&b is anymore since TP2.com. The rest is just commercial (which some people might like)"
2,Wak !,"I am a Jay-z and R. Kelly fan. I believe they make great solo albums, but when they work together it takes away from both of their talents. Have you ever notice some people just mix well with other artist. I think if Kelly was to do an album with someone it should have been JaRule. JaRule sounds great on everybody else albums except his own. I have given the cd 2 stars. One full full star for 'Feelin You in Stero' and 1/2 star each for 'Return' and 'We Got Em Goin'. I say dont waste your money."
4,I like this one!,I'm not a big fan of R Kelly but I am of Jay Z and I think they did pretty good on this one. If you are looking for Jay z style of rap this isn't it but it's a smooth combination of r&b and rap (best of both worlds). I don't understand all the negative reviews but I like it. I think people that are 29 and up would enjoy this.
4,Feelin' you in stereo!!!,"This album was no doubt half-a**ed but ""Feelin' you in stereo""....got d***! That's one of the tightest songs I've heard in my life! I agree, they didn't care about the quality of this album they were simply out to make money. I mean out of 11 songs there are four remixes on this album, come on! They took no time whatsoever! R. Kelly(The greatest of all time) seems to be pulling a little more than Jay-Z, but both should have stepped up. It seems like Jay-Z never really raps like he usually does when he does an R. Kelly collaboration i.e. BOBW part 1. Seems like he just doesn't reach out for those jaw-dropping metaphors like he usually does. The great one(R. Kelly) does a little too much rapping on this CD and he doesn't shut the game down with his singing like he can. In my opinion this is better than the first collab' but still falls way short of the potential they have. Oh and did I mention ""Feelin' you in stereo"" is one of the tightest songs I've ever heard!!"
2,Unfinished Business by Jay-Z & R Kelly,"Are you kidding me? This is such a stupid attempt to make a quick dollar its dispicable. ""The Return"" & ""Big Chips"" have been playing on the radio for a minute, and with such low quality and horrible production I thought they were going to show up on some mixtapes or something, but then the album drops and they are on it? Guys with two men of your stature and power in this industry that was a horrible move. At least fork out the cash and do something genuine with it. And what is the deal with ""Stop""? Is that Foxy Brown or Shyne? Why is she trying to spit in this extremely low voice? I was not feeling that at all. With only 11 songs and only one of them being really good (""Don't Let me Die"") this is an extreme disappoint; possibly even worse then their original release Best of Both Worlds. Maybe these guys aren't as good together as they seem to think."
2,Business that could have stayed unfinished,"What happended here? All of these rap songs are elementary. How much time did it take to make this album? A couple of days? It's horrible. However, Big Chips is a great dance tune, but other then that, it's s***! Get real, this is truly business that should have been stayed unfinished.P.S. Jay-Z is making more albums! This one, and the one with Linkin Park. I think the retirement thing was a lie."
1,Jay-Z and R-Kelly only want to make a fast Dollar,"This CD is not worth buying. Rappers are getting away with making CD's that dont mean anything for a long time. It feels like the Rhymes were never drafted.These is typical of Jay-Z.This CD is the type of CD that you will listen to for a week, maybe a month and let someone barrow it and never ask for it again.These guys have no care for who buys there cds as long as they make a dollar, they dont care what they say or do. The CD was rushed with no thought put into it."
2,"Damn, Again","Once again,like Bush winning another term, this disappointed the hell out of me. Also like Bush winning again, this is no better than the first time around. I know, I know, this was recorded at the same time as the first but they coulda at least put some new verses or something kowing the last was wack. This is a insult to my listening pleasures! 2 songs that are salvagable are ""Don't Let Me Die"" and the ""Get This Money Remix"" with Twista. This is bad music that carries bad Karma. You see what happened with the tour. Jay and R. if you're reading this (or any of your people) do not do this again if it's gonna sound like this!"
2,"Damn, it should have been finished a while ago...","Disappointed. Cheated. Angry. Thats how I felt when I finally heard Jay-Z and R. Kelly's second ""Best of Both Worlds"" CD. Jay's rhymes was the worst I've heard him do in a LONG time, R. Kelly basically outsung the whole CD. It was sad, on top of that, it was just wayyy to commercial. It seemed like they put zero to little effort into it, and Jay even admitted that. I went to the Madison Square concert the night R. Kelly walked off stage, and it was one of the best concerts I've been to ever. I felt like I witnessed history, only because it showed how one performer (R. Kelly) really proved that he was at the bottom of his game, while the other (Jay-Z) pulled out his aces and performed a hit show, thanks to Mary J, Ja, and Busta! The CD is horrible though, get the Black Album instead, or wait and get Nas' ""Streets Disciple""."
2,Average,"This album isn't really effective in many ways. You can tell from the opening track ""THE RETURN"" that it is going to be a cheesy album. Most of the arrangement lack something that is character of Jay-Z arrangements as well as R-Kelly arrangements. The one arrangement that sounds R.Kellyish is ""FEELING YOU IN STEREO"", and it is rather boring and prolonged compared to traditional R.Kelly. On that specific track Jay-Z just isn't necessary. ""BIG CHIPS"" and ""PRETTY GIRLS"" are the two best tracks, and ""BIG CHIPS"" lacks within its arrangements. This album just seems rushed and mediocre all over. 2.5 stars. Average."
2,Best of Which Worlds?- They're both pop to me,"This cd scared me when I walked by it in the record store: a hologram that turned from R. Kelly's face to Jay-Z's stupid face. Otherwise, two guys back in 1989 named Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith, EPMD-in case you didn't know, dropped the first album with this title and it was a classic, which Kelly's and Jay's new album will never be. Jigga, I thought you were gonna retire? What are you waiting for? Please hang up the shoes immediately and move on to some other form of swindle, stay out of music! People, cop the real ""Unfinished Business""(EPMD) and pass by this pretty little collaboration from two prissy, pampered pop stars."
2,not even jay-z's final release,This album isn't even Jay-Z's final release (even tho the black album was supposed to be!!) he has signed to Deathrow to do another album as Shawn Carter...hopefully Dre can give him a good album
4,Let off some steam,"...by blowing up things! As a mature adult, I enjoy this game for easing my frustrations! It's easy to play and the graphics are lovely."
1,Not worth the money.....,"The costume arrived in a noodle box, the wand was bent, and the fabric was scratchy...not as cute as the one in the photo. Not happy....no refunds or exchanges....very sad...doesnt even rate 1 star...Don't waste your money on this product.."
4,Thomson Elite,"Well, typical Thomson quality here. It is exactly as I had expected.. light, strong, and precisely machined. I am one of the few people that have had issues with it sliding down here and there, but I'll figure it out. Perhaps if I get the Thomson post collar my problems will be solved, so for now I will assume that its my stock Cannondale collar causing the slippage.Other than that there isn't much to say here. If you are looking for an affordable high quality seatpost, stop looking and purchase this one. I purchased the setback, and don't really know if there is another brand comparable in setback posts for mountain biking."
3,Beautiful seatpost. Advertised weight is wrong.,"The Thompson Elite straight seatpost looks great, but the advertised weight is incorrect. I ordered the 30.9 367mm, and it weighs 246 grams when weighed on my Park Tool gram scale. This is only 20 grams lighter than the seatpost it is replacing. I may cut it shorter since I can get away with it, but for those who cannot cut it, this is not sub-200 grams as advertised."
1,The Thomson Elite Seatpost With Setback is Thoughtlessly Designed,"The Thomson Elite seatpost with setback is a poorly designed seatpost with zero forward angle tilt. It is obvious that all Thomson did to ""design"" this seatpost is kink an angle into the tube of the Thomson Elite seatpost without setback and then call it good. What the ""designers"" at Thomson failed to realize is that if you angle the tube back then you have also changed the angle possibilities of the ""infinitely"" adjustable seat clamp at the top of the tube. The major problem with this failed geometric design is that when the seat is tilted all the way forward it is parallel to the ground making a forward tilt past parallel a physical impossibility.Thomson missed the mark when they designed this seatpost. If you want a seatpost that has any forward tilt adjustability at all then this is not the seatpost for you."
3,Little more than okay,"This book is a very basic look at garden center management. If you are new to the business, it could provide a good introduction, however, if you are already running or working at a garden center, there is little in here you likely do not already know.Helpful hint: When this book was originally published, there was a printing error. My copy had a whole segment of pages which have been bound upside down. So if you buy this book, flip through and double check that all the pages are facing the right way up."
2,Hope the series gets better.,"More like 2.5 but... it's really hard to rate her books. I see promise and potential with this series, however, this story felt oddly similar to the first Lords book. And it was just... boring most of the time. I am looking forward to the Nymph King and Vampire King's books though."
2,Very boring read,For some reason could not get into the storyline or the characters. Too much stuff happening all over the place with no real relation between any of it. The characters are unbelieveable and the situations were so forced. The concept could have been good but somehow got all lost and boring. Read all 4 books in this series only because I got them all at one time. Will not be reading anymore Showalter's stuff.
4,Dragon Hot,"Heart of the Dragon was a wonderful read. I especially liked the way Showalter weaved the storyline of between the characters, mythology and present day. It kept me fully engaged to the very end. The sex was spicy without being over the top.I really enjoyed the Atlantis series. I bought the entire set of books so that I could read them in order and I can't wait for the next book to be released."
2,I liked her Lords of the Underworld Series Better,"This is a prequel to Jewel of Atlantis, although I think this book came after Jewel...regardless, Heart of the Dragon is the first I read. I was very impressed with the Lords of the Underworld series by the same author. Lords deals with mythology, and those characters have a depth, and the writing has many unique layers, with a hefty amount of romance...I figured this series might compare.It didn't for me...sort of fluff? Can I say that. Not sure how to put it into words, the book wasn't terrible, but certainly nothing unique. I will not continue with the rest of this series, but do look forward to her next installment of LOU in May 09."
1,Boring,"This was my first Showalter book and to me it read like a young adult book except for the sex. The dialog was juvenile (in my opinion) and I wasn't interested in either character. No depth. Darius came across as a grunting, snorting idiot who did nothing but give orders and threats. If there was supposed to be angst or guilt about what he felt he had to do, (I won't say what without giving what plot there was away) I couldn't feel it. Yawn. I had to force myself to finish the book."
3,A little disappointed,"I really looked forward to this series. So much so that I bought all three books. And while I did finish the first book and will read the next two, the first one left me a little...blah. I just didn't connect with the characters. I didn't understand what motivated them. Some things didn't make sense. I don't know. Maybe I was spoiled by the tormented warriors who were possesed by demons in her first series. I remember standing in the bookstore, reading the first page of the first book of that series and thinking, ""Oh yeah!""I'll give the next two a shot (might as well, I own them!) and hopefully can hop on and rave about them!"
3,too much like feehan,"First let me start by saying that I am a fan of Ms. Showalter. She is a solid author that is on her way to being a really good author in the fantasy/romance genre. That being said, she really borrowed a bit heavily from the world that Christine Feehan has already created for her Carpathians. Alpha hero is emotionally dead and cannot see in color until he meets his mate. They say magic words and are then joined together. Very sorry, but that is a bit too obvious. Still, the story was well crafted, a bit clunky in the pacing, but overall I have to say mostly enjoyable."
2,Like a XXX movie.,"If you like porn movies (constant sex and very little plot), you should enjoy this book. I am a romance fan. Graphic sex bores me. Usually, I skip over those passages and try to just read the parts that move the story along. I found that impossible here. I gave up about half way through. At that point we knew the heroine had a missing brother and the hero a missing friend. They hardly knew each other; yet could not keep thier hands off each other long enough to search for thier absent loved ones. If they did not care enough to solve the mystery and mount a rescue, niether did I.I won't be wasting my time with any more of this authors works."
4,Fast paced but ending felt abrupt,"I was pulled into the story immediately and followed the fast pace eagerly. It was quite entertaining until the end which seemed a bit abrupt, but it opened the door for more books and additional new character development, so I look forward to reading the next.All in all a good read."
3,Fantasy,The story is a great escape. Full of mythical creatures but showing love has no boundaries. I like the characters and storyline.
3,not her best work,I'd like to start off by saying I LOVE her LOTU series they are my favorite so I assumed this series would be fantastic. WRONG. It was just okay and I am so over the 20 - something heroine who is a virgin. PUUULEEEEZ why can't she be experienced? Who cares? They was no tension between Grace & Darius and I threw up in my mouth a little after they proclaim their love foe each other w/in few days. Gag!! She is extremely child like and bored me although I like how she was not emaciated thin. It seems to me Gena Showalter cut & pasted adjectives from other books which bothered me. No one talks like these two did & I realized its paranormal but it was even too much for fiction. Brother's story was distracting intwined w/ hers and a lot going on. It was just ok and hard to finish
2,like all her other books,It's just like all her other books.If ou like that sort of read then its great
3,Could have being better...,"The story in the overall is interesting. The sexy scenes were nice, but the book was warm. The characters were not great. The war wasn't really all that well written, and honestly I am not going to read the second book.The author brings the heroine to Amazon, but they speak Spanish in Brazil. What is a gross error for an author and a little bit of research would help.Then, she gives us a world, but there are not really engaging background for the romance. The heroine is just like must heroines, the hero I could swear I read about guys like him in too many books.I will give a shot on her other series. This one is not for me."
2,Boring conflict,"I read the description for this - dragons, vampires, Atlantis - and I was hooked into buying it. I'm sorry I did.The hero is a guardian of Atlantis; the heroine is a human wondering around trying to find her brother. She stumbles into Atlantis, meets the hero, love at first sight, but! He's got to kill her because she found out the secret that Atlantis exists.That's the conflict - he's got to do his duty and protect the secret. But I know that since it is a romance novel, he's not going to do it. The hero killing the heroine doesn't scream happy ending. The plot goes on and on, his dueling emotions drag out until I want to smack him. Then finally, three quarters the way through the book, he decides he can't do it. What a shocker, let me tell you.The worldbuilding, the setting, the imaginative story were all wonderful. The conflict between the hero and the heroine ruined all that."
2,I really tried to like this...,"...but I just couldn't. I got probably half-way through and couldn't take it anymore. I didn't feel any interest in the hero, and felt like his surly, anal-retentive temperament had been beaten over my head so many times without any redeemable qualities. The heroine sounded interesting at first, but quickly lost her appeal. Overall I felt it was a weak story with weak characters and nothing special going on.I see quite a few people enjoyed this book, but it didn't work for me. I've read many paranormal romances (Kresley Cole, G.A. Aiken, J.R. Ward, Jeaniene Frost, Larissa Ione) and one of Gena Showalters' LOTU series (so far) and have enjoyed all of them greatly for the most part, so I have a general understanding and appreciation for these books.This one, however, was a disappointment."
2,"Sounded great, didn't read that way","The first few chapters I was hooked, then things went south. The sub-story line is in-depth maybe too in-depth. Seeing how this is the first in the Atlantis series I didn't feel like it did a good job of explaining a whole lot. I understood the main characters (hero and heroine), but the rest of Atlantis was just a mish-mosh of total confusion. So many species were explained, it was confusing, and the Dragon guardian in the Mist (it was a little corny). Truefully the whole book was a little corny. I did like the heroine; in fact I liked her more then the Hero. She was realistic at least. Unfortunately the whole book was lacking in real substance and felt like it was thrown together. The descriptions were lacking in every detail. Its not a real show case for the writer, if you want to see her best work check out the Lords of the Underworld series ( now that's substance)."
5,Love her work,I love Gena Showalter's work and this book didn't disappoint me. I love the dragon world and am hoping that she continues with this storyline. There's still lots of dragons out there that need a little TLC!
2,"Little story, lots of sexy",If I wanted to read a story where the plot WAS sex--then this would have been the book. I wanted a story that would hold my interest--this didn't!
2,wasn't what i was expecting????,i love dragon stories... but this story felt flat. as another reviewer stated i guessed the whole plot before getting through the whole book. now don't get me wrong there are many stories in which i know whats going to happen next but i happily keep turning the page bc the story is just that good. but this one wasn't even close. i liked the atlantis premis and dragons being keepers of atlantis etc.. it was missing something.if you're looking for a really good dragon romance try g.a. aiken love her dragons.. you can sink your teeth into!!
2,PRETTY DARN BAD---,"It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that crammed together, but nothing was ever fleshed out to make it interesting. High on the corny side with a narrator whose fake southern accents were eye-rolling and annoying. A few days after suffering through it, I couldn't even remember what it was about."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is very informative, but the illustrations are a bit disappointing, and they should be in color."
4,TRANSFIGURATION DIET,THE SAMPLE CONSUMING SCHEDULES WERE GREAT F0R HELPING ME TO START EATING RIGHT FOR LIFE.
3,Great While It Lasted!,"While it lasted it was great! It toasted four regular size slices or two extra large/long slices easily. It even easily toasted bread that came straight out of the freezer. Just pop a frozen slice in, hit the 'frozen' button and you get gold crispy hot toast in minutes. The long slot is also great for people who make homemade bread in breadmakers, because it accomodates extra thick/extra long slices of bread. And the removable crumb tray makes it SO easy to clean compared to toasters whose crumb trays are not removable.BUT, just the other day, half of the heating coils sputtered and spat and must have shorted out because now they don't work anymore. It died after three years of normal use (used about 3 times per week) and now it gets to take up space in a landfill with all the other shoddily built appliances.I'd pay extra for a toaster that was built to last, if only I knew where to find such a toaster!"
3,Leggo Beast - Sines And Cymbals,"SINES AND CYMBALS, the second outing for Leggo Beast, definitely starts off on the right foot, with the religious meditation of ""New Deal,"" with its blues harmonica and gentle soothing tone. The more upbeat ""Smells Good"" and the ambient dub ""Kayenta"" continue this trend. And while there's a more pronounced dub feeling towards the middle of the album, with ""Noodle Soup"" and ""For Sergei"" leading the stoned revolution, the album towards the middle suffers from a common Pork-related complaint: the tracks don't do enough to distinguish themselves. Sure, they're nice to listen to, but nothing about them really draws your attention. The expanding, spacy sounds of ""Petite"" helps patch up this shortcoming, and the final track, ""5 Miles Out,"" seems to be an answer to the opening thought raised by ""New Deal."" Is it enough to save the album? Not quite. But it's still enough to make this album an interesting enough listen."
3,suspense,"Thriller, suspense and some romance. Not enough of the first two to make me love it. Good story just not great."
2,disappointed,this story just dragged and dragged and I ended up not finishing it. There was little or nothing to hold my interest for any length of time.
4,Action! Great plot!,"If you love a tough, smart heroine in a book with lots of action, you'll love A ""Touch of Magic."" M Ruth Myers certainly knows how to write both.Heroine Channing Stuart is not only a fourth generation stage magician, but also a world-travelling geologist. Don't you just love a heroine who has really unusual abilities?Although this book was written in the late 80s, it never felt dated. The terrorist plot was right on target for today's world, down to the inner workings of the minds of the terrorists, whose point of view we often see. (Interestingly, despite abhorring his plans, I found myself almost liking the main villain, which added a nice layer of texture.) I also found the world of the stage magician to be an unexpectedly fascinating one.I ended this book hoping that M Ruth Myers plans to write a sequel. Today's series-hungry readers would eat it up!"
4,magic & suspense,"I got this book as a freebie. I am glad I did. I love suspense., and finding out how much practice a magician has to do was eye opening! With a nice little bit of romance thrown in. Will love to read a sequel to this book."
4,Good read,"This is a good suspense story with belittle romance thrown in. Terrorism is at our back door, and this story begins light to that fact."
5,Riviting,Couldn't put it down. It grasped my attention from the beginning and kept it to the end. Would love to read more from this author
5,Great story!,"This is a really fun and energetic story. Action packed and fast paced, the story moves in a well crafted environment. The heroine is smart and talented. I enjoyed the ""magical"" backstory and the touch of romance. There are also a couple of interesting secondary characters that add humor and sentiment. An enjoyable and quick read."
2,Not My Favorite...,"I don't really know why I was bored by this book, but I was. The story didn't appeal to me for some reason. I was surprise because this is a pretty popular book for Rachel Gibson fans and I'm one of them. The hero and heroine had a love hate relationship that was annoying to me. They had a lot of history between them, but I still didn't feel the type of chemistry I was hoping for. I didn't particularly like the heroine and I thought the hero came off as a whiny wimp taking out his hatred for his daddy on the heroine, so it was kind of hard to root for them to get together. Not one of my favorite Rachel Gibson."
5,"Sexy, fun, Gibson at her best","This was the first novel by Rachel Gibson that I ever read and immediately became a huge Gibson fan. I decided to re-read it and it was almost as good as the first time.The characters are likable, sexy and fun. Back in high school they had crushes on each other, but due to a horrible misunderstanding, they both felt betrayed and burned by the other. It was interesting to hear/feel their old pain and see how the attraction over-ruled that in the end.Fun book -- LOVE Rachel Gibson."
1,I did not like this one...,"I have NO IDEA why this book has so many stars!! Now I love me some Rachel Gibson, I am always reading her books. Let me tell ya, Nick is the biggest dirtbag, man whore I have ever seen. He is disrespectful and tries to play victim throughout the whole book! Yes, he had a lousy childhood, but that's no call for the cold way he treats Delaney. Half way through the book I thought he flat out hated her. I thought they lusted for one another but they didn't like one another at all.This one is not even worth the read I will tell you that. Nick is not sexy to me. He has been with every woman in town, and abuses the one he really loves??? Gimme a break. Give me a break."
5,My first Rachel Gibson Book and Loved it!!!,"This is my very first Rachel Gibson book. I normally read suspense mystery like J.D. Robb, Sandra Brown and Dean Koontz. But it gets boring and the killing kinda gave me nightmares. The truly intense ones really gets to me at night. So my coworker recommended contemporary romance so I've been reading that ever since.I came across this author by accident to tell you the truth. But I am actually glad I did! I think I type in contemporary romance and Rachel Gibson's name popped up next to Jennifer Crusie and Erin McCarthy. I chosed her instead of the other two. I am glad I did. I won't give too much details as the other reviewer but this is a great first time read! I highly recommended this book to anyone looking for a hot, steamy, quick read! haha"
2,so-so,"I got this book after reading the reviews, but it wasn't what I expected. The writing was fine, but I didn't laugh at all, and ended up reading only the first 60 pages and the ending."
1,pathetic heroine,"rarely have i read a romance with such a weak heroine. somehow she turns to mush every time the hero tries to kiss her.she's a boring under-achiever and not worthy of being the subject of a whole novel.the hero is a domineering male who would work much better opposite a feisty lead than a dull pushover. also, there's no real reason given about why the hero even loves her, other than the fact that he used to be obsessed with her when they were kids."
4,"Dear ""Reader from California"" - You stole my review!","Well, having read ""Truly, Madly Yours"", I should have been warned about ""Simply Irresistible"": Both have a rather weak plot line and both have really two-faced characters. Honestly, Ms Gibson gets the love and sex and fun part right in both books, but in order to classify as an excellent romance, the hero and heroine should form a lasting relationship or at least a relationship the reader thinks will last. NEITHER BOOK FULFILLS THOSE REQUIREMENTS! Cause when you get to the bottom line, do you think Delaney and Nick will live HEA (happily ever after)? I don't. She's creative, spunky, a little weird and plainly not beautiful. He is though, but he's not creative, he's more mean than spunky and even though he lusts after her, they plainly don't have a lot to say to each other except when trading insults. Still hoping Ms Gibson works on relationship development plot line for the next book BUT KEEPS ALL THE OTHER GREAT ELEMENTS!"
3,Fun Book--costly,The process was fine. Got a fun book to read in a timely manner. Foud the same book at McKay's Used books for half the price and no shipping a week after I got it.
2,Disappointing compared to her first book,"I really wanted to like this book. I loved her first book, Simply Irresistible, and was excited to read this one too, but no joy. The heroine is whiny and unsympathetic and the leading man is an annoying cretin.Maybe it's because the things I liked about the first book are so notably absent here. This author really has an ear for convincing child characters, but you won't find one in this book. I like women who make their own way in the world and improve their lives, but this heroine was content to let her life control her. Rather than growing by facing up to some of the old problems from the home town she fled, the heroine falls back into the same old behaviors and never really changes. Any humor seemed to come at another character's expense. I'm sorry I bought it."
3,Gibson has written better books,"If you haven`t ready any books by Ms. Gibson, don`t start here. Try Sex, Lies and On-Line Dating or See Jane Score for a more interesting plot and well-developed characters. The lead love interests have potential in this book, but the constant vacillation between love and hate gets tiresome. This is an okay read, but not great romance."
2,No fuzzy wuzzy feeling Here!!,"(...)I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters are people that I would seek to avoid had I known them.Delaney is portrayed as small-minded, trashy, (...) and evil spirited. Nick is portrayed a little better. Throughout the entire book, all they did was trash each other. The intimate scenes seemed like they were randomly thrown in, and then immediately - they were back to trashing each other.There seemed to be no buildup of respect or understanding. This book left me feeling unsettled and uneasy and left me wondering how could anyone REALLY enjoy reading this.Maybe my standards are too high. (...)"
5,One GREAT GFX book!,"This is one great book! Picking it up and setting down in my usual lazy chair to read I quickly got a feel for how easy this book was to read. With beautiful pictures and easy to follow examples I quickly found it to be one of my favorite graphics books. This book covers almost everything you need to know about web animation, and best of all, it grows with you! As your skills get better the book explains more. From Gif89 animations to all out power house Flash animations that will make your site to die for! I loved every bit!"
5,The All-In-One Web Animation Guild,"Effective Web Animation by J.Scott Hamlin is definitively one of the best web animation books I've seen around. The book is clear, to the point and covers a broad range of topics ranging from simple basic designs to quite complex animations. Each page contains step by step full color illustrations, frames, source code, and tables making it easy for anyone to understand the concepts introduced throughout the book. One great aspect of this book is that it makes it possible for beginners and experts alike to learn web animation quickly and effectively.Effective Web Animation also contains a CD stuffed full of programs and samples for both Mac and PC platforms making it possible to start working immediately on your new web ideas. If I had to recommend a book on web animation to anyone it would definitively be this one.This book is your all in one tool enabling you to let that ""spirit of imagination in all of us"" shine through."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","This one is not worth the money at any price. It's only about 30 minutes long and the story is really lame even for 1999. My two sons, ages 8 and 10, kept waiting for ""something to happen"" and couldn't believe it when it was over. ""That's it??!!!"" they both said. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,THESE DON'T TASTE LIKE THE GUMMIES THAT I LOVE,THESE CANDIES TASTE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST GUMMIES THAT I HAVE HAD. I WOULD SUGGEST PURCHASING A SINGLE BAG BEFORE INVESTING IN A 12-BAG PACK.
4,de las mas divertidas de garces!,"una de mis favoritas de Mauricio Garces, me rio mucho con esta peli, si te gustan las pelis de Mauricio, totalmente recomendada"
1,not at all like the picture,"I will be returning this item. In the picture it appears that this necklace has very nice marcasite stones, but they are so tiny you can barely see them. Also, despite what the picture seems to show, there are only five stones. And the chain is just like those on gumball machine necklaces."
2,Beware,"If you have a Dell computer, you may have trouble playing, or downloading this set. Many Warner Brothers labels (Teldec, Erato, Warner Bros. Classics) have anti-piracy software that makes them incompatible with the disc drives that many Dell computers have. The music's great, if you can hear it through the background distortion."
2,Air plane history,"The book ( Air Force One )by von hardesty. talks about the transportation of the president of the United Status to fly abroad and the safety of this plane. The first president who used Air Force One is John F Kennedy and the last president to use it is Barack Obama. The airplane is Boeing model 747S. There are many types of entertainment in this plane like rooms, big menu for food, The white house is who takes care of this plane. The best part of this book for me is the history of the jet age. Maybe because the book is old. I expected more out of the book, Air Force One. I'm interested in this book because I love airplanes and my father has worked in Saudi Arabian Airlines, and now two of my brothers are working in Saudi Arabian Airlines as pilots."
5,Awesome Digging Tool,"I like this thing a lot. I have an old Oak tree in my courtyard and several times a year you can find me in my garden red-faced, covered from head to toe in dirt, cursing and pulling up the new trees and offshoot roots like a mad woman. The Hori Hori sure makes that work easier and more productive. Because of the design and small size, I can dig deeper and get more of the root system while cutting the crossover roots away at the same time. This year I was able to trace back and remove several of the offshoot roots that had produced trees at the other end of the yard in the past. It tears up less of the surrounding soil than the full-sized tools that I was using before and it is sturdy enough that it works great for removing the new trees that have grown from acorns as well. It was very easy to make shallow trenches for my DIG irrigation system with it, too. This is now my fist choice tool for planting and digging. Happy gardening!"
3,Not The Same Knife As Pictured,Knife seems pretty good. Bought it for setting Cinch Traps. I think the Tang Goes about 1/2 way back into the handle just past the second rivot.I cannot give 5 or even 4 stars because the item I received is not the item pictured. The pictured knife is a Greep Top stamped and the one I received is Nisaku. The blade is VERY Magnetic too so I don't see how it can be stainless steel. It is made in japan though. it looks like Amazon SKU B003UMVPMM (which also says stainless but I don't see how it can be). Going to contact amazon now since being stainless seems pretty important when it comes to this sort of tool. I could have bought another non stainless version for a lot less money.
3,Excelenlt for digging but....,"The tool comes very sharp so you have to be careful about not letting your hand slip. Kind of wish there was a shield between the handle and blade. Otherwise, excellent quality except for the sheath. The knife has cut through it. Need to improve the sheath because it will need to be repaired or replaced by a better one down the road. I subtracted a star because of the sheath."
5,Another Good product from Amazon!,"A friend recommended this knife to me and I had used hers for a while. I got my own and it is great. I have a lot of landscape material buried under years of dirt and mulch, and when I try to plant new flower/bushes, I get caught up in this old material. The Hori Hori knife made it an easy job to cut through that material and also pierce the ground to get a start for planting flowers. Amazon shipped fast, it was here in a day or two. I recommended this knife to my cousin and she also purchased one and has used it a lot. But be careful! It is sharp!!"
5,Hori Hori,"Becarefull theres different hori-hori`s out there. Be sure to buy the Joshua Roth Hori-Hori. I heard some brands the handle gives out, not sure which ones. But, I have a Joshua and really put it to the test when I had the blade way in ground and pry up with it and the handle did not even give, very sturdy. I pry up roots with it too. It saws through the small roots real good. Cuts moist ground like butter. Not too sure about hard ground yet havent had it that long and its still spring here. I guess anything you have would have harder time in harder ground. Buy it its awsome, good protection too if needed ;)"
5,a regular spade or trowel won't do...,...after you've used the hori hori.Dig weeds with a single slice. This is a great tool. Wish I'd found it decades ago.
2,Almost good,"The blade seems fine, quite sharp... The only problem is that the blade does not extend to the end of the handle - just about on third, which makes the handle prone to breaking. How much would it cost them to do things right?! +$3?"
3,Hori Hori knife,"I had thought that this knife would be useful in dividing plants. I have not found it to be so, however, because of the curvature."
5,whoopie,"sorry to say I don't have enough of Whoopies movies on my shelves. saw this one years ago and wanted it then but could never find it. thankfully Amazon had it and now I have my own copy. is a very good movie, one I will wat6ch over and over. ty Amazon"
2,Not as advertised,"I also received a mattress that did not have a recessed pump or repair kit, was not in ""like-new"" condition, and a ""manual"" that stated there was no warranty. I advised Amazon and they provided for return of that mattress and shipped a replacement. The replacement is exactly the same. I emailed them again and received this reply: ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."""
1,reconditioned areo bed,I'm not real happy with this product. We have used it two times and the air does not stay in it. The bed is deflated by morning.
4,"Very comfortable, great price","We've had our reconditioned Aerobed for a couple of weeks now and had the opportunity to use it twice so far. It was very comfortable and super easy to inflate and deflate. And the price was great! My only problems with it were the lack of any kind of warranty and no type of owner's manual. We hope that this will last us. Our last airbed was one we bought at Sam's Club two years ago for $38. It was only slept on a handful of times and then started to leak. We finally got rid of it and bought our Aerobed. So far, we've been pleased. Overall I would give this 4 stars."
2,"Green Politics from a ""Democrat"" green","I read this book a few years ago and have since learned who quite a number of the people mentioned in the book are. Many of the Greens Mr. Rensenbrink considered problematic were actually more faithful memebers of a true alternative party than Mr. Rensenbrink has turned out to be. Mr. Rensenbrink turned out to be one of the architects of denying Ralph Nader the Green Party nomination in 2004, which resulted in an intentially weak Green Party candidate that would be no challenge to John Kerry. As a result the Green Party is weak and barely a blip on the radar. What a shame for those that had great hopes for the Green Party and what a disservice to Ralph Nader who wrote the forward to this book. If the Green Party does recover it will have to be in spite of ""Democrat"" greens like Mr. Rensenbrink."
4,Great Louis L'Amour stories,"This is a collection of four good paperback books from Louis L'Amour: Fling, Hondo, Utah Blaine, and The Californios. A great collection if you Like L'Amour stories."
2,Not up to par with L'Amour's first works,"This cover isn't very interesting; the portrait format that is becoming so common in L'Amour reprints really makes me not want to look at them. I would strongly encourage L'Amour fans to check out the early editions of Bendigo Schafter and Catlow, western art at its truest form. Recent reprints of these two books exhibit art that proves their literatur content has decreased as well. Save your money for yard sales."
4,teaches morality,These are good stories for moms and dads attempting to teach their children moral lessons without being too sappy about it.
5,The Best TV Western ever made,"I can't emphasize how wonderful these stories were done by a great acting crew who made you feel like you were in the old west and on a trail drive experiencing all these incidents that crossed their paths. The acting is incredible by Eric Fleming and the whole crew. The stories are presented in black and white, but it doesn't matter because the quality of the stories are classics. These stories take me back to when television was a pleasure to watch and quality stories were shown. Louie Lamour would be proud of these writers who wrote these stories. What is so amazing about Rawhide is that it draws you in to feeling that you are really there with the drovers and are caught up in the stories. In my opinion the Rawhide series was the greatest western series ever produced for television, when television was worth watching. If you can't buy the DVD series then rent it if you can. You won't be sorry."
3,"oh, no. please don't go to the volumes.","This show is a classic, and the Season 1 DVD was great. The second season however has not been given as much care. The cheaper packaging and volume 1 only release makes me think the first did not sell very well and Paramount was not willing to throw more money at the franchise if it did not show continuing interest. So if you are a western fan or Clint Eastwood fan, go out and buy this to show the studio that there is a market and they will continue to release the future installments of Clint and the Gang."
1,No Suckers in this Household,"Is Paramount so hard up for income that they have sunk to ripping off the consumer by dividing the season into 2 volumes? I concur with the other reviewers of this 2nd season set. This is one of my all time favorite TV series, but I won't stand for highway robbery and will wait until Paramount realizes that treating the consumer fairly is as important, if not more so, than making a ""quick"" buck! Either put the series out unedited in the complete 2nd season format or forget it! You won't see any of my money for half a season sets!"
1,Release full seasons please!,"I agree that the season should be released complete instead of in installments, I would buy it in a heartbeat if they did."
2,I Agree,I agree. I will also not purchase volume sets when I expect to buy the entire season at the same competitive price as Season 1
1,hell bent for money,"as others have stated, this is definitely price gouging on the part of paramount home video. i, too, will be boycotting this season two package.gil favor would have been awfully displeased with what paramount is doing to his cattle drive."
1,What a disappointment,"I only buy complete seasons, with few exceptions. This isn't one of them. I'll just wait until they get it right. What a shame."
1,I HOPE YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION,I'm very sad to have to take part in the same boycott as the other members. My family and I have been waiting a long time for season two and we watch season one constantly. We will wait or catch old reruns on TV until the studio gets the message.You know what would be nice when they finally decide to put all of the season together? Spanish subtitiles! People who speak Spanish love to watch Rawhide and similar videos.
5,"RAWHIDE The Second Season, Vol. 1 - Is Worth the money","While I understand those that feel like 30 bucks per half a season is a bit pricey, (I do too) I still think some shows like RAWHIDE are worth the money. There is nothing on TV anymore to compare to the good ol' shows of yesteryear. I will buy every season released of RAWHIDE, RIFLEMAN and HAVE GUN-WILL TRAVEL, just to mention a few favorites. Like one reviewer said earlier, it's not that expensive per episode. However, hopefully the prices will come down some as we continue to show our support of these great old shows."
2,TX O&G 1543-1943,"This is one of the very few books that covers this particular subject, and it does so very comprehensively--up to a point. That said, it was written long ago, and it contains no information concerning events that have happened since the reader (or prospective purchaser) was born. I don't doubt that the stories herein are accurate enough, but please don't buy this book thinking that it is going to be a ""good read."" It's not. It's dull and dry, and the author was a nice guy who was an amateur writer at best. A fair portion of the book is dedicated to tables of oil and gas production numbers for old fields than ran dry decades ago. Think of this as a reference book that is only to be consulted occasionally when some obscure fact or statistic is required."
3,It's ok,This is an ok cd. Definetly not what I expected from him. This is not to be compared with Selah. Not like it at all. His songs are ok. The album is rocky so if your into that kind of stuff you will like it. His vocals are powerful as usual.
1,PC Poison,"I first came across Ms. Barber's work in a short story my son brought home in a third-grade textbook. Boys were stereotyped as sexist, demeaning, and hostile. I found a copy of this book: more of the same.While Ms. Barber should be free to publish whatever she wishes to, parents should also be free to keep their eight-year old's from the cross-fire of the feminist gender wars. Ms. Barber puts them right in the middle, slicing through the ego's of young boys with the hostility and malice she attributes to them in her writing.Boys are more than seven times likely to commit suicide than girls. They're less likely to graduate high school, college, or graduate school. They're much more likely to end up drug addicts or prisoners. Ms. Barber's sexist writings -- falsely portrayed as an affirmative message -- might not be the sole cause of the problem, but they sure don't help.This book, and Ms. Barber's other writing, is inappropriate for children. Especially boys."
4,Easy interpretation,Easily portable and great for up-to-date interpretation of the Bible. Print is a little small but suits my need.
3,Bible,"As a former fan of KJV version I have switched to this version. Very readable, in everyday language. This particular printing however has an occasional washed out print, still readable, but sub-standard. Mostly good quality."
5,You need this,"I bought a pair of these and my computer stepped into a new dimension of sound. I made a couple of collaborative recordings with some of my music playing friends using Garage Band and then Logic and Emailed them to the other guys involved, but they weren't very impressed with the work. Then they came to my place and i played it back through these monitors and they were astounded. they are pure and honest and have plenty of muscle. Now we all have them set up. It is a crucial element in any recording/music appreciation setting to have honest reproduction of sound. I'm not going to bore you with specific details - these little guys simply rock. You need them. Buy them. Unless of course your studio is freakin huge and you need monster sound, then go up a size."
3,fuelling around,"the soft metal castings , i found to be very fragile, themodel is loaded with detail , and it fits in with my service track , overall it's worth the time to build ,good looking when finished ,just takes a little time to get great results,,,leon"
5,Refreshing Toner,"I use this as part of the complete Elemis system of skin care that includes a cleanser, exfoliate scrub, moisturizer and mask, etc, It smells nice and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not dry or tight. Recommended."
3,it's alright,"i started using elemis in jan 2012 and i used the facewash and toner, i had real bad acne beforehand, and it went away after using the product about 2 weeks, but now it's back :("
2,Received damaged,Who ships a plastic bottle in a bubble envelope? I received this item and the bottle is cracked and the envelope was damp from product leaking out. Why anyone would ship a plastic bottle in a bubble envelope is beyond me. I would like it replaced!
2,Let down by the casting,"This new release of Wagner's early success is sorely let down by some of the singers. Jane Eaglen is extremely disappointing as Senta. She sings with little or no imagination (fatal for the role of Senta). She is often unsteady and tentative in her high register while her lowest notes lack resonance. Struckmann is a smooth-sounding but too weakly characterised Dutchman. Holl lacks to strength of tone of Daland and Seiffert is just a mediocre Erik.Barenboim and the orchestra, on the other hand, give a masterful performance. Indeed, I have nothing to complain about the orchestral playing as well as the interpretation, which are extremely fine. But it's so unfortunate that the recording company has failed to find more suitable singers to match such a fine achievement.A great pity indeed."
3,Not the revised version!,"As I write this, none of the other reviewers did comment on the fact that this is a recording of the original version of Holländer. The so called ""redemption motive"" is missing in the end of the overture as well as in the very end of the opera. This is OK, since the original version is still the preferred one at Bayreuth. But this should have been made clear in the product description. I was expecting the revised version."
2,"Better luck next time, Mr. Barenboim","Recently, I had a chance to hear Barenboim's ""Fliegende Hollander"". I was utterly disappointed. The orchestra & choir were good and the conducting was spot on, but the vocal cast is devastatingly flawed. Jane Eaglen sounds too heavy as Senta, and Felicity Palmer didn't sound too great as Mary, Senta's nurse. Falk Struckmann as the Dutchman tries very hard, but fails when he's supposed to be lyrical during his arias. I was, however, impressed by the singings of Holl and Sieffert.In conclusion, I think you should avoid this rendition of Wagner's first successful opera. And avoid James Levine's rendition, too. Go for the Sinopoli, Solti, or Klemperer recordings."
2,Disappoints,"After hearing Barenboim's marvelous recording of Tannhauser, I decided to get this Flying Dutchman. It is a great disappointment. I am no expert on opera and am not able to write with sufficient clarity on all the deficiencies, but one thing really stood out: Jane Eaglen's Senta. The quality of her voice really does not suit the youthful Senta. On the hight notes she sounds more like screeching rather than singing. I don't understand how someone who sounds just fine and even great on Tannhauser can sound so horrible here."
5,Great Recording / Lousy Service,"This boxed set is terrific. Barenboim has the Staatskapelle Berlin sounding like an orchestra possessed--you'll never hear a better rendition of the overture. The singers are all in fine form.My sole complaint--and its a big one--is that my boxed set was seriously crushed before it ever left amazon's warehouse. The back part of the jewel case was seriously crushed. Really lousy customer service, if you ask me. But the discs were playable, so I didn't return it."
1,Algebra Made Simple,The book was not intended for a beginning student. It was a teachers aide. I couldn't remember definitions of some words and there was no glossary. Very disappointing.
3,good but faceless,"Barbara Frittoli is an exasperating performer. Her's is a beautiful midweight lyric soprano, excellently controlled and even throughout it's range -- in short, an ideal voice for Mozart. Unfortunately Frittoli seems disinterested throughout much of this recital. Instead of digging in and giving these vocal masterpieces the heart and fire they deserve, Frittoli seems content to simply sing them well but ambiguously. Occassionally her singing catches fire as in ""Mi tradi"" and ""Come scoglio"", but when an aria as emotional charged as ""D'oreste d'ajace"" fails to ignite even minutely, something is very wrong. Vocally she seems tired, the top often lacking the floated quailty it usually has -- might the recent string of Trovatore ""Leonoras"" have something to do with this. Frittoli is a talented singer, hopefully she records another opera recital that better displays what she has to offer than this correct but boring disc."
3,She ain't heavy...or is she?,"I am by no means an expert on classical singing, although it makes up a good 75% of what I listen to. For references, I prefer Renee Fleming to most any soprano out there, Cecilia Bartoli to Jennifer Larmore, Domingo to Pavarotti (Domingo being the better actor) etc. Frittoli to me has a voice better suited to Verdi than Mozart. It is a heavier sound than those I customarily associate with Mozart, but then, as I said, I'm no authority. Let's just say that I prefer the Mozart albums of Dessay or Fleming or even Kathleen Battle to this. Frittoli's bottom notes seem forced, her tone patchy at times. The top is lovely, but all in all seems not well-matched to the material. I look forward to her Verdi album to see if I'm not right -- at least in my own mind!"
2,A real disappointment!,"All the other books of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant rate from good to excellent, except this one! It is wandering disjointed morass of bizarre places and people. The story switches from the main character to the viewpoints of other characters throughout this whole book. Thomas Covenant is rarely heard from in this book. He is just some body everyone else drags around. The whole book is pointless! Nothing of real consequence happens until the next book WHITE GOLD WIELDER.If you want to read the whole second trilogy, do yourself a favor and make sure you get this one used or from a library. You won't want to keep it."
3,"Never trust a man who uses ""uxorious"" in casual conversation","The first time I read this book, it was a trial to get through. Of course, I was 16 at the time. I recently re-read it and enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. The main problem I would cite is that it seems too episodic, as if the many things that happen to the giantship are unrelated and just serve to fill the book up as much as possible. Linden is the focus of this story, as she is most of the second Trilogy, so don't wait for Covenant to get into the action. He spends a good portion of the book out of it."
5,A great series,"This entire series is incredibly good. Donaldson portrays the heart of his hero with understanding, compassion, and candor. His Hero, except for tenacity, is very flawed, but his very flaws make him the person he is. A great series worth reading by anyone who appreciates psychology, religion and adventure.Leon"
4,Superb performance - excellent voices,"This performance claims to be ""legendary"", and while I'm not so sure about that part, I was nevertheless extremely impressed with the performance. The orchestral accompaniment is close and intimate, consisting of only 2 violins, a cello, a double bass and a chamber organ. Sebastian Hennig's treble voice is simply sublime and his skill and control excellent, while Rene Jacobs has a very strong counter-tenor voice well suited to this piece. The only criticism was that on some tracks the vocals were too loud compared to the orchestral parts, although this is highly subjective and depends on your speakers as well. Highly recommended."
4,"A good, decent cup","The coffee that my Senseo coffee machine made never got beyond tasting plasticy and metallic, even though I rinsed the unit as directed when I first got it, and followed all procedures. I had to give up on it and get a Cuisinart, which I love. However, the flavor that emerged from these Kona pods, as far as I could tell (beyond the mask of the plastic), was rich and good. Not smooth, because nothing tasted smooth with the Senseo, but as flavorful as I could get. To use a cliché, I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bath water. If your Senseo works and doesn't make coffee that tastes metallic or plasticy, you might really love this coffee. I thought it had real potential, and I don't blame the coffeemakers for what the machine did to the product."
4,"good for camping, travelling","The small ""pods"" are wrapped in foil, so you can throw them into a backpack! Tastes pretty good for ""camping"" coffee! ha ha!"
3,Surprisingly lackluster,"The authors know their stuff, and I'd thoroughly recommend what I've read of their individual scholarly work. However, having just plowed through this book in a seminary class, I'd have to say there's something peculiarly dull and lifeless about it. The main theological themes seem adequately covered, and the authors go to pains to highlight the diversity of theological approaches canonized in the Old Testament. But despite many inherently interesting topics, the writing is stiff.One other critique: despite acknowledging the centrality of the exilic experience to the formation of the canon, the author's choose to devote relatively little space to the related literature. As a result, the book seems to hurry to its close.Overall, this book is certainly adequate to it task, it's just not inspired or inspiring."
3,ok,"Have not yet finished it but seems a bit dry, may get into it later. it was required reading for a class."
3,Reference,"The book is an exellent text for reference material for someone studying the history of the OT. I ordered the book for a class, but later found out that I did not need the class. For background and research, the book is excellent."
4,This books works!,This book is great. it helped me express myself as i had always wanted.Reading this book not only spiced my relationship up but amazed my boyfriend. It helped me overcome my fear of sounding stupid and made me feel confident!
3,Older women,"I'm 20 and was looking for a book to teach me to talk sexy, maybe more seductively. Like all self-help books, this one is all about boosting your confidence. This book suggests you write in a notebook/journal as you read it. Maybe it would help. This book is designed for 35+ year old woman who have never used a sexually explicit word in her entire life. Not the book for me, but maybe for you."
4,You WILL Talk Sexy After Reading This Book,This book takes you through a detailed step-by-step process to learn how to talk sexy. After reading this anyone can do it no matter how much they may feel uncomfortable or think they can't.
1,Talk Sexy to the One You Love,"Well, reviewed the sample on Kindle and it looked pretty good, but the book itself is just exercise after exercise. May work well for some but not what I judged the book would be based on the sample. Sort of a warning to all, reading the sample first 20 or so pages on Kindle does NOT define the remainder of the book. I would NOT have purchased this if I had been able to review the whole book (as in a brick and mortar Barnes and Noble, for example). I got burned on this one."
5,Nice stand. Accepts 3/4 inch arms,I used this one for my own subkick style mic. I needed a stand that would accept a tom which used a 3/4 arm. This one worked great. It seems to be nicely made and not at all flimsy.
2,I can't stand Lily Bart.,"I realize that we're supposed to sympathize with Lily Bart, the protagonist...but I just find it impossible to really feel sorry for her situation. Other reviewers have claimed that ""Lily had no choice"" but to end her life. Well, I think that's completely incorrect. She has numerous possibilities to marry Selden--a kind, decent man (in contrast to repulsive ones like Rosedale) who adores her, but she cannot give up the riches of the upper crust in order to do so. Essentially--and this Lily admits to us at points during the book--she's in it for the cash, even if she does finally understand the opportunities she's wasted throughout (strange, for a woman who talks nonstop about ""opportunities..."") And I think that, even if it's a correct reflection of the time in which she lived, Lily's motives ultimately destroys my sympathy for her as a character. I mean, a woman who complains because she can't have fresh flowers on the luncheon table every day? Come ON, Lily..."
4,"Lily, Lily","Amazing heroine. Frivolous as a hen Lily Briscoe stands alone in the whole history of literature. Intelligent, witty, incredibly beatiful she doesn't get what she deserves because wuthin she is a Good person. ???No morals and no ethics, just an internal force that acts straight and totally uncontrolled.It's always a pleasure to read and it will always be."
2,Not Henry James Lite,"Serious readers of Victorian/Gilded Age fiction, in particular those experienced in groping through the Master's obscure passages, will not find this book a refreshing alternative. Lily's fall is too predictable and melodramatic. All the other characters are wooden, especially Selden, who is like a handsome but untalented actor mouting empty lines. The author's treatment of Simon Rosedale makes me want to urinate on every book she ever wrote. Wharton's ugly anti-Semitism stands in sharp contrast to the clearer thinking of her great contemporaries: Conrad, James, Twain, Howells, George Eliot, Willa Cather, and many more. Additionally, the perseverating description and obsession with material doodads--while pretending, of course, to condemn poor grasping Lily--is no better than any shopping-and-whoopee grocery-store paperback's. This second-rate talent deserves instant oblivion."
2,Must be one of the author's early (weaker) works,"In this novel, the protagonist's decline and fall seems as obvious and predictable as that of a Greek tragedy. Despite the author's ironic commentary, which is not as sophisticated in this book as in some of her other novels, the reader is left wondering just what is wrong with Lily Bart and her unmerited, overweening pride? Plot slows down to a crawl about half-way through, despite the engaging & entertaining glimpses into high society at the time Wharton was writing, and finally gets absolutely predictable. Still, worth a read if you're just discovering Wharton. Characters relatively interesting, if somewhat mawkish. Continue with her better books, however, like CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY, ETHAN FROME, and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. 2* instead of 3* because of predictable ending."
4,Edith Wharton is a master at bringing you into her world,"The House of Mirth is a wonderful novel describing New York Society at the turn of the century. Lily Bart is a socialite on the lookout for a rich husband. She is beautiful and feels that that is all she has or needs to offer. Her ending is predictably sad, but nonetheless you wish otherwise. Wharton is a master at describing the society of her time. The characters are very vivid, you can almost feel that you know them. Great book."
4,I read it on my own -- and got through the whole thing!,"If you like old, fairly antiquated tales of turn-of-the-century aristocracy, then this book will please you. It is in fact extrememly well written, and causes us to feel for the main character. While I for one had a certain sense from the begiining that Lizzy Bart was doomed, that didn't stop me from feeling pained as I watched her try to save herself again and again. I recommend it! Not quite as tedious as ""The Age of Innocence."""
5,A saga of the Victorian age to rival Shakespeare,"Lily has everything a woman would want--beauty, clothes, taste, and suitors. She has everything but money. And that makes all the difference. And the inevitable is happening. She is getting older every day. I became her in a way. I could relate to each of her reverses, could understand most of her reasonings. I was entrenched in her character and pushing her to please marry Selden--they so obviously loved each other! And yet Selden was weak. He could have reached out and did not. She spiralled downward and her friends watched disinterestedly--or perhaps just enough to provide some gossip about Lily. The final scene will tear your heart. It is the finest book I have read in a long time, no matter that it is nearly a century old. It speaks to the woman's heart today as it did then. It is a book I must have in my library forever."
1,Do not buy this kindle version,"Edith Wharton's prose is, of course, exquisite, but don't buy this digital version. The formatting has no table of contents and there is no indication of where one chapter ends and the other begins (with occasional page numbers in the middle of words)."
4,A Tragic upbringing,"What is more intriguing in the novel is not only how the protagonist was a product of her society's objectification of women, but how she was brought up to be that way. Wharton exposes not only the frivolous society of her time, she exposes the tragedy of women who were raise without any sense of self-preservation and self-reliance. Lily Bart cannot live in a world deprived of opulence, and must be mercenary to attain what she desires most. Wharton's work is perceived as lengthy at times; however What the reader must realize throughout the story is that Wharton was alluding against her own society's upbringing of women."
2,Seriously Misleading,"Despite its title, this must be one of the least funny books I've ever read. I only got to page 32, realised that it was seriously deficient in laughs, flicked to the end, and found that it ends in much the same vein. I hope that if Wharton ever decides to reissue this book, she'll consider changing the title."
3,"Heart of Fools, The Lily Bart Story","Someone once told me that readers like to read books where he or she can relate to the main character(s). I could not relate to Lily Bart's character. To me, it was written not as a book of leisurely reading,but as a book of lessons. The author, Edith Wharton, was demonstrating the evils of greed and that those who seek wealth are willing to give up their own morals to get it. The lessons given in the book were my only enjoyment. This is why I gave this literary piece a three. If I had spare time on my hands to read a book, it would not be this one. Thank you."
2,no pity for Lily Bart,"I was looking forward to reading this book for a long time, but found it totally lame. Why, exactly, am I supposed to identify or sympathize with Lily? I found her greedy and stupid and totally lacking in self control or basic common sense. I admit a century has passed between her life and mine, but her problems remind me of my contemporaries who have no money because they *spend* too much money. How is that heroic?Ironically, as she's whining about being relegated to second-tier society circles, she describes them as painters and actors and a crowd with a lot more character than her high society friends. Sounds like victory rather than chrisis, but Lily finds it dreadfully ""dingy"". Boo Hoo. Get a grip Lily, millions of people live without money. Ultimately, it's not all that tragic."
3,Definitely not an upbeat tale,"I can't classify this book- not comedy, mystery, or romance like may Victorian tales. It's more a look into society in the 1900s and how social standing is everything. Girls in high society were raised with few skills, and the main character, Lily had one gift- she was pretty, when her money was gone she was able to live off her friends - for a while, until her poverty became obvious. Then she became a social leper, her friends avoided her as if they might catch what she had. What she didn't have was the skills to earn a living- this story traces the character's descent from being a ""must invite"" to the gentry's parties to drug addicted poverty. I found Lily to be frivolous and not always likable- she depended on her looks to support her in the lifestyle she aspired to and scoffed at many opportunities that could have prevented her downfall. Still, it is a book worth reading and closer to the reality of what life was like in those years."
2,Lost in the middle!,"I readily became engaged with the characters. However it soon felt as though I was on a treadmill. As a result, after several tries, I stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through. BORING!"
4,The House of Mirth,"Lily Bart is beautiful, but by the standards of her era, she is not young. She is honorable, but she is not good. She is devoted to luxury and dissipation. She is ""so evidently the victim of the civilization that produced her, that the links of her bracelet seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate.""Lily, the presumptive heiress of Mrs. Peniston, the wealthy aunt with whom she lives, enjoys playing cards for money, a vice that leads her to accumulate a debt she cannot pay. The debt puts her in the power of a dishonorable acquaintance and places her on a Dantesque journey downward through the social levels of wealthy New York pleasure seekers during the late 19th century.Lily has feelings for Selden, a bachelor lawyer, but does he have them for her? And can he save Lily from the fate that awaits her at the end of her declining trajectory? These are the questions that maintain suspense during this entertaining cautionary tale."
4,A Crucial Study in Women's Literature,"This was the 2nd book I had to read in women's writing. The book does drag at times, and this is not the drum I march to. But in all honesty, this is a crucial study in women's writing. In no other book that I have read (even in the women's writing class) has the specific pains and tribulations women are subject to displayed so tragic and yet beautifully. Lily (the protagonist) is in a painfully realistic situation. She is victimizied by several people who represent different aspects of society. Even around her own mother she is not safe. Lily's own mother sees Lily's beauty as a measure of wealth to be invested. If I was writing a paper and could only use one book to represent American Women's Writing, chances are this would be it."
3,Cirquitous Verbage,The storyline was good but the reader has to go in circles to keep up with the story.Weuse far fewer words in modern times to get to the point.
1,Lifestyle of Rich and not Famous,I had read only one other of Edith Warton's books - Age of Innocence. I enjoyed it very much. It moved much faster envnthough it was of the same time period. Lilly Bart is somewhat of a 'scatterbrain' and I am tiring of the book and I am at Chapter 13. Hope it ends soon.
5,study guide,"This book is preparing for a huge test, it is very easy to read, Im sure I will do just fine, thanks so much for this book."
3,Good idea,"It's a good idea to have all of his books in one. However, this is a large book and there are no questions."
5,Grilling 101!,"This is a perfect book for someone learning to cook on the grill. My girlfriend NEVER cooks, and is pretty lost in the kitchen. With all the pictures in this book you cannot go wrong. I purchased this book as a surprize for her from Amazon. The day she received it she made me a wonderful dinner on the grill. Every recipe has a step by step pictorial. As a seasoned cook i can't wait to try some of the recipes that have intimidated me before....like making perfect ribs. 100% satisfied!!!!"
4,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book if you are not a grilling pro and want to learn details that would help you, this perfect. I did some grilling before I found this book, well it was O.K., but after I have learn a couple of thing that have help me a lot.It also has a lot of references to websites that are grilling related. There is a section about sauces that is pretty good too. I hope everybody enjoy the book as much as I have enjoyed."
3,"Good, but poor digital version","The content is excelent, very useful and is explained in a very simple way. I bet that this book should be awesome In Hard cover or Paperback, but since I bought it for my Ipad, I only give it three stars. Publishers need to understand that a digital book doesn't mean to scan a book and upload it (that's what it seems like). I could give this Kindle book 5 stars, but my reading experience was screwed up."
2,Good techniques. Not so good recipes.,"I was very excited about this book coming out. The layout and photographs are really nice (full color) and the techniques great (although *BEWARE* it didn't really teach me anything I hadn't learned from the Barbeque Bible already.) But in the end, the recipes left me disappointed as I was hoping for something more sophisticated. My advice, don't buy this book if you already have the first one. And don't buy this book unless you like all your meat products stuffed with cheese."
3,Beware 18 inch grill owners! Adapt or die!,"This a a great book for creative grill masters. One caveat: if you own an 18 inch weber kettle, be sure to adapt the coal amounts for your smaller grill. Otherwise you will fry your food faster than a hyper-active pyro. The author never bothers to mention how much fuel to use for various sizes of charcoal grills. Not once in the entire book. So, be carefull grill-jockeys and adjust down or up as needed. Otherwise, yum."
5,"Not just best grill book, the best COOK BOOK","This is not only the best book on grilling I have ever used, it is the easiest to use cookbook on the planet, bar none. The recipes are unbelievable. I served the London Broil last night at dinner, and my friends all agreed it was the best beef they had ever tasted. Ever grill a cabbage? This book will show you how. I used to think I knew how to barbecue until I started using this book. Every procedure is clearly documented with outstanding step by step photographs. This book is a groundbreaker!"
4,How To Grill,The book is chock full of recipes. I actually wanted to learn how to start a grill and keep it going. I passed it on to a deserving couple.
4,How To Grill,This has been very helpful for my husband who does not cook - not even in the kitchen. Hopefully this will inspire him
3,"Good, But there is a lot of repeative infomation","Some good recipes and ideas how to improve your favorites.However a lot of the recipes have the whole process of lighting the grill, and prepping the grill. I think this could be covered in one section of the book and not every recipe."
3,Nothing new here,"This is solid piece of work, but is a rehash of some of Raichlen's earlier work and numerous others. I love grilling and have several books on the subject. I picked this one up because I'd enjoyed his earlier books and thought I might pick up something new, I was sadly disappointed. It's not a bad book and if you don't have any other grilling books this is decent start, although personally I'd recommend The Thrill of the Grill by Schlessinger & Willoughby."
2,A waste of time unless you like repetition and odd dishes,"Raichlen is all about fluff. Can there be ANY good reason to start every recipe wasting a page on how to light your grill and oil it? The recipes are nothing to write home about, in fact they rarely have anything to do with grilling as they could be prepared with any cooking appliance. I believe Raichlen's main goal is to prove a grill can be used too cook anything, like say playing 'Duelin' Banjos' on an electric organ. This is a big book - 500 pages. It should really be about 130. Does it have any saving graces? sure. There's a nice 2-page spread on the different cuts of steak. That's it. As an owner of this and many other grilling cookbooks I would not recommend it. My #1 recommended book is the Weber Real Grilling book. THAT is the book for anyone with a grill, gas or otherwise. It explains things without redundancy, has crafty recipes, and gives decisive directions. It's also crammed full, not a lot of fluff like all of Raichlen's work."
5,Great book,This is one of the best cookbooks that I own. I bought it because we bought a smoker and wanted some help with that. This book covers everything that you wanted to know about grilling.
4,If you are a rank amateur...,"This is the first book I bought about real barbecue. I had never smoked a thing before and this book made it easy for me. It is clearly laid out, and the recipes, at least the ones I wanted, were easy to use. I since have found different and better ways to do some of the things this book covers, but I don't know that I'd be there without this book. So, I can recommend this book highly to anyone just starting out with barbecue."
1,The index,"this book was horrible, most of the index was missing the top half of its pages. it was not ripped so it was manufactured that way and they still sent it to me."
3,"Great, but who has time?","Ok, maybe I am wrong, but who has time to sit and read or locate anything in this book. I wish he could condense the books he has written a little bit. Once again, I bought this for my hubby in hopes of some amazing ribs, but it just scared him away. Would he have to go out and buy a whole new gril?"
3,good stuff but repetitive,"Not a lot of variety, and the book would be half the size if he didn't include the same grilling info over and over, His Bible was GREAT! It seems now like he is just cashing in."
5,My favorite!,I have loved every single recipe I have used in this book. I just bought the hardback version because I used several of the recipes in the paperback version so many times that the book fell apart!!! Definitely try the Asian style ribs - even better on pork chops & let them marinate for 48 hrs. if you have the time!!!
4,The Man Bible,This cookbook is the man Bible in our house. We've had it for about ten years and then this year I gave it to my 22 year old son and my brother -in- law. They love it. It has grilling recipes for just about everything and loads of tips that are very useful and creative.
4,Useful and clear,"Haven't had a chance to try too many recipes yet, but I've read through the book and it's great--good information, very clear photographs illustrating steps. I like that the emphasis is on useful information and that it is geared to both charcoal and gas grills."
3,"Great Recipes, Bad Binding","The recipes and illustrations in this book are terrific. Every one a hit. Raichlen shares recipes and techniques for grilling from all over the world. As a cookbook, this is one of my favorites.Unfortunately, the publisher didn't take the same care in assembling the book. This is a thick paperback, and the spine lacks adequate reinforcement. Within a few uses, pages were falling out. I now have a rubber band around it to keep it intact. Pity there isn't a hard-cover version."
4,Hubby Loves this book.,Bought this book from my hubby. His loves to grill now that he knows how to better. Yummy he is becoming an awesome cook.Great for me because he likes to cook more now . This means less cooking for me. Yeah.
5,great book,My husband has one of these and we love the recipies so got one for my son-in-law as a gift for him.
4,Grilling!,Good book for some instructions on grilling. Bought this for my husband and he enjoyed it . Great pictures of items were taken throughout the book.
4,"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe","I didn't think I'd be able to find this since it's so old, but I was pleasantly surprised! This was actually a gift for my 24 year old son who had always loved this animated feature."
4,"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe","It is remarkable to see this version of the classic tale on DVD. Despite the obvious poor quality of the original production of this animation, the story comes through as good as the new movie displayed. Do not expect high graphics with this purchase but for those of us with children not old enough to see the latest movie release (PG-13), this animation of a trulely great story is worth the price."
3,help,i cant find any info on this edition.is this the animated version by Bill Melendez? is it the BBC version? is it something else? help!
1,The worst addaption of the LWW in the world,"This movie is horribble! I loathed it. This movie is a horrible addaption of the book and I think it is way, way, way too cartoony. I absoulutly loathed, hated, and despised this movie. And if I could I wouldn't even give it 1 star. I'd probally give it 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 of a star..."
4,Good but buy the cheaper version,"I have always loved the animated version since I was a wee tot. However instead of buying this one at 24.99 (or whatever the price is now) there is a new printing that is more like 10 dollars. The movie itself is the same on either version. The dvd for this one claimed to be 5 mintues longer, but I checked and that wasn't the case. The cheaper version has better extras too. This one only has a few trailers for some other products while the cheaper one actually has information on Lewis and the various books. Its not a huge amount of extras, but better then just some trailers. The only thing I did like better on the more pricey version is the presentation. The cover looks better, the menues looke better, etc. Not a huge deal though, more of a personal preference. So look for the other verion, amazon sells it too."
3,This IS the Bill Melendez / 1979 version!,"In case you're confused by the conspicious lack of information provided (not only in the listing here but on the DVD packaging itself), this IS the 1979 Bill Melendez Studios (of Peanuts fame) version, which I haven't seen since it originally aired in two-parts on prime time television back in '79!The transfer here isn't great but is watchable (its comparable in quality to the DVD of ""The Last Unicorn."")If you're looking forward to reliving 70's TV memories or just want a respectable rendition of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe to tide you over until Disney's ""Chronicles of Narnia"" DVD hits stores, you can't lose with this release."
3,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (Animated)","When I was 5-8 years old, this animated ""epic"" tale absolutely mesmerized me. I read the entire series of Narnia books when I was young. I felt a little nostalgic and bought The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from Amazon.com. I am in my 30s now, and although I enjoyed it, I didn't realize how crude the animation was. Also, I remembered it to be almost 2 hours instead of the actual 90-95 minute length it turned out to be.Not a bad trip down memory lane. I suggest renting it."
5,Animation Edition,"If this is for the animated edition I watched when I was a kid, it is excellent. I loved watching it over and over. I like to order it so I can have a copy to share with my kids."
5,Really cool,"I haven't actually seen the movie yet of course, but seeing the trailer assures me that the movie is in good hands. WETA, the small company developed by Peter Jackson, is handling the creatures, weapons, and other such things. From what I've seen, it seems this movie will be at least as good as(and possibly better than), Lord of the Rings. I just had to be the first of the surely many reviewers. YES! YES! YES! ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST WEB SHOPS IN THE WORLD I'M THE FIRST TO REVIEW PROBABLY ONE OF THE HOTTEST MOVIES IN THE WORLD!! Overall, this movie is awesome. Watch it and buy it when its ready."
1,This isn't the Emmy Award winning title...it's the other cheaper version...,I don't think that this is the Emmy Award version - look at the graphics on the cover (cheesy!). The Emmy Award winnning version is actually cheaper than this one!
5,"Ahhh, the memories!","I love this dvd, but only because I grew up watching it on VHS so it brings back a lot of great memories.If you're looking for a 21st century quality cartoon, don't pick this one..."
5,The Lion the witch and the wardrobe,My opion this is the only version for young children. My children loved it and watched it over and over and now my grandchild is doing the same.
4,A very good adaptation from book to animation film,"Somehow I missed this film when I was little but am having a chance to see it now with my daughter.It is a very good adaptation from the book and seems to capture the essence of the book even better than the more recent elaborately produced Disney version. It focuses more on the rest of the story and less on big budget battle scenes, which I am getting so bored with in fantasy movies. At first I was startled by how primitive the animation was. It was distracting but after a while I simply didn't notice because I was engrossed in the tale."
5,MORE THAN JUST A FAIRYTALE........,"An all-time family classic! ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" together with ""The Flight Of The Dragons"" ranks among my favorite animations of all time. I remember watching this film as it was aired on a local network, and eversince falling in love with it. I always wanted a copy of the video since I was a kid. I lost track of this movie for ages, and luckily was able to get hold of a good copy in a recent garage sale in our village. The tale of the adventure of ""The Sons of Adam and The Daughters of Eve"" together with Aslan againts the White Witch is simply thrilling and magnificent. The story of faith, emotion, love, inspiration and magic is brought to life by this sterling creation of fantasy."
5,ONE of my favorite animated movies!,"Like other reviewers i remember seeing this as a kid and parts of the movie stay vivid with you. ONe of the best absolutely best animated movie of all times. the music is beautiful. yes the animation is outdated but in my opinion this is better then disney movies being made today. and i didn't realize actually it was a religious movie until years later. that doesnt change a thing. i love this movie and could watch it many times. i had the tape,loaned it to a friend and didn't get it back. that wil teach me! recommend this to everyone! this is a movie for young and old."
3,Tucker in name only,"This is NOT a Barbara Tucker CD -- and I have been waiting for one since 1992 -- but it IS a selection of her favorite club cuts, mixed by two Ibiza DJs, Samir Maslo and Pufo. Maslo gets the prize, for including an actual Barbara Tucker song, ""Get On Up,"" in his garage-y set. Pufo's set sounds like Italian beach disco: appropriate for an island locus like Ibiza, but docked one notch for not serving up even one song by huse music's most exciting 1990s diva."
1,Too many models... too few pages,"My advice is to save your money and buy the Chilton's. Better yet try to find used versions of the original single model year Chilton's or Motor's Manuals that were sold to professionals for the specific year(s) you require. A major problem I see with this book is trying to cover too many model years in too few pages. If you have a 1981 to 1988 Cutlass you definitley want to look elsewhere. Chapter 13 is titled ""Revisions and information on later models"", which means everything from 1981 to 1988, a total of 38 pages of which 4 pages are specifications and 18 are full page electrical schematics of ""Typical later model"" items, of which most are of no value. Unless you just want a book to use as filler on your automotive shelf this book won't be of much value. Just one man's opinion."
2,Manual - ok quick referance but incomplete details,"Manual is good in some areas like engine maintenance, but lacking details in most others. Example: 7 lines of information on how to remove and install rear stabilizer bar. Just to many years to cover in one book."
2,Blah,"I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I'm sure I will one day, when I'm at the gym on the stepper trying to push myself and the pain is such that only way I can relieve it is by try to focus the intensity of my workout on how dreary this book is."
5,Men of the Bible,"I usually do not read religious books, but, this one was very good. It was told in an easy way to understand and enlighten you. When I finished I actually wanted more."
4,Interesting facts about various men of the Bible,"I'm enjoying reading about these men. Told in everyday language and condensed into short chapters make for easy reading. The good, bad and sometimes ugly facts are presented."
3,Men of the Bible,I chose this rating because of the emphasis on how God uses ordinary men. God can use any one to do His will only if we listen to Him
4,D.L. Moody - Excellent Book,I know who the author is but didn't know of any books he'd written. It's an easy read and very good. You won't be dissappointed!
3,Solid book,Draws out points well but still somewhat lacking in depth. Pulled upon an extensive array of Bible narratives in a cohesive manner.
3,Men of the Bible,This book was only about 7 men of the Bible. I enjoyed the story about Abraham and his nephew Lot.You learn about Isaiah and Moses. But it wasn't a broad historical overview of figures found in the Bible.
5,A Great Book!,This book was given to my one year old as a gift & she LOVES it! She looks at it all the time & has learned a great deal from it. She is currently 18mos. old & continues to enjoy the book. I have purchased multiple copies to give as gifts to friends. My only complaint is that the pages are paper rather than cardboard so the pages rip easily.
5,A Fabulous Start!,"They state that this book is good for ages 4-8. However, my 15 month old child absolutely adores it. She points to pictures and attempts saying the words."
4,"A book for toddlers, too!","This book has captured the attention of my child since he was 12 months. He's now 18 months and we look at it daily. It has helped him acquire new vocabulary and he especially enjoys making the noises of the animals in the book. Angela Wilke's ""First ABC Book"" is equally enjoyable, but with less objects. The one negative aspect of this book is that plastic figurines are often substituted for the real thing in the photos. I would prefer a real photo of a horse than a plastic figure or drawing."
5,Great,My 3 years old love this book. I got this book for her to read while we were potty training. It keeped her busy
2,a bit complicated for a toddler,I was very excited to get this book. The intended use was to help my 1 year old start to label the world around. The problem with this book is it is just too much! easily 20 words on a page of just categorical words. ie. clothing: underware shirt pants skirt dress socks slippers gloves straw hat coat undershirt pajamas tights polo shirt jeans shoes.... thats page one. I was just hoping for something a little more simplistic for my baby to get excited about.
5,A great book for your baby!,"My one year old daughter loves these books! She is pointing at all the pictures after I ask her where an item is. She can turn the pages at her own pace, point, and I tell her what it is, and she remembers after that. It's amazing. It's also great for those family members who are not comfortable reading out loud to children. We are working our way towards owning the whole collection."
5,A great starter dictionary,"This series of board books are fantastic.I started collecting these for my daughter after she was given one at 6 months and this is what we started to read to her every night. She woud sit and demand it to be read over and over and over again. The board pages and are easy for baby and toddler to turn and the pictures (real photography not illustrations) are wonderful.The word book has a little bit of everything - like a mini dictionary - of things that baby will come accross in their daily life - clothes, food, utensils. My toddler can now read and say the names of each thing herself while pointing to them. It has helped her give names (and learn to say things by us reading the book over and over) to things in her world.If your looking for a great picture book to share with your baby this is the one (and the series of books) to buy. You can never have too many books to read with your children."
5,Excellent! we love DK books!,"Again, we love this book! It's almost as much fun as the Animal Book that DK published. The photos are so wonderful and they are all of things that a toddler recognizes.Being a board book, too, helps! Our son loves to look at and occasionally gnaw on his books. Luckily, these are tough enough to take both his reading and chewing.I'm glad that we discovered DK Publishing and want to buy all of their board books for our son."
5,the book is as nice as the movies;,"I have seen the three movies based on this novel quite a number of times but i had never actually read it and I'm happy to have ordered it. The story is meant for children but i enjoy it as much as my children, it is an easy read for children who study English as a second language . I chose this edition because i want it to last ; I already have three grand-children and i know it's goiing to be a favourite."
4,Interesting,"Interesting as social commentary. The characters are easy to believe, the plot barely believable but still interesting, if somewhat moralistic."
1,Little Lord Fauntleroy,I ordered this audio CD because I like childrens' classic literature and because I like to listen to audio books while on trips. When this audio CD arrived I was disappointed because on the cover it said MP3 CD. I do not have an MP3 player and have not been able to listen to the CD in the car like I planned. This product was advertised as an audiobook without mention of MP3 on your website.
2,Poor Printing,"The company's service was good, but the book itself was full of printing errors. A large speech was absent at the end, and I caught that only because I'd looked it up; the ending made no sense without it. There was also computer code on the pages here and there in the middle of text. I definitely don't recommend this publisher's version of the book."
4,Little Lord Fauntleroy,"Very well written. Do not remember hearing about this book while growing up, and saw that it was on the top 100 classic books. Entertaining."
5,a delightful read,my goodness this is one of the best books ive read....which i am a BIG fan of fhb and have liked everything i have read written by her...this has to be one of my favorites....great story great meaning to the story!!! please read!!!
1,I agree with Cheap Print Job,"Not only is it a flimsy book with no illustrations (when the illustrations are quite important to the story), but my copy was missing a page, right before the end. My copy goes straight from ""his mother on one side and the Earl on t"" then, new paragraph (skipping 263 words and a whole charming scene where little Cedric thanks everyone), it continues ""hand into the Earl's and stood close to him.""Don't waste your money on this ""Print on Demand"" edition; get a good used copy instead."
4,Great Book,This is a book for all ages. It is a bit of a slow start but then an enjoyable read with a good moral.
5,Cuisinart Skillet set,"Great quality!!!Food does not stick. Nice weight, not too heavy or too light, just right."
2,Unhappy,"Not as good as said in the description,very uneven heating,slight overheating can spoil the pans.I am already looking for new pans.Quite unsatisfactory"
2,Not really usefull,"The person who buys this book thinks it is good for ALL Suzuki Swifts.......that's not true. I own a Suzuki Swift Gti 1.3 4 cylinder DOHC, and this book tells almost NOTHING about it, just some references here and there, it may be good for a 1.0 liter, 3 cylinder Swift (although I doubt it)....money thrown to the waste basket!"
1,Not worth it,"Really, I was very excited when I got the book, after trying repair my car few times, I notice the book was good for nothing. As an example I can tell that not even the position of timing belt marks on the gears are explained.Don't waste your money, I will send mine free if you pay shipping costs."
5,Great for little infants.,"I bought this due to the only infant size available. My daughter is 6 months old and is small for her age due to being a preemie. The helmet fits perfect on her and we feel safe taking her for a bike ride on our bikes. I am a strong advocate for bike helmet safety, my niece was hit by a car and her helmet saved her life."
5,great helmet,"Great helmet for my 10 month old boy. I bought the yellow one b/c it was the brightest, hoping it would be the most visible for my little evil kinevil. His sister has the toddler Giro in the princess pink and she's been wearing it for two years with no problems. GREAT helmet!"
2,Not a Fan,"We bought this helmet for our 14-month old. First of all, the helmet is too heavy for an infant. The visor is far too long and after a few minutes on, the helmet falls over his eyes (because of the weight), despite the dial adjustment. The worst issue is with the back of the helmet. It's so thick and bulky and at his current height, the bottom of the helmet 'latches' on to the back of his bike seat, rendering him completely unable to move his head! We've had to place a thick padding on the back of his seat so that the helmet doesn't come into contact with the bike seat at all. We're moving on to a Nutcase and will revisit this one when the baby becomes a toddler."
5,Great Helmet!,I'm very happy with this helmet. I bought it for my 14 month old and it a good helmet for the price. It's adjustable in the back which is great for growing kids. Very cute design. In the beginning baby girl didn't really want to wear it but now at 17mo she asks to put it on. Highly recommended.
4,better helmet for 16 month old child,My son did not like the helmet we bought at Target which stuck out at the back near the neck preventing him from keeping his head upright during bike rides and causing him to cry. This helmet provided a flat surface so he could keep his head upright and he now enjoys bike rides in the carrier.
3,Bike helmet for babies,It was really hard to find a helmet that would fit my son's head. He is 19 months and this helmet is the only one I could find that would come close to fitting. It is still a little big and the straps are kind of confusing to me. I think it will fit him better as he grows. But it works and is confortable on his head. He hates wearing hats or anything on his head and this doesn't bother him at all.
5,Toddler Helmet,"This is adorable. Rated #2 in safety in tests. (Chose this one because the #1 helmet, the Bell Boomerang, has a long part in the back so the child can't put their head back in a high seat.) Not sure if it's meant to be a ""girl"" helmet, but I got the yellow chicks one for my 20-month-old son, and it doesn't look girly (just wasn't as crazy about the blue or red). Seems safe and easy to adjust (LOVE the back wind-thing to adjust tightness-it's super easy). Overall I am very happy with this helmet, I had originally purchased one from Target (forget the brand) and it didn't seem half as safe and nice as this one. Would definitely recommend."
4,very pleased,Our little girl is petite and extremely active. It was tough to find a bike helmet that would adjust properly. This one is terrific.
4,grandson has put it on 6 months cold out,grandson hasn't put it on yet waiting for the summers and training him young start now make it easier later
5,Infant Helmet,I am happy with this infant helmet and have no trouble getting 18 month old to wear it. It took a little to get it adjusted onlybecause an 18 month old isn't very patient. She loves wearing it with the pink bunnies on it. I feel the price was very good andI feel that she is protected from injury.
4,life saver!,"this was the only infant helmet i could find anywhere and i hate buying things over 10 dollars if i cant touch and handle it first but i really wanted to work out with my lil one, but this helmet met all my expectations i was afraid it would be too big but it fit perfectly and has room to grow with the adjustments available, my daughter is 10 months and is in the 50% on head circumfrence, at first she kept trying to take it off but after getting on the bike she left it alone, but i would recommend fitting the helmet a day prior to riding bcuz if it upsets the baby with taking it on and off tend to one they are going to be grumpy with the ride!the only reason i did not give it five stars is because i have only had it a day n a half and dont know if it will last as far as quality but SO FAR it seems to be EXCELLENT quality time will tell even more"
5,Perfect Helmet for your Little One,Nothing bad at all to say about this helmet. If you are on the fence...get this. It's got the nice knob feature that you can use to snug it down around your little one's head. Once our little guy got used to having a helmet on his head he was fine...doesn't mind it at all! Would offer great protection too! Let's hope he doesn't need it!!
3,Baby's bike helmet,we had some difficulties sizing this to our 1 fr old's head. The stick 'ems that came with the product kept coming off. So I glued them and now the helmet fits great and the baby wears it comfortable every time we ride. I would recommend this product.
4,Helmet is great,This helmet is great for younger children. It fits my one year old really well. He does put up a little fuss when we put it on him but he'll get use to wearing it eventually and he will love being able to ride along when mommy and daddy go for bike rides.
3,Cute but frustrating,"I've had to make ""fixes"" to the inside shell of this helmet since the velcro isn't strong enough to hold the shell on the inside. Needs a little more design work done to make sure the helmet stays on the with the inside shell if it does happen to hit something."
3,too big for my baby,"too big for my baby. my baby is 13 months old and the helmet is to big for her, even in the smallest way it can get.so it falles on her face and eyes, and she doesnt like it. also- I guess its not safe that way!"
5,easy to adjust,the straps took a little bit of time to line up correct on my super squirmy 1 year old but you can't beat the easy tighten option.
3,"Good helmet, but had to re-glue cushion",This was a good cheap helmet but had to re-glue the inside headstrap over time...it did what it was supposed to do and that is to protect our daughter during biking.
3,Not so thrilled anymore,"Loved it for the first two months of use. Cute, adjustable chin straps and head circumference adjuster. I made it a point to keep it safe- hung on a hook in garage, avoided leaving it sitting in the sun and heat when not in use, never let it hit the ground. However after about two months of use the interior adjustable strap came off- unglued and now doesn't stay as snug. My son is 22 months now, he loves the bike, doesn't mind the helmet...I need to buy another as I no longer feel it's a safe fit. Bummer, I was expecting to use it foe a few seasons"
4,Nice Helmet,"I purchased this helmet for my 14-month old son. I like that the helmet is fairly flat in the back. However, we still need to put a small folded blanket behind his back in the bike trailer to accomdate for the helmet. It is easy to adjust however since my son's head is still a little small for it we put one of his baby washcloths inside the helmet at his forehead to makeup for the extra space so that it doesn't slip down over his eyes. I would recommend this helmet for a baby - but if your baby had a small head you may want to see if you can find a smaller helmet."
4,All-in-all a great buy!,I like this helmet since it does not stick out as far in the back as other helmets. My 13-month-old son has a hard time drinking his water (tilting his head back)but a lot of that is due to the trailer. I like that the helmet will grow with him. I really wasn't sure how to size it with the pads provided. There were no instructions on how the helmet should fit him (maybe that is self explanatory but I'm one of those that would like/need instructions to be sure I'm doing it correctly). All-in-all a great buy!
2,seemed nice but fell apart in a few days,"at first the helmet seemed just right, ...the tightening mechanism seems perfect to get a snug fit. but within a few days the helmet was wabbling all over my 16 month olds' head, even though the halo was tightened to her size. it seems that this internal ring is only attached to the helmet by velcro, unlike the adult version which i really like. so... the helmet is down over her yes, and my daughter is moving it all around as we ride. no longer comfortable or a good fit. too bad! we are going to try a simpler style helmet instead and i hope it works out."
3,Doesn't necessarilly fit 48-52cm as stated,We were unable to use this helmet. It states it fits heads 48-52cm. My son's head is 50cm (as measured both by our well baby visit a month ago and my own measurement before ordering). The only adjustment is front to back. The sides are too narrow for his head. It looks like a nice helmet but I have to return it since it does not fit. instead of more such guesswork we are going to an actual bike shop tomorrow to try them on in person and get a good fit. I might suggest you do the same instead of relying on the stated size range.
1,Fell apart after couple of uses,"After couple of uses, the black plastic strap fell off.Upon close examination, they are attached to the helmet by couple of sticky pads.I've uploaded the resulting image so please take a look before purchasing this item.[...]Update 7/29:Returned the Giro and purchased a ""Bell Toddler Sprout Bike Helmet"". Verified that the horizontal black strap is embedded into the helmet, and not attached using sticky pads like the Giro. I highly recommend taking a look at the Bell instead. It's also few dollars cheaper."
4,"Looks good, fits great.","We used a similar helmet when we rented one at the beach with our bikes. The adjustable wheel guarantees a good fit that will grow with your child. We looked at local stores and they were significantly more than online. It looks good, fits great and is a good price. Very happy with this purchase."
1,Should be recalled,"This helmet is very cheaply made. The mechanism that fastens the helmet to the child's head is attached to the helmet by velcro. The velcro that is used to attach the helmet to the straps consists of round velcro stickers about the size of a nickel. My 19 month old daughter was able to rip the helmet off while we were riding. This item should be recalled because if a little girl can rip the fastening mechanism off the helmet; the helmet would most likely fall off with any substantial impact, leaving the child unprotected. Do not buy this helmet! Next time around, I will make sure to inspect the helmet at a store before buying online."
3,Some things good... some things not so sure.,"In short, the head measurements seem accurate by the manufacturer. However, the adjustment straps seem somewhat cumbersome, and lacks clear directions. The chin straps seem twisted as they come from the helmet past the ears into the adjuster (lack of detail in the instructions does not help). Lastly, the additional foam inserts with adhesive fell out on their own just sitting idle in the garage."
5,Great helmet!,This helmet is great. My daughter is 20 months and has a small head. I have found it very easy to adjust. Much better than what I had for my older daughter. It fits her head perfect and does not tip forward like most helmets tend to do. Easy to put on...my 9 yr old daughter put it on her the first time. She also does not mind wearing it at all but is was a battle to convince her to wear it the first time.
5,Smallest Helmet,"Quite simply, this is the only helmet I could find to fit my 7.5 month old son.Does what it's supposed to and the adjustment knob at the back is easy to use, even when in place on the head for extra snugness."
1,Falls apart,"Helmet seems to have a good system to adjust the helmet size; unfortunately, after a mere 4 months of usage, the foam sleeve with which the adjustment ring is fastened to the helmet fell apart (it is flimsy). As a consequence, the adjustment ring floats around in the helmet, and the helmet can no longer be adjusted -- and can no longer be used."
3,"Okay, but not as great as I expected","The product itself is pretty nice. I like that you can size it easily. However, it gets stuck on the back of the bike seat and falls down over her eyes. Also, because it gets stuck on the back of the bike seat, the straps chaff her neck. I think it will work better for when she is a little bit older (she just turned 1) and taller than the back of the bike seat."
3,Too large for an infant,It's a nice helmet but advertising it as an infant helmet is a little misleading. My son is 6 month sold and he is big for his age. This helmet doesn't fit his head and it doesn't look like it will for a while. It should probably say ages 1 and up instead of infant. It will work well when he gets older though.
2,Not pleased,"We bought this helmet for our 10 month old who rides in the kiddy seat behind my bike. When she leans back, the helmet flops down over her face like a face mask. It doesn't matter how tight we squeeze it, it's just never comfortable and always ends up over her face. We think this has to be more dangerous than riding without a helmet at all. We've looked into other companies and nobody seems to make a helmet designed to work well with child seats"
4,Dawn,This item is recommended for the price it sounds very good. So far I hadn't have it for too long so as far as lasting value I'm no help there. It's a fun item and the colors makes them easy to know which one is your boom box. The price is right.
3,Super Reader,"A strangler is a work, along with a couple of mobsters named Flash and Dip. A little on the dull side, this adventure.The Cult in question have a thing for Kali and a bit of Thug methodology.Plenty of agents running around, Burke, Burbank, Rutledge, Marsland, and poor Harry Vincent gets knocked out and captured."
2,Of poor quality,"This is a very poor quality DVD. (In fact, one of the star's names is spelled wrong in the credits. Yikes.) This is two ""Great Performances"" from PBS that have been mushed together to create one movie. The two stories are not related, and it is jarring to jump back and forth between the two."
2,Disappointing...,"I hesitated on this purchase because of the mostly bad reviews but thought maybe I would receive a clean DVD, not the case. It was so out of focus at times that it was difficult to distinguish faces, let alone details. Both short stories had the potential to be interesting given they were set in the time when Hollywood was a glamourous place. (I always enjoy the nostalgic feeling the cars, costumes and sets provide.) Plus both stories dropped off as if they ran out of film, just like many reviewers stated. Could NOT hold a candle to movies such as Chinatown, LA Confidential or Mulholland Falls. Sending it back..."
2,could have been better,michelle pfeieffer is good but the movie could have been so much better.the scenery and costumes where wonderfulbut it left a lot to be desired.
5,Rameau and the Rococo,"I used to think the Rococo was nothing but Mozart and Haydn with a few lesser lights imitating them. I discovered Rameau in college when I bought an old Vox recording of Les Indes back in the 1960s. Gunter Kerr led his fine ensemble in a forthright performance. This recording by the Chapelle royale is a revelation. This is the full--as far as I can tell--set of incidental music to the opera, and what a joy the music is. It is full of the Rameau touches, and this recording along with another recording of the suites from La Naissance d'Osiris by the very fine Capella Savaria belongs in any serious rococo lover's library. Tops all the way--the Chaconne from the Les Indes being one of the supreme gifts of Rameau's art."
2,Sad. Terrible.,"I was required to read this book for school, and found it throughly depressing. Its a series of short stories about teen immigrants, most of which end in sadness. Don't buy unless you like depressing stories."
2,Scammed by the book?,"It was bad enough that the accompaning CD was filmed in the stone age, with a tiny amount of information, none that differed from the book, nor with any new information as the guy skips/leaps over the steps. But what was a huge time waster, angered me and left me out to hang was the so-called online resource with ""tutors"" available during certain times of the day. Well, that site is a mess. Totally unworkable and a lie.I spent hours tying to login in and signup and search (finding only dead end sites). By the time I gave up I was profoundly frustrated and I felt cheated. If that's why the book cost an arm and a leg then we have been deceived.And thinking about it now, the book's examples are pretty helpful for the easy problems in the chapters but a problem with more complicated situations and the book leaves you again out of help.What a disgrace."
1,This book was not very helpful.,"This book was the text for a class I took. Everyone, including the teacher, found it almost impossible to learn from the book. We used it for exercises and examples, but that was about it."
1,Prudent and predictable with gardening advice.,"Puritanical love story mixed with farming and gardening almanac-style advice. The sexiest quote from this story is ""spasmodic tides of liberation"" while they are making love. Predictable story and stereotypical characters."
5,Seven Up = Seven Stars,"Pork Recordings is easily Humberside's greatest export. For the last ten years, the label has released some of the most original downtempo music in Britain (if not the world). Baby Mammoth a.k.a Mark Blissenden and Andrew Burdall met at Spiral Groove Records in Hull, the rest as we say is history.The real strength of Baby Mammoth's 'Seven Up' is it's ability to be more than just static, more than just an accompaniment to horizontal dreaming. Sharing its lush textures and emphasis on musicality, the duo's sound is akin to deep house, albeit in a vat of treacle. It moves, undoubtedly, but its own languorous pace completely oblivious to the world outside."
3,Large band,"I bought this for my mom's birthday and had it sent directly to her in Arizona. She told me it was beautiful but that the watchband was so large that it would not stay on her average-size wrist. In fact, it went all the way up to her elbow before it fit. The design of the band was such that it could not be resized to fit properly. I arranged for a return and that was handled satisfactorily."
5,Excellent,"I thought this book was excellent. A bit dated in it's diction but good nonetheless. I enjoyed how each point was made and then examples were provided. I am a designer, so I study people often and I found this book very helpful because it showed me the breadth of a persons life that culture is a part of and thus why one can't always trust their own assumptions; especially when dealing with people from different backgrounds."
2,It was okay; not what I expected.,"It was okay; not what I expected. The book was not easy to follow along. I actually stopped reading it after the first chapter because I was bored. It is very slow and doesn't give any facts, but the story line is weak. So either way, I was not engaged or interested."
4,Not that bad,"Other reviews of this recording have been very harsh, but I don't think the situation is really that grim. I have owned this for years now, and must admit that I have never listened to it much, and was of the mind that it was a bit dull. I finally listened to it again recently, and at one point I perked up and thought to myself, ""this is really quite a good performance"". It goes without saying, of course, that the music itself is quite fine.The baroque flute always has a somewhat languid and aloof quality to its sound, and I don't think Robert Claire is by any means inferior to, say Lisa Beznosiuk, Rachel Brown, Bart Kuijken or Marc Hantai. Also, I don't hear that the continuo is ever out of sync with the flute. I won't go so far as to say this recording is a revelation, or the best these works can sound, but it is solid, and I think a good performance overall."
1,A Disservice to Couperin,"I have to agree wholeheartedly with Nancy Moran's review: this recording is played as though the three are completely bored by Couperin. The result is a real disservice. Particularly disappointing is the unimaginative, standard, inelegant, boring continuo playing of Davitt Moroney. Ter Linden, likewise sounds as though he wished he were playing with other players - like Musica Antiqu Koln, perhaps! - rather than the dry English performers at his side."
4,good but....,I have just finished reading the book and found it sound and a good starting place for more advanced study.However it has faults that are quite annoying!1.There are too many diagrams that are suppose to illustrate points that are perfectly clear in the text.2.A LOT of misprints and typos.This actually helped me learn in a perverse way because I was forced to figure things out on my own.But it also had a cost in time.3.No bibliography.4.No glossary!5.No answers to any of the exercises.This is quite helpful in self study.Enough whining! Basically I liked the book.
5,Great cd,Tracks...1) Joy2) This Rhythm Sound3) You Come And Go4) So Into You5) Beautiful6) On & On7) In Your Eyes8) My Heart9) My Only Love10) Cold11) Joy (Reprise)12) I Don't Know What To Do
4,It'll do.,"Sony LCS-TWA/T Portfolio Style Soft Leather Brown Carrying Case for W and T Series Cyber-shot CamerasSure is nice feel/look. Bought a bigger cloth one for any accessories too.Sony LCS-CST General Purpose Soft Carrying Case for Slim Cybershot Digital Cameras.Took the leather one dancing, hid well on my belt underneath my shirt. Quick draw allowed me to take some videos with my T-100."
3,This episode jumped the shark,"I don't normally review rentals, but I have been enjoying the Wallander series. This is the least enjoyable episode. The plot is comical."
1,aspect ratio?,"does anyone have a problem with the aspect ratio of Wallander ""Mastermind""?. Amazon displays it in stretched out 16:9 where it seems it should be 2.39:1"
1,Nice at First.....,"Absolutely loved this huge roaster at first. Then, the 4 points where the metal rack touches the bottom began to wear through the non-stick lining......soon, big strips of lining were coming off, and the rack itself rusted something terribly. I'm now afraid to use it since the lining sticks to food and I'm not sure of its safety for ingestion. I'm trying to find a way to have it repaired."
3,it smells inside?,"I just recived this roaster, and It has a awful smell to it!!I bought this as a gift so I really do not want to wash it first.Has anyone else had this problem when they first opened there box? that sticky smell!!ewwww...I have to say this looks like a very nice Roaster, and the reviews seem to be good...But if any of you have had this experiance, please let me know?Thank You..."
5,Great price. Great product.,I've worked around Skincare and cosmetics for years and this brand is the only one that has worked on my sensitive skin. Great for all ages. My aesthetician uses it and recommended it. Start early if you can! I thought my skin was oily because I was breaking out all the time so I was drying it out with ALL KINDS of expensive stuff. Come to find out that I'm dry and my skin was over producing oil to compensate hence the acne. Elemis cleared it up in about three months to get all the congestion out. Amazing. It works on ANY type of skin. I got it for my mom and my aunt. It improves the texture of the skin as well!
2,Crinkle?,"This toy was much smaller than I expected it to be, and I could not make it crinkle. I don't think it does. That was disappointing as that was the main reason we bought it. We were giving it to a baby in a ""goodie bag"" at my daughter's birthday party. We ended up having to get another gift because this looked too puny to give on it's own. It's cute looking, and it's a rattle, so babies would still like it. I would probably spring for the big one next time though, if I buy it at all."
3,Small size inhibits crinkling,"This is a very sweet looking toy, but it is so small that the crinkly effect is much less than in the larger version. It is nice for smaller hands, though, and very soft."
4,Good Value,The best SD monitor for the price!Nice blue gun features and 16X9 options.But you might be better off just going straight to HD instead of getting this.
5,Beautiful!,"When Nicole sings ""Hallejulah"", it is so uplifting and praise worthy to our Lord! You'll love this cd! Praise God for giving Nicole such a beautiful voice!"
3,Good solo effort,"This CD has Nicole's signature on it. Her style is unmistakable. However, I believe like brother Todd, she is better with Selah than solo."
1,Disappointing Rhymes and Verses,"I purchased this book mainly to be able to read some of my old favourite poems to my young grandchildren. Previously I had been reciting the poems from memory and the kids were so attentive. I thought that the book would have some nice illustrations to go with the poems -as I remembered from my old school readers. Sadly there are very few illustrations in this book and they are black and white. I kept the book thinking that the kids might still like to hear the poetry- but when i tried to read it to them recently, they kept asking for pictures to ""show the story"". Anyways, now i am stuck with it and it will sit on the bookshelf.Too much money for such a book.I am disappointed."
1,"OK, but","I find Amazon's descriptions of various pills to be missing a great deal of information. They offer small bottles, and large bottles, at different prices, but what they don't tell you is that the size of the tablet is different sometimes, so it makes it difficult at best to figure out what the dosing is, or whether one size is the same as what you got previously.To make matters worse, this wafer is substantially larger than the tablets I got in a smaller jar on my last order, yet the dosing recommendation on the jar label is the same. I have to call the company to see what the story is."
1,Was hoping they would work...,"We have been giving these pills to our dog everyday faithfully for months and we still have yellow spots everywhere in the grass. We keep hoping it works, but I think its time we try something else. We are about to lay $400 worth of sod, so I need to find another product to use. This is the SECOND time we have put sod down. So frustrating..."
4,Saves my grass,I have Zoysia grass and this has worked very well with keeping the grass from browning. The wafers are better for larger dogs instead of the tablets.
1,Outrageous,"Whatever is inside this book, good or bad, is irrelevant.If you know even the least bit about the sacrifice represented by the famous photo and (later) monument that is vandalized on the cover of this book, then you know what an obscenity the cover is.Disgusting and inexcusable."
4,Handy inexpensive reference book,"This is a handy little book, including many specifics on music notation, well worth the price. While it may not include everything on notation, its convenient format allows quick answers to many questions regarding formal music notation. I am using it in post-grad composition studies as a quick reference. I'd advise it for all music majors, and anyone with an interest in music writing."
4,Awesome!!!,"I was asked to do Business cards and Flyers for a friend who isopening an errand service/catering business. This system wasperfect for doing exactly what I need. There is tons of clip art.My son has even used the program for school, and he loves beingable to add animals in his stories."
3,"Beautiful voice, flawed album","I have waited for a recital album to come from this young soprano ever since I heard her Angelica in the recent recording of Il Trittico. I was disappointed in the resulting album, however--Gallardo-Domas's voice is large and beautiful, but she doesn't quite have the vocal technique or ability to sing some of these arias. In the verismo pieces, such as the Puccini selections or the Catalani aria, she is quite good, although her ""Senza Mamma"" was much better in the Trittico recording. In the previous recording, she demonstrated an ability to float a beautiful pianissimo high note, but she seems to have lost a little of that on this album. Her vibrato is uncontrolled and sometimes seems to take over her voice. The Verdi and Bel Canto selections are much worse--the less-than-perfect technique that is permissable in Verismo is unacceptable here. Her coloratura on ""Sempre libera"" is simply painful to listen to, and why she would choose to record this aria is beyond me."
5,"Sweet, hard to watch, underrated...","The acting is superb. The story is relatively simple -- two brothers: one is a medical student, the other is a retarded man who works as a garbage collector to put his brother through medical school. Loving, affectionate, thoughtful, the movie show us how they relate through good times and bad, including an incredibly difficult-to-watch sequence that explains their most important secrets and motivations. With the ever-reliable and delightful Jamie Lee Curtis in a quiet supporting role as another medical student (and love interest for Liotta).Lovely, understated movie that deserves a wider audience."
5,Dominick and Eugene,This is a fabulous movie. I had attended a premier in the 80's. It arrived quickly and was of excellent quality!! I will never hesitate to order through you.
2,very dumbed-down information; good for ages 2-4 only,"A very basic introduction to trees. Definitions are given to easy (common) terms such as saplings, seedlings, limbs, and the trunk. Leaves of 27 different trees are identified. The book is way too oversimplified to be very useful; for example, it states things live in three zones in a forest, the ground, the middle branches, and the upper branches, but it does not give examples of what lives in these zones.I was very disappointed in the content of this book. It is way too dumbed-down. Perhaps it would be useful for the very young reader (2 years old through 4) who has no knowledge of trees at all. I felt that other than knowing (all of) the different leaf identifications, my five year-old already knows this information based on casual conversation and his own observation!The illustrations are hand drawn and charming, and the main character is an elderly man named Crinkleroot who gives a mysterious and weird explanation that he was born in a tree."
4,"Helpful book, but note that it is only 54 pages","This book has a narrow focus that addresses one of the most challenging parts of the application process.It has the information you need, but it is only 54 pages which makes it expensive when you add shipping as well.For me this book was worth the cost as I'm trying to give myself every advantage possible, but if you're on a budget, you might want to consider getting a more general book first and then buying this only if you are still concerned about how your oral interview might go."
5,Well worth the Money!,"Buy this BOOK! I bought this book two weeks prior to my first review board. I was curious as to what questions I may be asked while in front of a review board/hiring panel. More than that I was worried about what answers I may give. This book eased my mind and prepared me for each step (including what to wear and how to sit).I was asked 16 questions by the board with at least half of the questions having been in this book! (Probably more) I saw a review posted that someone did not like the ""quality"" of the book itself. Who cares? They could have sent me the info on napkins! This book gave me the extra confidence and answers I needed to walk away from the board with my head up. The Sergeant in charge of the review board told me afterward how impressed he was with me. Best $20 bucks I have spent in a long time."
2,Toylike junk,"The problem with this item is poor design, and really cheap, toylike, quality. It's difficult to use, and I wouldn't trust the findings. This, to me, was a complete waste of money, and I'm puzzled as to how something so utterly junky, can get a foothold in this type of market. Hobbled together with ordinary alligator clips, wire, and common parts that are available almost anywhere, the question is what is it? My guess is that there's some sort of patent in the circuitry, and this explains why the price is so outrageous. Checking this product with other outlets, reveals what appears to be price fixing, because anybody selling it, charges the same price! My advice? Save your money, there are better ways to test your precious metals."
5,haunting,My first O'Connell book...Sadie Green is by far the most vibrant literary character I've come across this year. I am not often affected by books days after completing them (I usually have my nose in another one) but this one stays with me.
4,want more,I resisted buying this for a long time because it wasn't Mallory but I cave and got and boy m I glad. She don't it again a story that will haunt you and that you will think about for a long time to come. I didn't think that it was slow more that build up was in real tme. I just wish she would arite another one with some of these characters.
3,Book has a split personality?,"The author obviously has writing talent, but is this book just too ambitious and too ""literary""? Too many characters, subplots, moodswings, and shifts in viewpoints? What is this book trying to be? The portrayal of the psychiatrist and the doctor/client privilege is unforgiveable IF this is a Contemporary & Socially Conscious Thriller, but if its a Modern Gothic Horror Story, where everyone is off his/her rocker from the very beginning, then the Dr. Mortimer Cray character works. Melodramatic. Enjoyed weeping at the end. Odd and uneven book, but still glad I read it."
3,Book club choice- the Judas child,Read the Judas child for our book club.. Had a hard time getting into it but finally at about 43% it all came together.. The ending was a total surprise.. Overalla pretty good read.
5,"O'Connell's thrillers refresh,excite and titillate.","Having exhausted the following formula genres: catastrophic diseases, millenium mysteries, clandestine county rewrites, forensic forays, detective fiction disappointments and horrific horror mainstays that have run out of gas, I asked my librarian to recommend something fresh and exciting. ""Judas Child"" by O'Connell was recommended. I do not find child abuse or pedophiles amusing but I read the book. It was tremendous, well-written, exciting, etc. So, I read all of her previous books. Her dialogue is witty yet savvy. Why aren't you promoting her books more? Someone needs to contact Putnam to let them know they are focusing on the wrong mainstream authors who have ""run out of gas"" and are now just churning out disappointing story-lines just to meet deadlines. I hope O'Conner reconsiders and continues the Mallory saga. Her two new characters Ali and Rouge should also be developed and promoted. O'Connell has given me reason to read again!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Judas Child was chosen as our book club book for January and I almost didn't read the book. (They would never choose a psycological thriller) Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down and stayed up way past my usual bedtime reading it. This is my type of book, a page turner, twisted plot and surprise ending. Carol O'Connell is definitely on my list of must read authors."
4,Sadie and Gwenn,"I loved this book. Sadie and Gwenn complimented each other so well, one with bravery and the other with the ability to think things through. I was in love with Sadie the moment I ""met"" her. I empathized with Gwenn and her shortcomings throughout the chapters. These two girls touched my heart and my spirit. So needless to say the ending broke my heart. I will be looking up more titles by Carol O Connell."
5,"Awesome, gutt-wrenching, rivoting thriller!!!!","I loved this novel. It is the first by Carol O'Connell that I have read. I was pinned to this book. The girls, especially Sadie, are so resourceful and witty. What gumption! I was late for work for staying up too late reading this one! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a great thriller. Not too scary, not too gross--just the right amount of fear and creepiness! I've got to get hold of more of her novels!!"
2,Does it get better?,I have read about 100 pages into this book and I don't find it particulary gripping or interesting - does it get better?
1,Confusing and disjointed,"I read this book after reading all the recommendations .. and thought wow, okay, lets try this .. I had not read any of her work before.The first few pages were wonderful and I got myself prepared to get thoroughly absorbed. After *finally* finishing the book, I am disappointed - I found this book's writing style jumpy, with hacked-off sentences where one is left trying to guess what the person was trying to say ... and the whole plot is just kind of scattered. The only reason I finished the book was because of Sadie and Gwen - for the rest, I lost track of who did what to whom and why after the first 100 pages or so - I found the storytelling and the writing style too erratic, busy and unflowing.. the plot drowned in too many characters and subplots .. it just lost me completely."
2,"Dull, Dull,Dull.....yawn!","Wow, after reading the other reviews here I was excited to start this book. Can't believe it's the same book as everyone else here has read. The girls get snatched then it's a long, long, time till much else happens. Anyway, must just be me as everyone else LOVED this book so much. But I did find it DULL."
3,Rip Off,"This was a good book, but it way too long, at least 50 pages could have been cut. The book was a rip-off of a famous movie, I won't give you the title of the movie or you will know what the book is about. There was nothing original about this book, thou I most say all the characters were well written and interesting. The most interesting characters in the book were Rouge, Sadie and David, who should have had a bigger part in the book. This would have been a five-star book, but I gave it only three stars because there was too much useless information which made for boring reading."
2,"Started well, but failed to interest me in the characters.","This book started well. It had me setup for what I hoped was going to be a real nice read. Unfortunately, this did not happen. There was so much jumping around, I thought I was reading the script for a music video. I was unable to follow any of the characters early enough to really care what happens to them. But, I did care what happened to the two girls, thats why I finally skipped to the end of the book before I even reached the middle. Something I have only done once before in my life. I can't quantify why these characters failed to involve me, but I can't wait for a new Katherine Mallory novel."
2,Good until the end,"I liked this book until I got to the end - I felt it a little too drawn out - but it still kept me interested. However, the author does not wrap things up too well. She leaves us too much in the ""lurch"". Like what is this whole thing about the priest and Arnie and their eyes? And what about the conversation between Rouge and Mortimer - what was that all about? And what about Sadie?I really HATE it when an author keeps me going and then leaves me FLAT - which is exactly the way I felt when I finished this book! It's kind of like the Grisham novels - he's got you going all over the place - than blam! - Nothing!This is the first novel I've read by Carol O'Connell and it will likely be my last! I only read it because a friend gave it to me a couple of years ago, and I ran out of things to read. What a waste of time!"
1,Negitive -10 stars,"This book was poorly written! Instead of flowing from point A to B etc. it flit here and there in a herky jerky unreadable fashion. Full of irrelevant garbage. They could of edited out 150 pages and the book still would of been of questionable merit. Her writing style is best described as BACKWARDS!, cluttered, unclear, muddled.It was awash with cowflop. It was DULL...BORING.... No action, no thrills. No character interaction. The story was boring. The characters were dead & UNREALISTIC, to say the least! I felt absolutely NOTHING for any of the players. It gave me a headache. $7.00 down the drain."
3,Decent puzzle game,Do you remember Sonic the Hedgehog bonus levels where you have to spin the level around to try and find the emeralds? It's like that. Decently fun puzzle game. I had to check it out for myself because there were no other reviews. Now you know.
2,You get what you pay for...,"After my dog chewed through the power cord for my Toshiba laptop, I tried a cheap out in buying this product ($25 v. $140). The lack of the Underwriters Laboratories seal should have been a warning sign. After only a month of no extraordinary use, the wiring has been exposed due to peeling of brittle plastic on both ends of the adapter and near the plug head. I can tell you that the internal wires are blue, pink, and a yellow/green ground. However, the cord does work; mine is now being shielded in about five yards of electrical tape."
1,FALSEHOODS ABOUND!,"Completly false, and I am delighted to see this slop falling into the garbage pile where it belongs. Robert Slatzer was never married to Marilyn Monroe, in fact he never knew her beyond the fan/star meeting on the Niagra movie set. Anyone who quotes Robert Slatzer in their bios on Marilyn are only perpetrating the falsehood, and proving they did little primary research. They paraphrased others without testing the validity of the information. This kind of fake, hack writing is a freak of our times and truly a disaster!"
2,Designed by commitee,This item was obviously designed by commitee. What they laughingly call a charging base is nothing more than an inconvenient holder. It is impossible to charge the unit while on the charging base. How stupid is that? Why bother? Don't even include that part and lower the price.As far as opening cans it is difficult to use. Had an older model and it was better.
4,Great new idea,"This can opener is wonderful. light weight, easy to use, stores away great. The only thing that I noticed was that you can not charge it while it is in the holding case.Well worth the purchase."
1,Garbage,"I can't get mine to even pierce the can, takes 10 minutes of fiddling around to get it to pierce the can and then maybe it will open it half way. Save your money!"
1,Dont' Buy this Product,"this can opener is garbage. it opened a couple of cans, then quit. if you pushed it along, i could get it to open maybe half way around. now i get nothing. no matter how long you recharge the thing, it does nothing more than make a grinding noise and stops. doesn't even start to open the can. don't waste your money."
3,Not what I expected,I was actually looking for a different color. This one didn't blend into my skin as beautifully as my favorite. Would still buy this product in Natural.
3,"Good, but expected more","A very good, detailed instruction for tube fly tying. The downfall, only 5 patterns with little variation among the 5. Would like to have had more patterns/tying methods to view. Also would be nice to have some sources for tube flies materials mentioned. Little pricey for what you get."
4,Inner Circle,"This addition to the Detective Inspector Carol Ashton mysteries is one of the best. Loose ends in Carol's personal life come together. As always, Claire McNab weaves a tale of intrigue and suspense. I have read all of the previous books featuring the premier lesbian detective, and have never been let down! I highly recommend this book!"
5,Berio CD is a Find,"As a fan of the music of Luciano Berio, I'm always on the look-out for recordings I might have missed.I was delighted to find this one. Laborintus 2 combines many elements such as the sung word, the spoken word, progressive classical and jazzelements to form a new concept in theatrical music. The performance on this CD took me by surprise. How could I have missed itbefore? There might be one small gripe, the lack of a text and translation. But I assume that that was to keep the price down.Anyway, don't you missout on this."
3,very intersting,This is an intersting book on a what happen to a John Procter and his family and land after he was killed during the Salem Witch trails. I gave it a lower rating because it does not have the map incuded that the author keeps referancing when he is describing land marks.
4,The contents are marvellous,"This book has the authentic recipes (from someone who grew up in Hong Kong- Singapore is a close neighbour and a very mighty economic competitor, we are reasonably familiar with their food) from Hawkers fares to restaurant menus, and they are laced with background information and good coffee-table grade illustrations. Indeed, the Singapore Tourism Board rrecommends this book along with Mrs Lee Chin Koon (who is the late mother of Lee Kwan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore) ""The New Mrs Lee's Cookbook"" and Sylvia Tan's ""Singapore Heritage Food"" as good references to Singapore's food.But as the others mentioned, the only drawback is binding - it doesn't quite withstand tear. I am confident the publisher will fix this in their next batch though as I also own a couple of other cookbooks from them and the bindings are still strong after 4 years."
3,book binding is of poor quality,"Sadly,the binding is poor and doubt it will last the distance if one were to use it often, minor corrections on the proof reading is also required. I still have Terry Tan's first publication of the Her World cookbook of Singapore recipes and sincerely believe this is still the best publication produced, certainly worth every dime.As for the ""Shiok"" cook book,nice glossy pictures but deserve a rating of 3 star."
2,mediocore at best,"This is a visually beautiful cookbook worthy of coffee table status thanks to the photography.However, the recipes and narrative are another story. The sentences are awkward and grammatically incorrect (for a big budget cookbook, this is unforgivable), and the recipes themselves are suspect (for example, soy sauce in fried rice is a common but amateurish mistake that the authors perpetuate in this book).Buy this book to see how the dishes should turn out, but look for the recipes somewhere else."
5,Shaping a world,"Lynn Emanuel's work in this combined collection is fresh and daring. It isn't surprising that some readers find it off-putting to encounter an entirely confident voice that doesn't beg a reader's approval but marches on with the keen intellect, humor, sharp and engaging characters and stories. Additionally Emanuel's imagery challenges and re-dresses the old cherry blossoms of verse."

1,Mediocre,The poems in this collection could have been written on a type writer BY a type writer as Randall Jarrell would have put it. Let us not fool ourselves by bad poetry anymore. Save us from this mediocrity!!!
1,ASTONISHING DRIVEL,With this book of poetry Ms. Emanuel conclusively proves that she is indeed the finest example of America's minor Poets.
2,Mary Higgins Clark CD,I purchased this as a gift for a family member in the hospital. She's a fan of Mary Higgins Clark but the first book was disturbing and not the right gift. I'm hoping she didn't get discouraged and not listen to the other books. Probably my last purchase of a CD when I'm unfamiliar with the author's works.
5,An excellent front line review of important history,"White witnessed China in the late 30's and early 40's, the Marshal plan implementation in Europe in the 50's and the Kennedy presidential years. His writing style is engaging. He was friends with interesting people. He had a stimulating personal life. Altogether, a marvellous book."
5,A great view of the history of China,"Although the book covers the author's whole life as a journalist, by far the best part is when he discusses his experiences as a young journalist covering the war in pre and during WWII. You get an up front view of what it was like to experience the drastic change that occured in China at that time..."
2,Not her best work,"It was a long time coming, and I was really looking forward to this after 'Spirit' (which is really great, by the way). But, sadly, it's no 'Spirit'. Lavelle has an amazing voice and is a phenomenal cellist, but perhaps playing the cello on other people's works is something she should stick to, as she seems to do that best.Of course, that doesn't mean I won't keep an ear out to see if the next effort improves. This one just seemed to be an attempt because it was what was expected after a successful first attempt. There's no cohesion and nothing really stands out.If you're just filling out your collection, it won't be the worst thing you could buy, but it's not the best, either."
1,Gets One Star Because I Can't Give It 0,"I bought this CD based on the other reviews here and I am sorry I did! I am a HUGE fan of Loreena McKennitt, I have all her CDs and was looking for something similar but new. Caroline Lavelle's voice doesn't begin to compare and the songs don't soothe or inspire, they jar you with discordance or bum you out. The whole album is depressing and irritating. I listened a second time, to be fair, and disliked it even more. But then I am probably the only person who likes Celtic/New Age music but can't stand Enya either!"
2,"Rugged Material, poorly constructed","I generally like Wrangler products, but these slacks were disappointing. The material itself was good, but the construction was absolutely poor. It took only a couple of wearings before the clasp started to pull from the material. Several washes and the clasp was gone. But since it has a button no big deal right? Well, not exactly, that disappeared a couple of washes later.The fit was good (one of the reasons I like Wrangler, they don't just take ""skinny cuts"" and make them bigger, these are made properly for size)... that being said the finish on these was not up to snuff."
1,Terrible Fit sizing all wrong,These pants are of low quality and the sizing isn't even close. Possibly made by a blind edward scissorhands. Please save your money and do not purchase.
1,Didn't match the pictures,I specifically bought these pants because one of the pictures showed the elastic band feature on the side...but these pants DON'T have that feature. So NOT what I wanted. boo... The color was a darker khaki than the pictures show but honestly more what I was looking for and the material was truly strong like people commented...but still the main feature I wanted was wrong.
2,Would not buy again.,"When I recieved the pants I tried them on and the only thing I noticed was the button was already about to fall off, but I have sewed many buttons in my day and this didn't bother me too much. After a washing I actually put them on for work for the first time and they are almost like bell bottoms. I don't like ""skinny"" pants that get way narrow down there but these were down right baggy. Then the button fell off so I had sewed that back on and put them back on for work. I found myself walking on the cuff and after measuring found the inseam to be about 33 1/2 inches, which is a bit long for pants that are supposed to be 32 inches. This would have been one star but the material is kinda nice and I will probably wear these on days I know I'll be doing something dirty at work, just sitting here they do feel kinda okay. Other than that I would almost believe I got these from a first year fashion student who hasn't learned to measure and sew yet."
5,Tugboats of New York: An Illustrated History,This is a perfect example of not just another tugboat book. The author exhibits his first hand knowledge of the marine towing industry and has illustrated his book with great vintage black and white photos that show the story without being just a collection of boat photos more suitable for a calendar. This is the best book about tugboats that has been published for a very long time.
3,"It's not all that, but not bad","This book has great pics, and some good info. My only real problem with the book is you can tell the book is by someone that is anti-union. I hate it when I want a piece of history without all the little jabs of a persons opinion. It's like I get it, everyone hates union people, we get it. Some cool pics, but I would look for something else."
2,Very good book... for the beginners,"The book disappointed me. If you are causal computer user and you have decided to start designing web pages, read this book. It covers all the basics and help you avoid making a lot of mistakes. However, the book does not go beyond the basics. If you are proficient with computers, played a little with images, designed (rather poorly) a couple of web sites and want to be a better designer of web graphics, you will learn little from the book. Even if you perfect everything what is in the book, it would not be sufficient for you to become a good web designer.We are still waiting for a good book for intermediate and advanced web graphics designer."
2,Try Checking Elsewhere,"The artwork in this book is not very good at all. The author's use of color is appaling.I'm a web design/graphic arts student, and I think the best way to design web graphics is to first take a few art courses, especially in color and 2-D design. Then learn the technical aspects of putting the designs on the web. You can't get it all from a book.This is borne out by the fact that here are millions of web pages out there, put only about 5% of them are aesthetically appealing.If you need to get quick design ideas from a book to do a ""quick and dirty"" web page, check out the ideas in the book, ""Creating Killer Web Sites,"" or browse the Graphic Design section of a bookstore."
2,Unoriginal and not worth the money.,"Luckily, my bookstore all but reads the book to you in comfy lounge areas before you make a purchase. The ridiculous price tag, coupled with the lack of information in this book, is only topped by the fact that most of lynda's designs are, well, unappealing in the least. More specifically, they're downright ugly."
3,Haven't read the whole book and not sure that I want to,"I bought the book on a recommendation. I was poking around, looking at different things, when I happened upon the explanation of hexidecimal [sic] numbers used in html color. She explains that hexadecimal is a base-9 numbering system, when in fact it is a base-16 system. In addition, the chart next to this explanation goes from 0 to E, when in fact, it should go to F. It just proves that she knows nothing about this minor facet of the book, and makes me wonder if the rest of the information in the book is just as off base."
5,Excellent,"I find that all of Lyndas books are excellent. I have been able to create some wonderful pages on my own by using her examples and following her easy to understand guide lines. There are a lot of Web Design books on the market, and most of them say the same things over and over again. With Lynda's books I know she's telling it like it is in the most easies format possible. Everyone wants to be a star on the internet, and Lynda tells you how to get there the simplest and yet the best creative way possible...Thanks Lynda for be a great source of help and inspiration...."
5,This one to the rescue if u think u know some yet forget all,"This book is very useful, either for beginner or advance user. I find that whatever I think I knew some of it already, yet I still able to find some 'extra' useful tips from it. So, I won't behave as I knew it all because after go thru this book, it reveals quite a lot of things which I 'don't actually know' You had do me proud, Lynda!"
2,Way too artistically oriented,"This book is only good from the artistic point of view. It deals greatly with color, font, and graphics, but very little time is spent on the mechanics of page building or anything else practical. Most people allready know what looks good and what doesn't. They aren't born knowing how to make a good web page, and this book won't get them any closer to knowing."
5,Excellent for web designers of all levels!,"Not being an expert in web design, I purchased this book in the hopes of getting tips and tricks on how to make my graphics and text look good on the web. I read the book cover to cover and extracted extremely valuable information from each chapter. From browser-safe color to effects with graphics, this book tells all in a down-to-earth, humorous style that is quite easy to read. Since the purchase of this book, I've purchased all other books by Lynda. Thank you Lynda for your wonderful insight!"
3,Had to return the book...,"I saw a great interview with Lynda on MSNBC anddecided to take a look at DWG 2 and one of her otherbooks, Coloring Web Graphics. I was a bit disappointed with DWG 2. The best parts of the book are covered three-fold in Coloring Web Graphics. If you're looking for a good web design book beyond a beginner's level, I suggest Siegel's Creating Killer Websites. I did enjoy Lynda's writing though and recommend Coloring Web Graphics to designers of all levels."
5,A wonderful art injection to combat html geek syndrome,"I keep reading lynda's book over and over.HTML tagging is really pretty darn simple. So why are there so many crummy net sites? Obviously, the art of creating a nice site is beyond the HTML tags. It has something to do with graphic design.The book has many nice examples, lots of good advice, and the layout of the book is pleasing and easy to read.Put on your beret, throw away your pocket-protector, and get some inspiration for your next web project.Expensive? You bet. Worth it? Yes, yes, yes"
2,"BIG, but half empty","I've used this book (I don't actually READ technical books) a few times and find it helped me some times, I admit. However I find very vague and frankly, I quickly get tired of this self-advertising both her and Siegel make all the time about themselves. Every other line we have to read her tale of ""I did this"" and ""read my other book"" and of course, ""here is my URL"". Sure it is necessary and honest if one talks about one's experience, but I believe this is too much. I also find that Weinman's objective is on quantity and not quality: a lot of things here are easily DISPENSABLE, even if you are a beginner, not to mention the useless Photoshop and Illustrator classes she gives (if I want to learn about Photoshop, I will buy a book about it). Finally, I agree with someone here that mentioned the (lack of) quality of her own site: I only trust Lynda on some technical info, never because of her (poor) design skills."
2,Not much written on the Picts,"This is a typical Osprey book - a primer to a niche subject. In this case, the coverage is nigh perfect. The text states that there is not much written on the Picts because not much is known about them. Thus there is a lot of cross-referencing to Celtic and other sources just to get an idea about the Picts.The illustrations are terrible. There is a great divide beween text and illustrations. The Picts disavowed the use of armour to flaunt their courage and loved to fight naked to show off their tattoos. The illustrations all depict clothed and armoured Picts. The line drawings hint at the missed opportunity to depict some truly magnificent paintings based on the abstract animal motifs."
3,"Supportive, yes, attractive no","I have the t-shirt bra in n this same brand and love it, but this one although supportive, just not attractive. I'm a 30G and I know I can't expect to wear those lacy cute bras the smaller girls get to wear, but I would like somewhat attractive. I'm not ready to look like a granny just yet."
2,I used to love this bra,This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup. It's a nice bra if you're looking for that style but I'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup!
5,excellent bra!,"I LOVE this bra. Offers great support. It is not the first I have gotten like it, and the ones I previously purchased have lasted WELL over a year (take note that I do not put my bras in the dryer). I would recommend this bra to anyone looking for good support and comfort in a bra."
3,Material was not the same,I had ordered this same bra from a Lingerie Store about a year ago and this one is not the same quality. The material is thinner and I don't get as much support. But it says it's made by the same manufacturer.
5,Great Bra!,"This bra is great for every day, for sports, for clingy clothes. Looks great; is very comfortable. I have a terrible time finding a good bra that fits & is comfortable. Full coverage cup. The only thing it's not good for is a plunging neckline."
1,"Save your money, mine is going back!","As always, another book for beginners that makes no sense. If you are like me trying to learn PHP/MySQL it looks like the NET is the way to go. Find tons of tutorials and read them. I only read the first 100+ pages and was not happy. It appears that they DONT KNOW what a beginner is! I'm still looking for a book to get my feet wet, so far I've read the ""in easy steps"" books from BN, and they were simple to grasp. But not enough.This has been one of my biggest complaints with books for beginners... Are they really for some one who knows nothing about the subject? Or is it marketing? You make the call. I have complained forever about this! It appears they start out good then lose it, and you are now stuck.PS This is my first review and I wanted to write it so you can see it really does not help the newbie. Good Luck in your PHP/MySQL learning."
2,Item was nice but shipping was crazy,"For the amount of shipping I paid for this, you would think it would be shipped in something other than an envelope. To top it off, it didnt even really cost that much to ship. All that was on it was a normal stamp. I would not buy this again."
3,Not the Follow-Up to M.I.A.M.I.,"This album goes more like a mixtape than an actually studio album for Pitbull. See, a while back when Pitbull was starting in the rap game, he was signed to Trick Daddy's Slip-n-Slide record label. Now, somehow Pitbull ended up on TVT Records for his debut album ""M.I.A.M.I."" I don't know if T-Double-D dropped Pitbull, or if Pitbull left due to his album never getting released. Either way, this is just a way for Trick Daddy to cash-in on something that he once had with tracks Pit recorded while on Slip-n-Slide. The tracks are okay, but none are as good as any on ""M.I.A.M.I."" Wait for the offical follow-up album from Pitbull and only purchase this if you are a Pitbull fan or just have some extra money to spare."
5,Fantastic,Our Reverend at the Faith United Methodist Church has been using this for our Bible Studies. It is written in a way where the people can read and understand it. We have small groups within our Church who study and discuss each chapter.Each group take it to their level.
1,A reader,"I own the 1998 edition and was crazy about it. If you are new to the Bible, the 1998 edition provided a wonderful starting point to understanding the Bible. If you were a Bible student, the 1998 edition pulled alot of information that you already knew together. I was so enthusiastic about it that I ordered several more of the 2005 edition to give away thinking that the updated version probably had some graphic updates. I was dumbfounded to find that the entire second part of the book had been completely changed!! All the gems that were there have been removed. I'll be returning these and try to find the 1998 edition!!!"
4,Answer to Post-Christian era of students,"I work with college students and have found that many do not know what the Bible _as a whole_ says. This book has been helpful in explaining the entire Bible in one year, especially with International Students. I strongly recommend this book if you work with students of any age, a new believer in Jesus, or for an easy way to re-frequent yourself with the Bible."
5,30 Days to Understanding the Bible,Awesome Book.. I am sharing it with everyone God puts in my path.. To understand the Bible means to know God and that is what I want to do is to know God and make Him Known.. This book helps alot..
5,Good for discipling a new believer,"If you read a map but don't understand the symbols, it is hard to understand and you might end up lost. This book is like a map ledgend but for the Bible. You can muddle through the books of the Bible, understand some of it and still be confused by some of it as it is not chronological. Good for a new believer or a long time Christian, it helps decipher the Bible in an easy to understand way. Great discipleship tool."
4,"Good intro to the Bible, but very light on supporting content","For a person new to the Bible (like myself), Anders provides a very high level summary that really took much less than 30 days. The content was too light, but the exercises does help to remember the very high-level content provided.This book needs more content because the end result is not an ""understanding"" of the Bible, but rather a very high-level summary that can be used as a starting point to learning more about the Bible."
3,Wrong One,"I'm sure it works fine, but.....It wasn't the right size at the tip for my hose where this head screws on! Oops, lol. I guess my hose has a weird sized fitting on the end of it or something, I dunno, but that's not necessarily this products fault. I dunno though, maybe it is, maybe this head has a weird sized opening? I thought both ends were suppose to be universal, LOL! Oh well. I think I will try & find the right sized fitting for the end of my hose to match up with this head. I didn't want to give this a poor rating because of that though, so I just selected that it's ok. Maybe I'll come back after I fix the hose & do an update on this review, seeing as I have no idea if it even sprays or not!"
1,Does not fit,"For a universal fit item it does not fit our sink properly. Do not order this item, spend the money on one that actually has measurements listed."
2,Worked for 18 months,"We bought this to replace a broken sprayer when we bought our house. This sprayer worked well-enough for 18-months. Then, it broke. I want to replace with something nicer; however, I am unsure what that is."
2,unexciting & pointless,"This album isnt as bad as most Flamenco albums I've bought, but it's not real good either. The solo guitar playing just doesnt sound professional; sounds like a guitar student taking lessons, just strumming and banging, no tunes, no melody, just boring stuff. The female's singing reminds me of a cat that was hit by a car, it was crying out in pain just before it died. For hard core fans only."
5,Fits 2000 Nissan Maxima,This is a good quality product and works perfectly. The installation was quicker and easier than I expected. This fan assembly is exactly like the original including the two built-in clips for the hoses. Very happy customer.
2,unnatural shape,"I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive. I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find. The original one that I ordered was tiny. It looked more like a DD, so I went up two cup sizes. The second one I received fit, I suppose. There was no side support and only two clasps in the back. It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all. More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms. Just disappointing. I've had two children and nursed them both, and besides unless they're fake a 30F ain't standing at attention without some help. This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty :("
1,Remember Madonna's look?,Remember Madonna's early 90's look? Not very flattering. I felt like I had ice cream cones on! I will be returning this product.
1,ITCHY AS HECK,While this bra offers support it's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness. I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size isn't the issue.
4,Cleavage enhancing,"Very rarely can I find a cleavage enhancing bra that I don't literally spill out of. . This bra gives a decent amount of equal support and lift for a big busted and small girl. Those of you in the same boat get me. Although I'm big busted I'm not a big fan of minimizing granny bras and this one is pretty. The only thing I might change for a tad more support is a little bit wider straps for more support, otherwise it's awesome."
3,PanacheBra,When I first put it on I said yes finaly ! A sexy bra for a busty me. But after wearing it for a while I noticed the wire was starting to bother me on the side poking my arm as well when reaching up. I should have gone with a larger size I'm in between 40dd and 44dd I ordered 42 next time I'll go with 44 to keep the seam from folding up. Mean while I will give it another go and break it in. I do like it !
4,"Order a size or two smaller, RUNS LARGE, REALLY!","This product is not sized correctly. Order a size or two smaller!! I read the other reviews, and other people said it too, but I ordered my regular size anyway, and well, it really does run large, especially on the top."
5,fantastic!!!,"It's hard finding a bra when your a 32K, especially a cheap! This bra is wonderful and supportive. Mostly importantly it didn't cost me $70 to feel comfortable."
3,Fit gone wrong,"While the band was great - the cup was about 2 sizes too small. Ordered the 30H and returned to get a 30J. Will report to see if the J is any better.Appearance: It looks great on - thught it's a tad hard to determine since my fit was poor. but all-in-all it does seem to be a very pretty bra. Might have some minimizing effects - but still not sure.In review, might want to order a larger cup size on this one."
3,Uncomfortable.,"Unfortunately, the central gores are a little too high and rub on my breastbone. The underwires also tend to poke me under the arms, but I have a very short torso. I do wear the bra when I need excellent support, but I much prefer the Freya Deco."
5,LOVE THIS BRA!!,"I now own this is in beige and black, and both are just beautiful. They are supportive, and they fit perfectly. Best of all, there are only two clasps in back, despite being a 44DD size!! Buy this bra. It's well worth the money you'll spend."
4,It actually fit!,"OK, I'll confess: when I removed this bra from its packaging, I thought ""what in the heck can it do for MY breasts????"" I'm a 38J, and often run into the problem where my band size is too small to find cups big enough for my breasts (actually think I'm more along the lines of a 36, but that's a different story). I was very happy to stumble across the Panache brand. Interestingly enough, they tell us big breasted chicks to stay away from demi/balconette style, but THIS one...this one fits me almost like it was made for me. The cups are sheer w/ pretty embroidery, yet actually rigid enough to hoist up my ""mother earth breasts"" as my fiance calls them. Though it looks dainty, it's actually VERY rigid, and takes me a while to put on (I know it will loosen over time). Looks can be deceiving; if you are a chesty girl, you NEED this bra in your life. Also gives a sexy cleavage line."
1,Boobs too big for comfort,"This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest. I ordered a 28G and it stabbed, did not hold, and hurt my shoulders. After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back! Cheap material, scratchy, and overall not able to support a heavy weight!"
2,Not true to sizing at all,"This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing. Many bra makers make ""fashion"" bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup. Well, they don't work. I'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup. Didn't even begin to come close to the right cup size. My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me---fit perfectly! She looked great in this bra. Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes (C and up) but are not. Bali is true to sizing for me, but everyone is different. This one is being returned."
4,my favorite,"Panache superbra tango II is my favorite. The wire comes up a little too high in middle, but it offers good support and is comfortable which is a hard combo to find in 42 J (uk size)"
2,not the bra for me,ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly. I'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down. When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits. Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable.
1,size not true,"Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers (34 G), but this one was way too small. Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan."
5,Great,"I am a curvy woman, and this bra is just fantastic. I love the underwire as it doesn't dig into my sides. The lace adds a touch of femininity to the garment. well worth the prices"
3,"Great support, not so great if you're short","The support of this bra is amazing. However, the wires and boning come up extremely high, which is difficult when you're short in that area. I took the boning out, and was pleasantly surprised that it's acutally metal. I swapped out wires from a different bra for a bit, but that wasn't working so I put the originals back in. I'll probably get wire cutters and shorten them a bit."
4,"Great bra, not quite to size","This is a great bra that I've worn for years. When I became pregnant I needed bigger bras, because my cup size went up so much. I'm small in the back and usually wear a 30H. I bought this one two cup sizes bigger (30J) than my previous bras, but it fits really funny. Usually as the cup size increases the back strap will get a bit bigger too. But I could barely get this one done up and have to use a strap adjuster (an extra insert you can add to the strap in the back). Otherwise it's a great bra. Just be careful when ordering a larger cup size, that the back might not fit as expected. I'd say the back fits smaller than expected."
1,LIKE A FAILED BOOK,"Bad prose, no ideas, flat information, zero understanding, boring perspectives, one of the all time worst Dylan's bios. Go back, go get ""Behind the Shades: Take Two"". There's nothing happening here and you do know what it is, Do you Mr. Sounes?: a book written at the speed of opportunity. Bobby is sixty. Let's put out a book, someone's gonna buy it... (harmonica solo here)"
4,A Very Good Intro to Dylan - his music and his life,"As a fan of Dylan's music and as someone who is interested in his impact on the industry and peers, this was an excellent book. The author tells a good story and covers a lot of ground. I think the first half of the book covering Dylan's childhood through his twenties, in particular, was terrific. Great stories and quotes from friends, family and business associates make Dylan come alive.The book spends less time on Dylan's last 20-25 years, perhaps because his personal life and music has been more controversial and uneven. No person or artist is perfect, but Dylan's music and his passion for his craft are pretty close at the end of the day.The book does leave one wondering, what is the plight of great music going forward? To me, the music we have today,is not personal, earthy or passionate like Dylan, The Band, The Dead. It's largely slick and overproduced. Some of the same negatives, Dylan sought out to change 50 odd years ago...."
3,Recommended with caveats,"Recommended--with the caveat that Sounes doesn't differentiate between legitimate sources of factual information and easily spotted, self-made mythology: his sources include both diligent research and such notoriously fictionalized utterances as stage patter, liner notes, and casually told anecdotes--all of which he uses as if they were statements out of the congressional record. He also, bafflingly, has failed to remotely begin to understand Dylan's religion, Christianity. He mentions a quote from the Bibical ""book of Paul"" (none exists with that title) and bungles a couple of other easily researched aspects of what is, in this country, not exactly an exotically unknown religion. Still, it's a good read, and gives a sense of a very mysterious performer and almost deified American icon."
3,Nice overview,"This books gives you a good overview of Dylan's life. If you are looking for a book about his music or record sessions, this is not the one to get. But if you want to read about his life, including music but also a lot about personal stuff all of which may not be necessarily true (meaning based on interviews of persons who Dylan may have dropped from his life), this warrents your consideration."
1,A real dissapointment,"I read this book as soon as it came out, and I have to agree with the many people who have said that it's not very good. The problem is that Dylan's early years have already been covered many times, and this book doesn't offer anything of interest that hasn't been reported. That would be okay, but there's nothing interesting here concerning Dylan's music, which is the reason anyone would read a biography in the first place. It seems like the author rushed this out to capitalize on Dylan's upcoming sixtieth birthday. That, and a few boring details of Dylan's private life, will not make this a bestseller, or even a definitive biography. Just one more book that fails to capture the enigma that is Bob Dylan. Listen to Dylan's music if you want to know anything about him, it's all there."
1,Blah Blah Blah,Perhaps I expected too much. And that is what I received: TOO much. This book needs SEVERE editing. I guess the author felt compelled to mention every person who ever met (or at least saw Bob at a concert). Almost nothing new (or even old but previously unknown) about Bob himself.Would probably be helpful for persons wanting to know who was travelling or playing with Bob in any particular week.
1,"Poor, poor, poor - a piece of junk","Badly written, nothing new here. The best thing is the photo of Bob's mother, and the excellent, as always, photo of Bob by John Hume."
1,A Very Bad Read,"This book is a strange mix of shoddy fact checking, unreadable writing, and uninteresting details. It's definitely not intended for anyone who actually appreciates Bob Dylan's music, just for those that recognize his name and have a few hours to kill between flights."
3,"2nd part of a trilogy, and does not stand alone","Wonderful prose, beautifully observed character study, as WG slips into the skin of an extremely priggish and snobbish early twenties aristocrat as he comes of age and begins to understand a little more of the virtues of the ordinary people around him. Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read. I believe that the books in Trilogies should be able to stand alone, if they are to be sold separately, & on that basis, this trilogy definitely fails. I'm glad I read it as a single 750 page tome."
3,Light on Content,"Good book for someone who's never been in a computer-related field and never been into gaming but now wants to get into games. But how many people like there are there?I would argue that most people who want to get into the game industry are either in another tech. industry or are gamers. Either way, most of the content in this book is obvious and can be found on the web with minimal effort.True - it's not a very expensive book. But even so - I felt a little cheated...."
4,"Finally, a book on how to break in to the Gaming Industry!","This book explains the gaming industry, beyond, how to program or the history of games. I have been interested in how the gaming industry works as a whole, and have not been able to find a book on it. I think this a great book for anyone interesting in working in the game industry."
2,Is it only me?,"I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites. The material, style and color are quite lovely. I was excited to try it on. Then my self-esteem fell through the floor: the 34D fit more like a 34B. The cups were so small. I thought maybe my size had increased, so I got myself professionally measured: still 34D. So now I have to send it back - paying the postage and the re-stocking fee. From now on, I will only purchase bras after I've tried them on!"
5,Blown Away!!,"This bra supports and uplifts those of us who are fuller-busted (34D)unlike any other that I've every tried. I was so blown away the first time I tried and purchased it at Lord & Taylor that I asked the L&T associate to never discontinue the bra. Of course they don't carry it any more, but thank goodness Amazon does. The support adds inches to my torso so all fitted/semi-fitted blouses and knits look and fit much, much better. And you can wear this seamless bra under sheer tops without concern. A great, great bra that's expensive, but worth the investment. Have it in several colors."
5,Very Uplifting! Chic Chantelle!,"This beautiful bra is available in sizes 32B-42DD. You can also get F and G cups in some of the smaller band sizes. Chantelle, being a French company has long upheld a high standard for all of their products.Chantelle products are high end, high caliber and high quality lingerie The Hedona has gently molded cups that contour a woman's individual shape and enhance her sense of feminity. It gives excellent support and will, with proper care last a lifetime."
4,At long last,"Finally a cook book that tells you how to complete the human digestive process. After your meal has been processed by your body, only waste remains. ""Cooking With Pooh"" shows you how to take that waste and recycle it into delicious treats. I had no idea that pooh could be used in so many dishes! Every recipe is low in fat although they all taste like crap."
5,Great book,"Awesome, funny, and informative. Who doesn't cook with pooh?!! My husband laughed for hours when I gave it to him."
5,Coprophiliac's unite!,"Yeah for Pooh! ""...Food and feces can't be beat, low in sugar, no red meat...""This is a must if your child has to bring in treats for class...just imagine...Teacher:'Why Timmy! These are great cookies. Did you have help cooking them?'Timmy: 'I sure did! Cooking with Pooh!'Teacher: (spits out cookie)"
4,Inspired,"Having interests in both science and poetry, I was excited to find a book about both, which was not merely a collection of ""scientific poetry"" but which actually had something worthwhile to say. The book presents a wonderful insight into the lives of three poets in particular, William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, and is enlightening as to the ways in which they responded and reacted to the increasingly science and technology oriented society they lived in. Since this trend towards a reliance on science and technology has only escalated since the 1920s and 30s it is interesting to compare their position to our own. Certainly, I have gained a new appreciation for the poetry, and a new understanding of the period. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the ways poetry is written to reflect our position as humans within a social context."
4,still trying them out,"Says they fit 2009 Audi A4 - not quite. The holes don't quite line up, by about an inch. The cut and shape is good, color and feel of the carpet is wonderful. They are soooo soft, I want to drive barefoot! It has been only 2 weeks, and they only slip a bit.If they stay put I will keep them. The price was very reasonable."
1,Very Durable But...........,"This toy chest is exactly what we were looking for. It is very large to store plenty of toys and the top detaches. The problem is it was extremely difficult to assemble. In fact, I almost returned it because the sides just wouldn't connect. After trying several times and using a hammer and sitting on it, we managed to get 3 sides assembled and it was enough to hold it. We decided to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. After all the abuse it took to assemble it, I think it will hold up to anything a child could do to it."
4,Awesome toy box,"This thing is huge,sturdy and easy to assemble. I bought two. Holds lots of toys and my kids climb all over this thing and it holds them fine."
1,Mother knows best,"Durability is fantastic, but problems with the lid made this item useless to me. The lid is large, heavy, and not attached to the box. This makes it difficult for me and all kids to manouver, and no matter how many times I put it behind the box, it somehow manages to find its way to the middle of the floor and is always in the way. Also, the chest is large with one separater to divide the it in half - no real way to organize. I found this just became a junk box. So I moved it to the garage to keep her outdoor toys in, and used another organizing system for the toys in my 3 year olds bedroom."
3,Only 10 parts but 4 of them are impossible to put together,"I liked that this was an ""easy with no tools necessary"" box but the parts that actually hold the toy box are these 4 small squares of plastic that have 4 pegs on each that are supposed to line up with the main parts and click into holes on those parts. But they don't line up without MAJOR pressure, they don't click in without hammering them really hard (thought I'd break the plastic first), and then these parts pop out indiscriminantly. I would find another one to buy as this one will annoy you as it pops out and doesn't fit together. The lid is also really heavy and can be shoved right off by my 11 mo old."
1,Disappointed!!!!!,"I had purchased the blue one years ago for my son. Now that I have 2 girls, I wanted the one in pink. I ordered it and waited to receive it. I got it when they said I would, which was great! To my disbelief, the product was dirty when taking it out of the box. Customer service worked with me and was going to give me a discount to keep it. I put the toy box together (which is not difficult), however, it would not go together right. The one end piece tab would not fit into the longer piece. This caused the toy box tabs (inside) to not stay in place. Plus, when the lid was put on it was crooked. I was so disappointed. I returned the product and now I cannot find one anywhere. I am going to have to go with a different toy box. I was let down! The girls do not care either way, but it was a sentimental thing for me."
3,Pain to build and return,"When this came it seemed like it would be easy to put together, attach the 4 walls to the base and done! boy was I wrong. The plastic pieces did not fit together at all leaving the box wobbly. Because of the size of it I decided not to return to amazon but instead called little tikes because the product has a 1 yr warranty. They said we will send a new one no problem. This process took 4 weeks. First I had to take pictures of the defective product and email them to little tikes, then once those were approved they had me deface the product with a permanent marker and take pictures and send those over as proof it was destroyed. Then 2 weeks later I got a new one. The new one works great, it is durable, large enough for a whole mess of toys and isnt an eyesore. The common theme on the reviews though were that this didnt build properly quite a few times. If you get a good one its great, if you get a messed up one be prepared for the frustration."
4,Wonderful Toy Box..........a very big pain to assemble!,"The toy box itself is wonderful, assembly looks to be a snap, it is anything but! Don't be afraid to hammer the heck out of it during assembly, that is the only way to put it together! Holds an enormous amount of toys!"
3,Huge toy saver,"Mom and Dads will love this. Makes cleaning up the room much quicker. Toy is not too fun but it helps getting my 22 month old and 3 year old to help clean up. It's all in the game you play in conjunction with cleaning up. The dividers were a good idea but not useful for me. They are in the hall closet for later. My kids love to sit in the toy box ""boat"" with and without the toys in it."
4,"Excellent product, PAIN TO ASSEMBLE!!!","Like I say, excellent product. HUGE. Stores a ton of toys. Then there's the assembly. 5 simple pieces not counting the lid. Seems simple. Then you realize there's no screws or anything like that. This company designed there own rectangular shaped plates that have these screw like tips that go into the holes in the walls of the toy chest. Problem is when you line up all the sides, the holes don't line up wht the stupid pegs!!! Anyway. I got my hammer as instructed and began to whack the hell out of the plates dead center. Despite they don't look lined up, once you whack th plates in the middle, eventually they will fall into place. A headache, but it's over. Took me about 10 mins to finish. Bottom line: Best priduct out there, but take deep breaths!"
4,Great Box,"It's just wonderful, and big enough for all my daughters toys. The dividers are a plus! Enough said!"
3,missing part,Love the toy box but a piece was missing from the box..extremely disappointed. This was purchased for a birthday gift for my grand daughters 1st birthday.
2,Doll Saver,"I bought this lovely toy box for my daughter...She use to keep alll her dolls in a pile on the floor and I got tired of finding toys all over the house,so I bought it.It has seperators so the dolls go in one spot and the big toys go in the other...It's a pretty pink and white so it matches her bedding, and there are no sharp edges on the box so it's safer for younger children...Now I'm happy cause there is no mess.This is a Great Sturdy toy box..."
1,Falls apart...,"I thought this was the cutes toy box, and large to boot! But... what good is the size of it if it will not stay together. The sides snap together and do not stay together even with nothing in it. Too bad."
3,CUTE!!,THE GOOD: BIG SIZE WILL HOLD A LOT OF TOYS....(WISH IT CAME WITH THE DIVIDERS)THE BAD: ONLY THING IS THE LID IS IN NOT ATTACHED SO FALLS OFF TO THE SIDE THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT LITTLE TIKES CAN DO BETTER!!
4,Bulky and Heavy but HUGE,This toy box is great if you need a quick place to hide toys when cleaning up. I can fit quite a bit but it's size is also a downfall. My daughter is tiny for her age (she's 15 months but the size of a 9 month old!) and she can't get the top off by herself or reach the bottom so she will whine when she sees something in there but can't reach it. I love it and wouldn't trade it in but my main goal was to be able to quickly hide her toys when cleaning up at night. It does that well. Keep in mind that the top is not attached and is somewhat awkward/heavy for kids so don't expect them to take it off and put it on with out help. At least not when they're young.
1,Disappointed!,"I love Little Tikes Products, but they didnt get me on this one. The box is huge!! awesome to have the playroom, living room and bedrooms clean, organize and also play ""cleanup"" or have a ""cleanup"" lesson with your kids. What it really matter here is how safe it is for my kids, The lid completely turns off, in the picture you'll see a girl holding the lid with one hand, i dont know how they did it, the lid is heavy and everytime my daughter (5 years old) try to open it it falls off and have crushed her fingers too. It's really a pain. We finally decided to completely removed the lid and leave it like that."
5,Define buy,I think this is one of the best products I have purchased. It is think and sturdy and the kids fill it quickly :). I love it.
3,Ok..,I liked the look of this and my sister had gotten on for her daughter so I had an idea of how big it was but the one I ordered I put together for my daughter's birthday the sides slide together almost and they have these square plastic clips that hold the joints together as much as I tried I could't get the clips to fit into the holes that were there for it the joint where the walls of the box met didn't fit right it seems as if on one of the wall that the plastic was molded to big to fit into the other wall. I still have trouble trying to get it to stay together.
3,HUGE!,"It's a good toy box, but the lid isn't attached and that's quite a pain, especially since it's so large."
2,Very difficult to assemble,"I would not recommend this. The capacity is huge, but it is very difficult to assemble. I broke one of the pieces that holds the sides together trying to get it in place because I couldn't pull the pieces close enough together. I emailed Little Tikes and they promptly sent replacements free of charge. I eventually got it assembled by using a ratcheting tie-down to pull the pieces close enough to get the connectors in. However, I noticed a couple of days ago that one of the connectors has popped out."
4,Love the toybox!,I love this toy box! It's HUGE for the price! and my 2yo daughter LOVES it!! We play the clean up game and she knows to put all her toys in it and it holds EVERYTHING!!! My only complaint with it is that the sides didn't quite line up. I had to return the first one because it wouldn't fit at all but the second one It just isn't quite a perfect match but still holds up great! Still definitely recommend!! And I would buy again!
3,"Sturdy, but issues with assemble","I've had a little tikes toy box similar to this when my son was little and loved it. I bought it this time for my grand daughter knowing that it would last a long time. My only issue was the assemble. There are 4 things that go on the inside to create the box. We were only able to use 3 of them and I'm hoping this is going to work. The 4th item didn't fit so we weren't able to use it. If it fit, I would have given 5 stars for this item."
4,Pink Toy Chest,"This is a great product, the exception is; its very difficult to assemble, it calls for he use of a hammer and if your not careful you can crack it like we did. Also it would have been better for the lid to somehow attach."
3,"Very big, but a pain to put together.","I got this for my daughter's b-day and I am happy with the sized it does hold a lot of toys and looks very nice, however it is a pain to put together. They send you these little rectangle peices you are supposed to be able to just snap the sides together with but that didn't work to well. All the pieces went in except for one. The piece was not long enought to fit into the holes for the side and everytime we tried to put it in the other ones would pop out. My husband had to find another piece of plastic like the one provided and screw it into the sides. They need to send better fitting pieces with the product."
4,GOOD,"I was at a concert the other day in congress center in Chi town:Gangstarr,Dead Prez and L.E. it was very good.I've never heard about LE but one of them throw this album in the audience and i cought it.Very good album this boys have future i think that we will hear from them soon very good groupSpecial attention to #6 Let's Ride feat.TajC"
5,Not Always PC,"The usual somewhat squirrelly delights of English country life in the early 20th century, cultural gaffes and all. Misunderstandings and happy endings all around."
1,Book in terrible shape,This book should have never been sold. It was so badly water damaged that the entire book is crinkled. I am a librarian and if someone had given us this book we would have immediately put it in the garbage so it wouldn't infect other books. It's shocking the seller offered this book.
3,GREAT SHOW - HORRIBLE SOUND,"No need to comment on the performances. These guys rock, period. The DVD production isn't good. All those effects are annoying and although I can understand where Portnoy is comming from on deciding on those effects, I think they're very amateur looking and completely unecessary.The sound is another shame in this DVD. Something as simple as compression -- yes, it's simple -- was overused and abused. I am a recording engineer and I can't believe they did such a crappy job on mixing this concert. It may have been captured wrong, maybe Kevin Shirley was drunk, who knows...I watched this DVD two times just for the sake of it but the sound quality won't let me play it a trird time.Hopefully the next DVD live in Tokio will be mixed by japanese engineers."
3,"Video Quality Substandard, And It's A Shame!!!","I love Dream Theater but this DVD is a huge letdown visually! This is a taped performance not filmed. Plus the video effects are laughable at best. I mean these are cheesy basic video editing machine tricks(mirror image, hippie like tye dye backgrounds and the like). Musically, Dream Theater are amazing, but this DVD just fails to visually deliver the power of their music and instead makes it feel cheesy which is a damn shame! Next time guys, release a DVD that is visually on on par as your studio albums are sonically"
2,Not Worth your bucks...,"Being a friend of this group since I can remember listening to music, you may safely assume I am not doubting the excellence or authority of Dream Theater here.BUT..this video must be the worst production I've witnessed since the early days of my DVD collection (back in 1999).The sound is so cluttered that feels like a monophonic recording. The High Frequencies are away on vacation and the Bass is completely messed up...Let alone the horrific graphics popping up all the time making the picture at par with the rest production, SIMPLY UNBEARABLE!!!"
5,A very master piece,"Les cuento que este DVD es genial, muy buen sonido he imagen, efectos muy bien logrados, la banda e muy poderosa en el escenario, y me animaría a decir que es una de las mejores bandas de rock progresivo. Amplio material, escenas borradas fotos e incluso la duración de todo el programa, Vale la pena tenerlo, y a todos los fans, no duden en comprarlo, un precio bastante razonable para lo que encuentras dentro.If you don't read spanish, I tell you this DVD is the biggest DVD on the earth, very good you'll see"
5,Treasure This!!,"It has taken awhile to write this review but it wouldn't have mattered when I wrote it. I love it! If you're the type to get obsessed by things you enjoy then by all means purchase this DVD ... and everything else this band has done!! Incredibly satisfying. Band like this have to exist so that younger musicians have something engaging to listen to and to be inspired by. The negative things written about this DVD are unfortunate. Dream Theater probably does more for their fans than any other band out there. A simple fix for all the whiners out there is to turn it up loud, extremely loud and enjoy. If you have all the latest audio equipment be thankful. Most of us don't so it should sound alot better for you.Congratulations John, John, James, Mike, and Jordan on a job well done!"
5,Yikes these guys are even better live...!,"This is quite possibly the best live dvd ive ever bought of any band. This dvd really beats there studio work, and really delivers the live dream theater experience. These guys are amazing musicians and this dvd shows it. They have no trouble reproducing there studio work live. Great dvd."
4,You know about the hidden feature on this DVD..?,"First, the sound on this DVD is pretty shabby. Surprising for ""Dolby Digital"" even if this is 2 channel... Glad to see someone else mentioned this. I am thinking Dream Theater needs to reissue this with full DD, 5.1 surround and do a little tweaking on the recording. Maybe even DTS?? Could we be so lucky? Should we fans start a letter-writing campaign?Heck - if Zeppelin can do what they did with 30+ yr old VIDEO AND MUSIC, DT, with more recent footage recorded with current technology, should be able to surpass LZ's amazing feat of engineering prowess. All of this talk about DT's engineer and he puts out a DVD that sounds as weak as this?!Anyway - back to the hidden feature. You can find & watch the casting call for the hypnotherapist by going to the color bars and let them run for 5-6 mins.. Fast forward & you'll see it.Have fun!Artofshredfl@aol.com"
5,Outstanding,"It took me almost a year to realize what a masterpiece Scenes was, and this DVD, complete with a hilarious hidden feature, extra songs, and commentary, just takes the cake. If you are a Dream Theater fan, it's a SIN not to own this."
4,"Goddamb, this is GOOD","Dream Theater are incredible. This video captures the essence of their phenominal live show and includes some truly killer chops from each member. The instrumental sections are probably my favorite (especially ""Dance of Eternity""), and the gospel singers included in certain numbers fit perfectly. My only complaint is probably the ecsessive amount of video clips played during each song. I suppose they're necessary for follwing the plotline (that's right, ""plotline""), but some of it was played during great parts of different songs and was just uncalled for.Other than that, this video is pretty much flawless and shows you what an overwhelming display of musicianship these five men boast."
5,Get it now,"If you have not gotten this dvd yet and like Dream Theater, why havent you gotten it yet? This is a must for all Dream Theater fans, I mainly got into Dream Theater March 2002, I got this dvd in July 2002. Despite liking Dream Theater in between and buying most of their albums during that time, I never quite understood why they were praised so much, until I actually watched them in the dvd. Anyone can easily see how they deserve the praise, Petrucci, Myung, and Ruddess move their fingers insanely fast, and Portnoy is just totally great and entertaining on drums. This is the next best thing to going to their concerts, which i did finally go to summer 2003."
2,terrible sound,"I bought this with great expectations but was dissapointed. All myopic DT fans will avoid this review, but this DVD ... The sound should be in 5.1, and loud! The volume level is very, very low. I can't believe anyone listened to this before releasing it. Also the video has way to much ""cinematic"" scenes. Just give a DVD showing this great band playing LOUD, and in 5.1!"
3,Excellent music ... sad sound quality,This music is defintely worth putting out on DTS. But having said that the DVD is worth having for the bonus material alone. Excellent performance of Voices ...
2,Great Performance. Awful sound,"I will not say anything about the band's performance, I've seen them live and they are always great however this DVD has a terrible sound mixing and also the master's volume is too low.Anyway, I think this DVD still a must have for DT fans.Maybe we could watch the DVD with no volume and use the Scenes from a Memory CD to compensate the sound."
3,Great show; Terrible DVD,"Like others have said, I give this 3 stars based solely on the quality of the DVD. The music is incredible; the visuals look like they were put together by a middle school television production class. ... give me a widescreen edition, with real stereo sound, and I'll give you five stars. I'd rather just throw the triple-live CD version of this album in the player and crank it up, because this is hard to watch with all the visual [stuff] they throw in there."
3,Dissapointed,"I love DT. This album converted me about a year ago and couldn't wait to see it live. The sound is great and it's fun watching the guys' talent showcased. Unfortunately, the video editing was about 10 years behind its time and was distracting to the performance which has kept me from watching it a 2nd time. Note to all live music show directors: Don't try and be artful! The art is there in front of you, frame it in high quality video and let the viewer enjoy :) 3 stars only."
5,The Best,"This is prog rock at it's best. At every level. If you have any incline for this type of thing and buy anything else before this, you are making a mistake. Video production dated, but this band is unbelievable on a technical level while delivering rapturous musicality. Wear a diaper and a seat belt."
5,My Mom even liked them!,"I was turned on by Dream Theater by a guy from my high school reunion. Since then, I've been watching Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York EVERY single night and find myself getting hooked more and more - I start with the cut HOME (my fav) and then go from there. The talent of these guys is truly amazing! And get this -- my Mom who is in her 70s loved them too (I took this DVD to our Christmas party and everyone was mesmorized)! I've been a RUSH fan for years (as well as the STONES) and I must say that these guys are off the charts -- what I find amazing is how right on target their rhythms are and I adore how they go back and forth - from good and slow; hard with stops - to deliriously fast. Just writing about them sends me. If any of you love RUSH - check out these guys - I think you'll find much pleasure."
5,WE WERE IN AWE WHEN WE SAW THE ATLANTA SHOW!,"IF YOU MISSED THIS TOUR, PICK THIS UP!! THESE GUYS HAVE TO BE THE BEST BUNCH OF PLAYERS EVER ASSEMBLED AS FAR AS INSTRUMENTAL VIRTUOSITY! WHAT YOU'VE HEARD'S ALL TRUE!! I DO WISH THEY'D HAVE PUT IT OUT IN 5.1, BUT IT'S A MUST-HAVE!"
3,Nice but not great.,"I love dream theater but dont understand what happened to them, Oh wait Kevin isn't in the band anymore and after that it went downhill. ...these guys went from pioneer's to followers in 4 years. Dream theater even admits to most of this in the special feature of the dvd where they provide commentary on the show. One after another they cited peices of their new music by naming names. For instance, The intro is [SO PINK FLOYD]and they say"" Ok this is like floyd"" ""This is like yes"" This part is like so and so"" All of the new stuff are parts of supergroups that they [copied]. I dont understand where the originality went. Possibly with Kevin? Everything seemed to smell of Pink Floyd, yes, etc....Thank god Queensryches operation mindcrime exists because they did it right. When you embark on a ""Concept"" album create something new, Don't take parts of everyone else's music and storyline and make a DVD. This is great footage and sound but lacks originality."
1,GOOD DVD-AWFUL SOUND,The sound of this dvd is very low and noisy.i cant really enjoy it for that reason.the other aspects of the dvd are ok.tks a lot to all the amazon reviews for warning me of this flaw!!!
4,excellent book on the culture of religion in ancient Rome,"This is a very worthy tome on the cultural history of religious life in ancient Rome. I suspect the target market comprises academics and university students of ancient history - and it is perhaps for this reason that I found the text dry, though informative and, no doubt, reliable. This is a valuable addition to my library (if it can be called thus) on ancient Roman religion. I do not give it 5 stars because I would have preferred more discussion on the individual Gods themselves (dealt with within their own topic areas)."
5,Mary Beard et al again,"The perfect match to the source book this book is also a winner, exploring the diversity and intricacies of Roman religion."
2,"Boring, unless you like to read about snow.","It's quite a while ago that I read this book, but I still remember that it was very boring. It was a real disappointment, as I'd read other works of Le Guin with much pleasure. I don't understand why it has won 2 awards. Am I missing something? I had problems getting into it in the beginning, then a very boring trek with elaborate descriptions of snow. I can't even remember how it ended. And where's the SciFi? hardly any. I gave 2 stars in stead of 1 because I think it was well written. I mean her sentences are OK, but it's their contents I not satisfied with."
2,Tedious and Dull,"I am a big science fiction fan, but I am forced to review Left Hand of Darkness in a negative light. I just can't see why this book received the great reviews it did; it was such a bore. I expected the 2 Gethen factions to go to war, at least that would have made this novel interesting. I like action in my science fiction; this book was worse than 2061 in terms of action and pace. The most annoying aspect about this novel was the tedious trek by the 2 protagonists to Karhide. That journey used at least 1/3 of the novel space! I thought I was getting my incisors ripped out when I was reading it. The only group of people I would recogmend this book to would be anthropologists due to the cultural emphasis Le Guin puts on the Gethenians."
3,This book DID NOT change my life,"The majority of people that contribute amazon reviews are devotees of the book, inflating the star rating beyond what it deserves. My three star rating may not make much of a dent, but hopefully it will give a more balanced look to those straddling the line about buying this book.The Left Hand of Darkness was a good, solid book, but it did not elicit tears at the end or change my life in any tangible way. Simply put, I enjoyed the story. It is a fast read, with an imaginitive setting and a few interesting characters (unfortunately, the main character - Genly Ai - does not number among them).This is not a sci-fi book as much as an exploration of a ""what if"" scenario that happens to take place on another planet. A fun, rainy-day Sunday book."
4,Another World,"Le Guin has created book that takes the reader to another world using imagery to paint a vivid portrait in the mind of the reader. A race without gender, such as the one that Le Guin shows us, has infinite possibilities and infinite flaws. A world blanketed by a never-ending winter that is hostile even to its inhabitants. An envoy sent to offer alliance and to be patient for acceptance.The main character, Ai, is this envoy. He is faced with an almost impossible task, he has to first convince a genderless race to accept him a male, and he then has to persuade them to accept his proposal for alliance. Ai spends his first year overcoming such prejudices and delays, and is faced with more years containing the same tediousness. He then meets Estraven, a native willing to look past the handicap of Ai's gender. Together they must succeed with Ai's mission, and they must learn to love each other, much as we must look past prejudices."
2,This women cannot write descriptively,"Despite all the awards this book has won, and somewhat interesting ideas buried within it, one does not get a real idea of what the story is about or what the characters even look like. This is some sort of psychological allagory for which the metaphor escapes me and the author."
2,Not Great Sci Fi but Well Written.,"I heard the book as an unabridged audio tape, but had trouble sticking with it. The symbolism was deep and the writing good... however, my definition of great Science Fiction is Robert Heinlein's 'Stranger in a Strange Land' or Frank Hebert's 'Dune' or L. Ron Hubbard's 'Battlefield Earth' . Maybe a world without sex roles or biases would fascinate some, but this just isn't great science fiction."
2,The Left Hand of Boredom,"I actually had to read through this whole book for an english class. Otherwise, I never would have been able to slog through this unbearably boring novel. The book was universally despised by the whole class. Some have declared it profound and thought provoking, but in actuality the book is filled with superficial new-age philosophy and pop quasi-spirituallity. Mix ""Siddharta"" and the screenplay for ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" and you get a good idea what this book is about."
2,"A Dreary, Skimpy Story","For a book that has won both a Nebula and a Hugo award, this work was gravely disappointing. Le Guin earned a star for having an interesting concept and creating some semi-interesting cultures, but beyond that this novel is deeply lacking in the story and character department. The story began alright and then became very dreary without that much pay-off in the end. Le Guin is a good writer and it makes reading this book bearable (otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish it) but it is still very lacking. The main character, Genly Ai, is not interesting at all nor are the other characters really all that interesting. I recommend that this book be avoided."
2,"Skillful prose, but not my cup of tea","I had high hopes at the start of this book: I was interested in the characters, enjoyed Le Guin's writing style, and found the plot compelling. But then, somewhat abruptly, the book effectively took a very long hiatus from the plot to explore the two main characters, the culture of the alien world Le Guin has created, and, at great length, gender issues in this hermaphroditic culture. As Lincoln put it: ""People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like."" It's a well-written and thoughtful book, certainly, but I am not among those who like this sort of thing."
3,"Not what I was expecting from an award winner, but still a good read.","Although I was expecting a little more from an award winning book, I found this still to be a good read. It was a little slow at parts with too much concentration on details not necessary to the plot line and some unfinished threads. The basic plot is good and thought-provoking and the characters are sympathetic and relatable. Would have liked it to be a little longer with regards to the ending, but it did leave you to think what the possible futures of the persons involved would be."
3,"good story idea, but not pleasant reading","The Left Hand of Darkness started with a provocative question: what would a society look like in which there is no sexual difference--more specifically, what would that society look like to a man from our own gender-conscious world? However, the book took a long, meandering path from there.The main plot line is frequently interrupted by subplots and factoids that didn't fully integrate into the story (even though it seemed to be the author's intention to do so). Moreover, too many techno-babble and jargon weighed down the prose, forcing it in the painful position between fiction and pseudo technical writing. Eventually, the main plot emerged from the mist and peaked in a beautiful emotional moment, but the reader's interest was already tried by then."
4,A pleasant read,"I enjoyed the book and thought it ended better than it began. I would put this somewhere down the middle of Science Fiction/Fantasy. If you prefer science fiction books where to plot moves quickly, you might be disappointed. For me this book didn't have the pull in plot to keep pulling me back. But it is still something I would recommend reading. It has some interesting concepts and I think the constructed world in the book is one I will remember for a long time."
5,My Favorite Le Guin novel,"Out of all of Le Guin's books I've read so far, including the Telling, The Dispossessed, Earthsea, Gifts, Changing Planes, and Coyote Girls, this book was my favorite. Although the Telling and the Dispossed are also achingly good, the stories are a little too political. At times, the messages in them distract you from the story.The Left Hand of Darkness is epic. Le Guin's prose may not be as polished as it is now, but the story is absorbing enough that you forget all about that. This is a story that makes you sit after you've finished it, to fully digest it."
1,Save your money!,"This book may have introduced some interesting concepts back in 1969, but, compared with books on similiar subjects like ""Enders Game"" by O.S. Card and ""In Conquest Born"" by C. S. Friedman, it is simply boring today."
1,"Someone wake me up, the book put me to sleep!","Yawn. And I don't care what her father did, it doesn't make this book any better or interesting. Fair warning, this book is as good as a warm cup of milk. It can cure insomnia. There is no story whatsoever."
5,A dark pearl of a novel,"What I mean by ""pearl"" in the title is that it's seamless, beautiful, and a little mysterious. It's hard to necessarily put all the pieces together with this intense exploration of gender roles, but it's a puzzle, nonetheless, that will stick with the reader for a long time to come. Ultimately, this book (as explained in the seminal introduction to this novel Le Guin provides) isn't about some far off planet in time and space. It's about US, and how we perceive and act on gender roles we've inherited. Of course, those theories wouldn't mean much if the prose wasn't sparse and vivid, the characters weren't engaging (even when extremely strange), and the planet this takes place on wasn't realistic. Thankfully, LeGuin supercedes these criterea for an excellent novel--groundbreaking when it was published, as essential as ever today."
3,Meh,"What big ideas did you find in this novel? I found it to be a rather standard Second Empire novel, with a few twists. True, there were a few moments of clarity and profundity, but I don't consider this story to be particularly exceptional. Certainly falling short of the hype. Comparing it to LotR? Really? Please.I don't know, maybe I'm dense. I wouldn't think so, with over 40 years of S-F experience behind me. But can somebody please explain to me what was so great about this book?"
4,"Good, but dark...and cold","I enjoyed this book, although I thought it was a little bit slow at times. I also thought that the setting was focused on a little too much for my liking (much like in Dune), and I wished I could have learned more about the characters, and the politics and society of Winter, instead of just the environment.This book was a little dark, and cold, but I definitely enjoyed it and will look to read more of Le Guin."
4,I don't know what else to add...,"Strange for me to think of this book as science-fiction. For me, science fiction was all about Buck Rogers and ray guns. Ursula LeGuin has changed my perceptions entirely.While the book's concept of gender may disturb some, I found the ideas insightful and the writing brilliant. LeGuin's characters suffer and live with real emotions that can only come out during a sudden storm."
3,"Great idea, so-so book","LeGuinn had a fascinating idea for this book - a world where people spend most of the time as neither male nor female, but just become one or the other (not the same each time) for mating purposes. Unfortunately, while the book gives you something to think about, there is not much of a story there, and the book is boring."
5,Still as good as ever on a re-read,"I re-read The Left Hand of Darkness last week (I'd first read it 15 years ago). It is still as emotionally, conceptually and imaginatively powerful as it was. It is one of a handful of books that made me (consciously) look at the world and human beings in a different way. You can breeze through it in a day, you owe it to yourself to read it."
3,"Interesting, although slow","I eagerly anticipated this book having heard that it was a science-fiction classic along the lines of Dune. However, in my opinion The Left Hand of Darkness has not maintained its appeal the way Dune has over 40+ years. I can understand why the book won the Hugo and Nebula awards, as the themes explored are indeed fascinating, and groundbreaking at the time. The idea of a civilization not engaged in a struggle of opposites, of 'this vs. that', is intriguing. However, the style of writing is detached, the characters are barely developed and the story drags until about two-thirds of the way through, when a journey across a huge ice cap is visceral and atmospheric. If you have an interest in Eastern philosophy, which heavily influenced this book's thematic content, and are willing to be patient, then I would recommend reading it at least once."
3,"Imaginative, but too gray and simple.","Ursula LeGuin is without any doubts the greatest author in the world, but I was not into raptures about her book, for which she made a name for herself. Although my soul did not fly to the realms, where books like ""The Word for World is Forest"" and ""The Dispossesed"" are, I will tell you that I liked this book. I recommend it to those who like profund, philosophical science fiction, not to those who like action and excitement, since the story is over-uneventful and slow, but the planet Vinter, or according to the natives, Gethen is lovely described and the white, icy vast expanses and the imaginative feature of the androgynous people of Gethen should be enough for patient readers."
1,Boring,"I've read a lot of scifi, fantasy, etc but this has got to the about the biggest waste of time that I've experienced in a long time. Single dimensional characters, plot that crawls along, just really boring. I ended up not caring if any of the characters survived.Don't waste your time, try Joanne Bertin or Melaine Rawn or Mercedes Lackey, Anne McCaffrey or even MZ Bradley."
1,Utter rubbish,"I have never read such a poor Sci-Fi book in my life, I don't know what planet most of the other reviewers are on. The book was badly written around a very weak plot. Absolutely no charaterisation at all, dull dull dull. I lost all faith in the Hugo awards after reading this trash."
4,I Love this,"I have had my Rabbit, Monty for a few years and when we got her she was a small little baby that fit in my hands but she grew so big to where shes now a large rabbit almost the size of a cat! and this cage is GREAT! she can stand, bounce around and kick her legs in excitement! its great but any bigger and definitely invest in a big hutch. Its worth the money and easy to clean if you have somewhere to put your rabbit."
4,Great review of the civil war,"I bought this book for a nice summary, but not too detailed summary of the Civil War....and thats exactly what I got. Professor Stokesbury writes this wonderful, well researched book on one the most key points in our history. After reading this book I have a new outlook on how close we were to becoming two nations. Each key battle is cleary and methodically discussed, along with some of the stuff outside the battlelines. He is very objective, not favoring either side, and explains the causes of the start and the final collapse of the Confederacy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, easy-read summary of the Civil War, or to a history buff."
3,Battle after battle,"mostly a chronological list of the battles with some background. Myself, I would have liked to have seen a little more about the things leading up to battles: politics, technology etc. But, I didn't know a lot about the Civil War before, I know more now."
4,"It was great while it lasted, which was only a week.","I bought this Sock'em Bop Buddy from Toys R Us for my 4 year old daughter as she seemed to need a safe place to channel some aggression. You can weight the bottom down with either sand or water from your kitchen sink. There were two chambers to blow up and it wasn't that difficult as long as you have good lungs. The best thing about this toy (unlike the old clown ones of the past) is that he calls out to you with each hit (he's motion activated). He says things like, ""Is that the best you can do"", or ""Ouch, that's going to leave a mark"". It was hilarious. Unfortunately though, he sprang an air leak after about 5 days (and he was sitting in my carpeted family room) and had to be blown up twice a day to keep his shape. After a day or two of that, he was beyond help. The patch that came with him was dried up and unusable, so back to the store he went. My daughter did love it though."
2,"really fun, but springs a leak too fast!","I got this for my 6 year old. It was a HUGE hit with him and all his friends (both girls and boys) because it talks back. But, like another reviewer, it only lasted a week and then got a small hole. It wasn't experiencing any more rough treatment than it's made for so that's pretty pathetic. We've patched it but it's still leaking, so sadly Bop Buddy will be heading into the trash here pretty soon. It's a bummer they don't make this more durable."
2,Three Year Old Can't Play With It By Himself,"I bought this for my three year old nephew and while he enjoys punching and tackling it, it doesn't ""talk"" unless you hit it directly on the voice activation thing, which is on top of the head, and too high for my nephew to reach (and we did pull out the tab the instructions tell you to pull out to activate this). When he plays with it, an adult has to stand next to it and hit on the head for him to hear the funny voice. Kind of lame! In addition, when you weight the bottom with water or sand, it becomes EXTREMELY heavy, so an adult has to pull it out into the middle of the room when he wants to play with it. It wasn't a bad price, and he does enjoy it, but next time I'll go for one of the cheaper, non talking bop bag toys."
2,"Fun, But Doesn't Last","Ours lasted one day and then deflated. Can't even hear any air coming out. I just think it is made poorly. BTW, this is a crazy price through this dealer. It is $20 at Toys R Us, but even at that not worth it unless you don't mind spending $20 for a day's worth of fun."
3,Great toy but it doesn't last,"My son loves this toy but we are already on our second. Both times ""Bob"" sprung a leak and broke his heart. I really wish it was a better made product."
4,Good for extra energy!!,I bought this for my son who likes to take out his extra energy on his sister. When he gets mad we tell him to go take it out on his Bop Buddy. It can withstand lots of kicks and punches. He also uses it to practice his Karate. It has been a great!!
4,Really an extended EP--& a very good one!,"With its cover typeface/color evoking Hitchcock's Ole! Tarantula, Obliteration Pie identifies itself as a companion piece--an expensive one, if you pay full import price for a disc intended for Japan. But OP isn't a ""real"" album; it's a collection of outstanding odds & ends: tasteful, restrained remakes of classics (""Madonna of the Wasps,"" ""Arms of Love""), alternate takes (a more acoustic ""Briggs""), 2 ancient videos, a live track from a classic Bottom Line performance, & strong songs available nowhere else: ""City of Women,"" ""Madelaine,"" ""My Dreams Are Scars,"" and more. Think of OP as an expanded EP and, as such, it's a pleasure: the writing & performances are wonderful."
2,Skip dessert,"Robyn has released two collections recently - Obliteration Pie, and This Is The BBC. You'll want the This Is The BBC. Update: Ok, so people haven't found this review helpful. But I didn't want to speak badly of Robyn Hitchcock. But if that's what people need: This is a terrible collection of drippy/trippy songs. It was probably released in Japan only because it was too awful to release on native-English speakers. It is really, really bad. I hope that improves the usefulness of this review."
1,bug deflector,It does not fit a 2012 Tacoma as originaly advertised. The return of product was tideous but fair. Still looking for one that fits.
4,myspace.com/barropanama,"this is the bomb! super cool documentary! must have for every graffitti/artist/new age underground counter culture enthusiast or partitioner! very good. chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club. [...]"
4,An international scope,"dvd takes the viewer on a journey throughout the world looking at some of the biggest graffitists out there. most graf dvds will only show the american output on things talking about hiphop, underground, and gang culture - however that's not what graffiti is about. it's about whatever the artist makes of it, however debatable. this dvd is highly recommended, however could show a little more about the journey and ways/craft and less about the art itself"
5,Amazing and awesome - finally the Baskervilles 2nd release!,"Midnight is driving, electric and alive. The EP is the second release from the Baskervilles and the follow up to their wonderful debut. It is full of energy and catchy lyrics. I Danced With Kate Moss is cheeky and satirical. Another Free Show In Battery Park is even better than the original from the first album. It sounds like the band does live. The Television Personalities and Bartlebees covers are great. They add a new dimension to the original versions. Midnight makes me dance around the room!"
5,Guess what!!!,"Dudes, guess what!!! Rob Keith is my school teacher. No, seriously. I'm not joking. He's my computer teacher!!! HE ROCKS!"
3,"Not bad, but a bit out of date","Instant Stitch comes with 4 CDs: Sweater Design, Organized Expressions (the inventory), a cross stitch pattern creator, and ""personal patterns for children."" The kiddie stuff didn't load properly, and strangely, seems to be for sewers, not knitters/crocheters.The inventory is exactly the program I have been looking for and, I hope, will finally allow me to catalog my stash. My one complaint is that since the software was written, many many new yarns have appeared (and others have disappeared) So I find myself calling some yarns by the wrong names, just to get them in the inventory -- alas, the upgrade from the manufacturer costs another $20!My final word? The two relevant knitting CDs seem to be an excellent value. I have no idea why the other programs are included. Does anyone want my cross stitch program?"
3,Luv it!,"I use the sweater design to design basic patterns. If you are looking for something more advanced, you may be disappointed. I don't use the children's patterns, haven't tried the crossstitch cd, I suspect it will be useful for creating motifs on sweaters. I have discovered any stitch motif (cables, lace) in the program, so I may have to buy the upgrade."
5,Lov e this bookcase,"We were looking for something sturdy and nice looking, this bookcase hit the mark. Very easy to put together and quite a bit nicer than something you'd get at a chain store. Looks very pretty in my livingroom."
4,Perfect for my son's room,"This bookcase looks just like the picture. It is the perfect size for my son's room. He is 3, and already he has quite a book collection. I had them in two large baskets, and this bookcase fit them all very nicely. The adjustable shelves made it easy for me to put the very tall books on the bottom, medium books in the middle, and small on the top. I was hoping the color would be a little deeper shade of cherry to match his current furniture; but it does the job, and his room looks so neat and organized now!"
4,A good bonus DVD for the Against Me! fan.,"The show is a energetic performance of most of their usual live material from the early 2000s. Probably not where I'd start somebody off who I wanted to get into the band, seems more like a for-the-fans little gem, but a worthy addition to their catalog and good testament to how important their live act is. Highlights include Gabel shredding so hard that he bloodies up his hand and getting it smudged on his face during Sink Florida Sink."
3,Fifty years of Barbie and Mattel still can't get it right?,"I bought this car for my three year old daughter. The front seats keep falling out and the seatbelts won't stay in place either. Also, my daughter needs help getting Barbie in and out of the car, and the ""convertible top"" is a nightmare to put back into its storage compartment. The car is listed as being appropriate for three and up, but neither my daughter nor her three year old friends can manage to play with it without getting help often."
3,Disappointing,"I was very excited to read this book because I love reading historical fiction and this subject was particularly fascinating to me. However, I was rather disappointed by this book. It seemed to move very slowly. Everyone else who has reviewed this book really loved it, but I didn't think it was that great. Rather than being unable to put it down, I was tempted to give up on it completely because it seemed like it would never end. I read all the way through with the hope that it would get better, but I never felt satisfied."
1,indian captive,it was one of the worst books i have ever read. dont read it if someone is torturing you. it is not worth it. never read it or you will be scarred for life.
1,This is a spectacular waste of time,"This book is a boring, dumb, useles, insegnifagent waste of time. DONT READ FOR YOUR OWN GOOD! I WISH I COULD GIVE IT A -5 REVIEW!"
3,Indian Captive,"Indian Captive, writhen by Lois Lenski, is a based true story of young Mary Jemison, who was taken, in the year of 1758, by Seneca Indian. A band of warriors invaded her house and took her family captive. Mary is separated from her family. They went across mountains and valleys to get to Fort Duquesne. Mary was sold to two Indian women, and was taken to their village.At the village, Mary got a new name of Corn tassel and was called Corn tassel because of her blond hair. She was miserable so she tried to runaway. She makes new friends and starts to enjoy living with Indian. She is offered a chance to go back with her family, but she can't leave her new family behind. Will she ever see her family again, or will she stay with the Indians? Read the book and find out.We give this book *** [3] and a half stars, because interesting and exciting. We recommend this book to our friends."
4,Indian Captive,This was a very good book. The book describes what is happening very vividly. It makes you feel like you are there. It especially describes how Molly is feeling when the Senica indians yell at her. This book is a good book to read.
3,Good book for someone about Mary/Molly Jemison's age,"Possibly interesting reading for a young teenage or preteen girl. Otherwise, the writing is very simplistic, often redundant to make a 'teaching' point. Thrust of the book seems to be teaching Indian methods and building a positive image, not necessarily telling Mary Jemison's story. Perfectly politically correct reading, which means somewhat sterile, but safe for all ages... if they will bother to finish it."
5,Indian Captive Rating,"I liked this book because it had a little bit of poetry in it,in one part it said that her yellow braids look like corn tusks. It gave me the image of her beutiful hair. It also showed that Indians aren't that brutle to other people. You could tell they wouldn't hurt anyone because they taught her Indian things like planting crops."
1,Indian Captive: The Story of Mary Jemison,"This is book, Indian Captive: The Story of Mary Jemison (Trophy Newbery) is a great example of people writing a book that they know nothing about. This book is full imaginary scenarios full of racist stereotypes about the Seneca culture, of which I am a part of. I bought this book thinking it would be a good tool for teaching and I was sadly mistaken. I kept feeling like the book will show my culture in a positive light but instead it only tried and failed."
2,Indian captive,"The book I read was called Indian captive. I do not think that this book was worth reading. It was long and boring. The story was about a girl named Molly who was captured by Native Americans. She began to like living with them, and when she was given the opportunity return to home, she declined.My favorite part of the book was when Molly began to learn how to speak the Native American Language. It was really cool as she began to understand. I thought it was extremely boring when the book spent chapters explaining how they did something. It was really sad when she was taken from her family. I pity her.Although this book did have some mildly interesting parts, it was overall very boring; so do not read it unless you don't have any other choice. This book was extremely tedious. It was also very sad. I would not recommend it at all. I did not like this book very much."
5,Captured By The Seneca,"Mary (Molly) Jemison lived a normal life on her farm in Pennsylvania where her family harvested corn. Her father didn't believe that Indians would ever come to their home as their neighbors said, but one day that is exactly what happened. Molly was having a normal day when a band of Indians came. Everyone in Molly's family was captured. Molly and her family had to walk for miles on end. Finally they stopped at a place where Molly was seperated from her family and was being taken with the Indians to become one of them. It was hard for Molly to adapt to her surroundings and she missed her family greatly. The Indians gave Molly the name, Corn Tassel, because of her long yellow hair. Molly was depressed at first and tried to run away a multiple of times. This book definitely a 5 star rating and it never got tedious."
4,A childhood favorite revisited with delight!,Indian Captive is a story that will make a great gift and open doors to terrific conversations. I appreciated it as much now as an adult as I did when I was a child. I loved the gentle introduction to Native American philosophy and Molly's sensitivity to the natural beauty around her even in some of the toughest times. I really felt for poor Molly as she was tugged at by two cultures. Each was described well and without prejudice. I was glad that it showed love wins over all. Lois Lenski did the classic illustrations that I remember so fondly from my childhood. A really wonderful package.
4,An insightful book,This book aims for audiences of all ages.It focus on the capture and childhood of Mary Jemison among the seneca indians.Miss Lenski has a delightful way of writting which almost makes you feel an empathy with the subject.It is also a great way to get an insight of the native americans customs and daily lives.
4,Battle of the Books,I'm in a reading compition were we read books by good authors. I can see why this is on the list.
4,Chelsea,"Do you like adventure stories about Indians? Then this is the book for you!Mary Jemison lived happily with her family... until she and her family got captured by Indians! Mary is taken away from her everyone in her family by two Seneca women. Mary hates the Indian ways! Will Mary ever get back to her family or wil she have to learn to live happily with the Indians?This book gets four stars from me and always leaves you hanging. (Just don't read the forward first, because it gives away the story.)"
5,Indian Captive Review by LEA,"This book is about an amazing (...) girl named Mary Jemison aka Molly to her family and friends. The story begins at her home in March Creek Hollow. Honestly the beginning is boring,it doesn't get really good until she gets to the Indian village at least that is my opinion. Anyway after being taken from here family she must learn to be an Indian,but how can she give up her english ways? All through the book she tries to escape only to fail time and time again but when she is given the chance to leave can she really leave the her Indian brothers and sisters? Read the book to find out!(...)"
2,not fan of long books,I did not like this book.It was way to long and it was all about Mollys mood swings and nothing else. The plot was amazing but the book was horriable writen.
2,"great story, poorly written","Reading books on early American history, I came upon several ""Indian Captive"" types that received awards. After reading 'Calico Captive' and 'Calico Bush,' I would recommend them over this title as the writing and dialogue within this title seemed unnecessarily stilted and elementary."
2,"Indian Captive- high reading level, or just plain boring?","I just finished reading Indian Captive for my language arts class, and found it extremly boring. I don't know if my reading level's low, but I could not understand this book. The reading level says ages 10 and up, but I don't see how any person younger than 13 could possibly read this book and grasp the entire meaning of the story. I thought the plot was fine (what I could understand of it) but that it used words with very difficult meanings, and it sounded like a college thesis paper. If you enjoy books that are a challenge, Indian Captive is a good find. But if you prefer understanding everything you read, I recommend staying clear of this book."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ONE,This is absolutely one of the great contemporary under-appreciated jazz groups in the US today. I was lucky to see them in NYC a few years back but I really have the feeling they stick around their hometown of New Orleans. They have never put out a bad record as far as I know and they always sound fresh!
2,Disappointing,"This book begins okay, and it's interesting to meet the characters from the previous books in the series, but about halfway through I began to get really bored. The hero is far too indecisive, the plot comes undone very quickly and the ending is so abrupt and contrived it left me shaking my head in disbelief. Ms. Johnston appears to have a hard time writing about characters who really have a dark side to them - Carlisle could have been much better constructed, but his angst seems weak. Its also very difficult to make the hero from one book the apparant villain in the next (Blackthorne), and we never do understand Cedric Ambleside's motives in this story. Too contrived, particularly the ending, and not enough real characterization."
4,A great conclusion to a great series!,"Those delightful twins from the earlier Captive Hearts books are all grown up ... well, with a bit of maturing yet to do which they will in the course of THE BRIDEGROOM. I would have given five stars but for the brutal scene in the barn for which Clay is not repentant. With his background, he should have been horrified."
5,white chocolate heaven!!!!!!,"WOW!!! If you are a white chocolate fan, you have got to try these, and with the carmel....FANTASTIC!!! I cannot say enough good things about these. I tried one, and I immediately signed up for subscribe & save, this flavor is my favorite!! The bars are small, but because of the fiber and protein they really fill you up. (Well for a snack, anyway:) And at 100 calories, you can indulge anytime with no guilt!!"
4,"Great dice, but keep away from a toddler that likes to chew.","These dice are a little bigger than golf balls. Great construction, except they are made of foam that rips if chewed. Of course, they aren't intended for chewing, so this is an fyi if you have a toddler or dog."
1,Save Your Money and Your Time,"I always try to be optimistic when reading a new title and I wait until the last page is read before forming my overall impression. With this book, it was excruciating from the first page. First, who was the editor and did that person actually read the book? If so, perhaps the person has dyslexia. I am not being sarcastic...I am being honest.Next, after the hype and buildup, the book was an overwhelming let down and disappointment. I certainly hope Mr. Ford keeps his day job because writing is not his talent.I wasted $40.00 (not cheap) and my time."
5,WOW~This Is IT!,I recieved this book in hardcover.Of all the books I have on this topic this IS by far my MOST FAVORITE.I really enjoy this guys style of writing. I highly recommend this one. Great job Mr. Ford!
1,Painful.,Complete waste of my time and money.I was not even able to force myself to finish this book.There are far better books to sink your teeth into.Winnie the Pooh for instance.
3,I suppose some of it can help you become ...,"But then again once you start coming across rituals that involve reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards, ""amen"" backwards, or the ""toad ritual"" which is suppose to have been the ritual where you can sacrifice the black cat (but the toad is more symbolic, whereas the black cat just makes you ""more hardcore"" or whatever) ...You begin to think to yourself...""Could you be any less imaginative?""I give it 3 stars because I'm sure not all of it is just chock full of shxt. Just enough to comfortably see it as filler."
4,The trilogy ends on melancholic note.,"William Faulkner wraps up the epic saga of the Snopes family by telling the story of the monstrous Mink, a convicted amoral murderer and victim of counsin Flem's conniving ways. Several other characters from various other stories come and go, allowing Faulkner to wrap up another Jefferson tale or two. As is the case with all of Faulkner's tales, the story has a deeper significance to the human condition. Highly recommended."
4,Complex and Comrehensible,"The Snopes trilogy has been a steady progression in the maturity and complexity of Faulkner as an author, concluding with The Mansion, the tragic finale piece. Less quirky and expansive than its predecessors and decidedly tragic in its inevitable downward spiral, the book offers one of Faulkner's simultaneously most complex and comprehensible studies of human nature. The characters, with the exception of V.K. Ratliff, are less likable than in previous installments, but the almost magnetic pull of the plot's inevitable conclusion is gripping."
4,Nice!!!,"This is a very nice bit of kit! I just received mine in the mail today. I'm going back to order extra ones for my wife's and friend's m500s. The stylus incorporates a ballpoint (pull off the black plastic ""butt"") and a reset pin(unscrew the stylus tip). It fits very nicely into the right-side stylus silo of my m515 with no binding or rattling. The ballpoint IS refillable (unscrew the stylus tip, then PUSH the pen tip in). There are no instructions included, I'll give the fifth star if they address this."
2,"hard to use, don't cover","I got these to draw on and paint various things such as furniture, plastic, potentially metal...My recommendation is: Don't buy them. They keep drying out after sitting for a little while and it is a long process to get the paint back into the tip (you have to push down, shake, push down, shake, scribble, push down, shake... you get the picture - for at least 10 minutes). Once you get the markers going, the paint does not fully cover and is quite uneven.I can imagine that these might be good for some specific art purposes since they do have an interesting look to them (a mix of marker and brush), but I'd consider them unsuitable for small scale graffiti, for example."
2,"Messy, and hard to use!","These oil based markers make a mess - you can't really blend the colors and they take too long to dry. I don't recommend them. The water-based paint pens are so much better, although word is that Sharpie is dis-continuing water based paint pens - I don't understand why they would, be cause the water based pens are so popular and work just great for painting anything. UNI POSCA water based paint pens are still available, though. I recommend using those instead."
5,WOW,"From the first time that I heard Bjork's lyrical vocal passages to the first time that I layed ears on her crazy outbursts, I knew she was insane. Bjork has to be one of the most incredibly talented and creative musicians of our time.This disc can in no way do justice to what Bjork is capable of, but it is a marvelous interpretation of what she has done. The disc features the cello on quite a number of tracks and also employs pizzicato and portimento techniques to capture some of the eerie sounds that Bjork uses on her albums.This is a remarkable album as a stand alone - and considering how lowsy many of the tribute albums have been lately, it is quite an accomplishment.I would recommend that everyone - from Bjork fans to John Cage fans alike - invest in this disc. You won't regret it!"
5,BEAUTIFUL COSTUME PICTURES,THIS IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC BOOKS FOR REFERENCE OF ANCIENT MEXICAN COSTUME TO SEE FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE INTERESTED IN THE ANCIENT MEXICAN CULTURE.
3,Desinging Conflict Systems,This book offers a great deal of theory and not enough real world applicability. Some of the reading is difficult to digest.
3,Can't get the flow,This book is a little wordy and that makes it hard for me to get the underline meaning. I am beginning to understand why theologians disagree so much now.
5,Christian Doctrine,This book was recommended by my associate pastor. It is an in-depth discussion of the effects the Reformation had on the church. Questions about one's own beliefs are included. The book has been used as a text for many university religion courses. I wish Mr. Guthrie were still living as I would like to ask him what he thinks the Bible says about certain changes in today's society. Fascinating book! Not a quick read.
4,A Great Base Coat,"I have deep ridges in my nails and this does a great job to fill them in. It also dries very quickly. It has a milky color so it makes your color really stand out. If you don't want to spend the money on Seche, I am just as happy with Sally Hansen Salon Manicure base coat. It also dries very quickly and fills in my ridges. It does not have the milky color but I am still just as happy with the Sally Hansen."
5,Seche Base delivers,Seche Base coat performs as promised. It fills ridges and serves as a great canvas for nail lacquer. It's irridescent and reflects light which adds to the ridgefilling effect and gives a visual effect of fewer divots in the nail. This is a solid product.
2,Pathetical and boring,"During the ""Liceo"" period of study, italian students are FORCED to read this book and to consider it a masterpiece not only of italian but even mondial literature. Well, if you've read the real masterpieces(Shakspeare,Proust,Dostoyewsky) this book will go directly into your waste basket."
1,Not the full book!,I ordered this product thinking it was the full book. Nowhere does it indicate that this was a very condensed version. It was not useful to my daughter who needed the complete book for a report.
1,ripped off,"I'm sure this book is wonderful as many of my friends have wholeheartedly recommended it. However, Amazon did not send the entire book, but only the first part! When I tried to contact them on the internet, there was no real option for a complaint such as mine. The only option was to return the book at my expense. I didn't want to return the book - I only wanted the rest of it!!! Then, I did find a place to make a comment and I did so, but never heard back from them!"
4,We just Loved this DVD!!!!,"My Husband and I bought this DVD as an alternative to paying forExpensive prenatal classes. The DVD is really informative we just satIn front of our big screen in our living room and watched 1 segment atAt a time ( about 9 segments). Shari is a midwife so mostly talks from a midwife's (all natural) point of viewBut dose acknowledge the fact that all women will not birth all natural or give birth in a birthing centerIn my opinion this DVD is really good and is a great alternative to child birthing classes she goes overEverything nutrition, breathing, exercises, breastfeeding, complications just to name a few."
1,This book is weak,"This book was a disappointment. It is as if the author spent a few weekends at the library reading every article every written about the Beasties and then condensed them. Although the author claims to have met the band members, this book reflects no intimate connection with the band or anyone who's a part of the scene and knows how things really were. Everything Angus writes references the magazine article he learned it from instead of actual conversations with the band or people who knew the band. In addition to its superficiality of content, the book's writing is poor. The author's over insertion of esoteric vocabulary words comes off as amateurish instead of sophistocated and clever. Despite it's research paper texture and pretentious writing,this book is somewhat redeemed because it is the only Beastie biography published and contains many interesting factoids about the band's history. So I would reccommend reading it if you are a fan but don't expect too much."
5,Napoleon Hill's Opus - My Good Fortune,Napoleon Hill wrote this in the 1920's and it is still relevant today. Even more so than many recent success books. Hill dissects the elements of success to show the reader a clear path to changing the way they view the future and their place in it. I have been changed by Hill's insights.
5,The law success,This is the must have book to succeed in business if you intend to become wealthy. Anyone in a MBA class should be required to read this guide to wealth.
5,The Law of Success in Sixteen Lessons,I sent this as a gift and my sister really loves it. Very matter of fact. She listens to at every opportunity. I will order one for myself.
5,the success story,This booke will give the keys that will enables all humain being to succed irrespective of their field.A must read book.
4,The Law of Success in Sixteen Lessons,"The book was written in 1929 when a paycheck of $100.00 a week was a lot of money and radio was considered leading-edge technology. Keeping that in mind, the book is an interesting and educational read. The Sixteen Laws of Success in the book are timeless and relevant even today."
5,Law os Success,I have not read book yet. It is a huge bookI am still reading other books. Love to read and am anxious to starting this book soon.Thanks
3,It is ok,"The book, has a lot of common sense information, which is useful to refresh. However I felt that the author over explains things, and goes from one place to another, he wants to express a lot of information. In my opinion he could have cut some parts, and be more straight forward. I had to force myself to finish each chapter because I was losing interest due to the overflow of information."
1,"Not Complete, nor Unabridged","I just received my copy a couple of weeks ago. Part of an assignment for my mentoring group was to gather with a group and read the first lesson aloud. I was stopped several times during my reading because my version read differently than the versions of several others (their versions were from the Napoleon Hill Institute) I soon began to see a trend: It seems that BN Publishing has seen fit to remove every reference to Jesus Christ in their ""complete & unabridged"" single volume. So, do not expect to read all of the author's words in this volume. Napoleon Hill has been censored."
4,In Great Condition,I ordered this book for my son who is IB Student. It is one of 3 on his summer reading list. We were unable to get it at the library so my wife located and ordered on Amazon. The book is in great condition and my son is already half through it. It was accompanied by a nice note from the seller. We are really happy with this purchase.
2,not what i expected,"This review is not against the book itself, but more towards the seller. I was disappointed when I received only one of the books in a two volume series. It was not listed that my purchase was for one book alone. Other vendors were selling both books for the same price."
1,Worse Poor Customer Service Ever Received,This was the worse experience I have ever received since shopping with Amazon. I have written the vender several times and have never heard back from them once. I never received the product that I ordered. I needed this product last month. I was instructed by Amazon to wait this entire time for nothing. And people wonder why this country is going down the drain.There is no such vender named: MBTextbooks
2,Not impressed,"This book shares anti-christian views. I think the authors rabbit trails too much rather than stating the basis of his point. Due to the date this book is written you have to screen what is applicable for today which would be typical.Take the parts that you feel applicable, but screen the parts that are not."
2,Too Much to Swallow,"This highly touted book did not appeal to me at all. The lessons are depressing, overbearing, and contained too much negative information for me. Each ""lesson"" leads me to feel that I will never be able to turn my circumstances around, and I get upset just thinking about picking it up and resuming reading it. The ""lessons"" are just too harsh, too time consuming, too much work, requiring time and focus that a busy career woman just does not have. Obviously written by a man, for men. Maybe I'm just not ready for it. Not one of the ""successful"" people mentioned in the book by the author is a female!!! Go figure!"
5,the law of success,"great book, but than again all of his books are awsome!Not alot to review considering that I downloaded to my phone to read."
3,The Same As Think and Grow Rich...,"...Damn, I bought this book because a friend of mines informed me that Napolean Hill had written this book BEFORE Think and Grow Rich, and that it contained the original blue print to Money and Success. OK, he was right, it does...BUT so do THINK and GROW RICH! I gave the book a 3 star rating because the information is contained in several of Napolean Hill's writings. The book comes in a 2 volume set and is well worth the money ($19.95) for both volumes. The book contains scores of life lessons and examples, and will take some time to read. I will not recommed this book if you have THINK AND GROW RICH or THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH by Wallace D. Wattles...... (BOTH BOOKS ARE ALL YOU NEED FOR SUCCESS and MONEY) Everything else from any contemporay auther is Plagarism...Both Books were published in the early 1920's."
5,A Classic,"I first read ""Think and Grow Rich"" years ago. This is written by the same author, Napoleon Hill. I re-read this book because I always learn something new. I learned again that enthusiasm is one of the key elements in selling, as well as being likable. I took these for granted, but now I consciously apply these principles. The biggest factor in my performance was self control. Again, Hill reminded me to not lose control when someone doesn't buy.Most salesmen, when you want to think it over, get rattled and get nasty. This book is extremely worthwhile, loaded with good advice and true stories."
5,The Law of Success in sixteen lessons; Napoleon Hill,"As an entrepeneur I'm always looking for information on business and mind sets for success. I've have been looking for the law of success off and on for years. I finally resorted to Amazon for the book and there it was . I was so exstatic, I could hardly wait to get it and read it. This is the definitve book that the big business of the time didn't want published after they read it. The ultimate recipe of how the leaders of the big businesses thought and worked. All the inticacies of what they did, how and why. Any serious entrepeneur should have this book in his reference library. Respectful regards,stephbanko@yahoo.com"
4,great book,this is an awesome book.. the precurser to Think and Grow Rich. I am using it in a classroom and the students are enjoying it as well
5,Great Read,This is definitely the most thorough book I've ever read on success. I see why Napoleon Hill's teaching is timeless.
5,A Cornucopia of wisdom!,"Napoleon Hill is one of the best writers and leaders on success and personal achievement of the 20th century and beyond! Every time I finish one of his works I turn around and buy another. The material covered in this book is just top of the line; there is no other way to say it. If you are really serious, I mean if you really want to take control of your life and start producing, then get this book because it is a virtually cornucopia of wisdom on how to!(...)"
5,The Law of Success In Sixteen Lessons (2 Volume Set),"In one word: inspirational.It is more motivational than most self-help books out there. Hill gives the basics in a clear language, there's no doubt what you should do next to move ahead.This is not for the practical seeker - it's for those who need that push to action. And, unfortunately, as we look at the world today - most of us need that push."
5,Little Genealogy,"James Marion Horn is my grandfather's (Bonnie Robert Little) cousin. His detailed genealogy book concerning the Horn, Little, MacDonald, and related families is fascinating from several perspectives. Not only does his work provide great detail about the families, the fact that he was able to gather this detail in the 1920's and 30's is very impressive.I own a copy of the book, but it is the only copy that anyone in the family knows about. I would be interested in purchasing another copy if there is one available."
2,A lot of wasted paper,"This book sounded great from the reviews and the ""Look Inside"" preview, - - - even though it stated that the pages were from the paperback version.What was not mentioned is the actual size of the text. The pages are 9 x 6, BUT, only an area about the size of a 3 x 5 index card is printed on each page. This may have been the size of the original book page? since this is a reprint, but it was quite a surprise when I opened the book I had purchased and realized the 214 page book was only going to contain about half of the content that a normal book that size would contain. The letter reproduced in the introduction is so small, I can't read it with a 3x magnifying glass. I have read about 15 pages so far and it seems historically compatible with other accounts of the events covered, So my advice is buy the paperback version of this book OR another title dealing with this subject matter, that will be easier to read."
5,A very much appreciated book,This really is a very fine overview of the art of shadow puppets and I have been looking for something like this for several years. I also appreciate the detailed discussion of the way that the puppets are made and something of their history in various countries. I am very happy to find what I have been looking for.
2,"love the movie, hate the transfer","Royal Wedding is a minor Astaire movie, not even up to Easter Parade, but his dancing was (as always) just amazing. The scene where he dances with a coat-rack is one of my favorites from anyplace (and is clearly an inspiration for Mel Gibson's dance in ""What Women Want"" -- Mr. Astaire does it incomparably better...).Jane Powell is too chirpy, but they have a very good number together (""How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You When You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life?""), and she can sing and dance. Sarah Churchill (as the love-interest), on the other hand, is really wooden, and the entire subplot with her family is dull.The real problem is the transfer to DVD. I think that took a worn-out tape from a rental store, left in the trunk of a car for a month, and then made the transfer. It looks terrible. It only cost a few bucks, so I expected it to be poor, but I'd love for some reputable people to release it -- I'd buy it again."
2,Poor quality,"We were able to watch the DVD, but it was not enjoyable. We had to adjust the volume on the television very high just to hear the dialog. The color was poor and the picture skipped. From the other reviews that I've read, it doesn't appear that there is a decent version of this movie available."
4,"Good songs, dancing but a boring story","The story is boring and slow moving.The best scenes are where Fred Astaire appearsto dance on the walls and ceiling of a room andthe ""Too Late Now"" and ""I Left My Hat In Haiti""numbers."
2,"Fine Movie, Horrible Print","Everyone who's interested in this movie has probably seen it many times. Not much of a story, as usual, but great dancing. It has the classic numbers with Fred dancing on the walls and ceiling and him dancing with a coat rack.However, if you think you'll get higher quality video and sound by purchasing this DVD, think again. The opening credits are crooked -- on a 10 to 15 degree slant. The picture is muddy and washed out, and the sound is muted. It's as if someone taped this off a TV broadcast and then transferred the tape to DVD. Very disappointing.I really wish we could get some of Astaire's great color movies (The Band Wagon, Silk Stockings, Funny Face) released in a high-quality DVD format similar to the quality of the DVD version of Singing in the Rain."
4,This is a True Classic!,"Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are very convincing and highly amusing in this classic flick... ""Royal Wedding."" It's a fun movie about a brother and sister dance team that bring their act to London during the same time that the Royal family is making wedding plans. The whole movie is full of fun romantic mishaps and goofy happenings! The quality of this DVD isn't spectacular, but it's really not that bad. Definately worth the money! This DVD made a great addition to our home library!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! VERY POOR VIDEO AND AUDIO! IT LOOKS LIKE A COPY OF A VERY LOUSY VHS VERSION
1,"Beware this ""bootleg"" DVD","ROYAL WEDDING isn't on DVD yet. That's because the OWNER of the film, Warner Bros. hasn't released it yet.But several other companies have, under the ""guise"" of public domain. The original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the Library of Congress, so the film is perceived to be public domain, although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these ""bootlegs"".The companies make the money, because they're selling OTHER people's property.The people who ultimately suffer are YOU, THE CONSUMER, unknowingly buying products of inferior (worse than professional VHS) quality, thinking you're getting the real thing, because it's a DVD.Save your money. Wait until Warner Bros. gives us the real thingthing...And by the way, the movie gets 4 stars, it's the cheapo bootleg DVD that gets 1 star!"
1,Awful Edition Of This Movie,"Amazon sent a special message saying this edition was available at a rather high price and I assumed it was a new remastered version. How wrong I was...this edition is awful, the images too dark, the color all wrong. Amazon should not be promoting this edition...a complete waste of money. How does one complain to amazon and ask for their money back? Don't buy this product and be taken for a ride...total waste!!!"
2,just okay,"i love fred astaire so he was the only reason i liked this movie. but if you want and/or need a good fred flick fix, skip Royal Wedding and watch Daddy Long Legs with Leslie Caron or Funny Face with Audrey Hepburn."
1,A Disatisfied Customer,This is the first item purchased from Amazon that I was less than satisfied with. I found the DVD of poor quality and the last two tracts were not visable.
2,"Nice dancing and music, but very dull","This movie would have been a complete failure if Fred Astaire hadn't starred in it. I found it to be exceptionally dull. Except for ""I Lost My Hat in Haiti"" and ""You Are"", and footage from the actual wedding of a member of the British monarchy, this film is pretty terrible."
2,Good movie ruined by bad transfer,"I'll never understand why the major studios allow dinky little production companies to release their movies on below standard DVDs. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but the horrible quality spoiled it for me. The color is muddy; in nighttime scenes, any one wearing dark colors pretty much fades into the surrounding scenery. The sound is uneven; I had to turn the volume way up to hear the dialogue, then quickly turn it back down with the music started. There are pop and skips in the soundtrack, and the picture is very scratchy. I would not recommend purchasing this awful edition of such a wonderful movie. Wait for a studio restoration release."
1,"good film, lousy copy","This is an excellent Fred Astaire film but avoid this DVD as it looks like it was badly made from a poor video tape, probably taped off of TV. Surely the studio can't let one like this languish in the vaults! But avoid this one."
1,OK for certain dance scenes,"If you want to just have Fred dancing with the coat rack and the bit between he and Jane Powell doing ""Dirty Rotten Liar"" then you're OK. But the beautiful song she sings to Peter Lawford is so dark you can't even tell who they are. Really bad DVD!"
2,Entertaining Fred Astaire film. Poor DVD transfer.,"ROYAL WEDDING is STANLEY DONEN'S first film production and truly, he hits a bullseye with this very entertaining Fred Astaire musical. One of the most famous scenes in the history of Hollywood is here, when Fred Astaire dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel suite. An amazing, ""how did they do that?"" moment.But what ruins this movie is the God awful DVD transfer. This was a TECHNICOLOR movie when it was released in 1951. To look at it on this DVD you would never know it. The colours are faded, unnatural,and hard to look at. The audio is passable but muted. A real disappointment.I didn't realise ROYAL WEDDING was in the public domain. This means anyone with access to a film print and movie projector can offer a DVD. I thought I was buying a MGM studio issue when the reality was otherwise. This print is either a 16mm duplicate or a worn out theatre print.CAN'T ANYONE PUBLISH A DECENT DVD OF THIS MUSICAL CLASSIC?"
2,Great Movie - Very poor technical qualities.,"I heard that a new digitally restored version of ""Royal Wedding"" was being prepared. When I saw the price for this DVD, I thought this was the long-awaited digital restoration. Wrong!!! It has the same woefully inadequate sound and visual qualities of the other DVD versions of this movie. Keep waiting. One of these days this fine movie will get the quality reproduction it deserves."
2,A Royal Disappointment,"Astaire, as always, is brilliant. Jane Powell and Peter Lawford are charming but Sarah Churchill is a bit too stiff and awkward to play opposite Astaire. This a good movie ruined by an incredibly poor transfer to DVD. As much as I admire the MGM musicals it saddens me to see this film represented in such shoddy fashion. The VHS copy I once owned seemed far superior in quality. Best to forget this DVD regardless of the low budget price."
1,DVD version is a waste of money,"Other reviewers have commented on the poor quality of the Madacy version of this DVD. I recently bought the one produced by UAV Entertainment and found exactly the same problems so I suspect they may be one and the same pressing. Anyway, don't waste your time on either version - clearly a very poor transfer from inferior stock: lousy sound quality, poor colour, lots of compression artefacts, and badly repaired breaks in the film. This kind of work gives DVDs a bad name, and would be unacceptable even in a VHS version.Oh, as to the film itself, a couple of good dance numbers, but so weak that I could only recommend it for diehard Astaire fans."
5,As good as the first!!!!,"This writer is a genius!! His storytelling is superb! I read the first Mummy and then saw the movie. I have read many movie adapations and by far, he is the best adapter of them all. When I heard this one was being released, I immediatly bought it. And as with the first, was never disappointed. He expresses wonderful emotions throughout. His descriptions of the events and how the characters look and feel is incredible!! I am already looking for other books by this author! Another thing about how he writes, you don't feel disappointed when you see the movie. I feel weary reading the book first, before the movie. But never get disappointed! A MUST read for ANY mummy fan!!!!!"
3,disappointing,"I enjoyed Collins' novelization of the previous MUMMY movie, and figured this one was a safe bet. The story and characters are conveyed well enough, and there are moments of insight and genuine artistry. Alas, I was left feeling that it lacked the polish of the first novelization. Mantra-like repetitions of ""puzzle-like tattoos"", ""golden mask"", ""obsidian-covered book"", and ""black blunt-cut hair"" were distracting and should have been trimmed. There also seemed to be less depth to the narrative. Not a bad job by any means, given the unforgiving deadlines and other difficulties associated with adapting a script to prose form, but a mixed bag."
2,Stick with the movie!,"Realizing that the screenplay was written first, I expected the book to follow the movie rather closely. It felt as though this book was written not from the final script, but rather from an early draft. Mr. Collins' novelisation follows the movie closely in the area of plot only. Not many of the classic movie lines were actually in this book (very disappointing). Not many lines altogether matched up with the on-screen version. The novel portrayed Rick O'Connell to have more of an Indiana-Jones-cynical sense of humor, rather than the casual humor shown on screen. Almost the entire portrayal of the O'Connell's son, Alex, was off: Collins portrayed him much younger (and maybe more of a real-world 8 yr old); his spunk didn't shine through as much as it did in the movie.Depth was missing in this novel. Characterisation was also off. If you're looking for a way to ""relive"" the movie, or see it in more detail, skip the novel and watch the movie again."
3,"A Very Exciting Book, Just like the movie.","The Mummy Returns was a very excellent book. If you like a book that gives you excitment, thrill, and a surprise ending you'll love this book.This book takes you back to Egyption times and relates it to the present. The Mummy Returns is a sequil to the excellent movie The Mummy. This wonderful book deals with Egyption Kings and queens who are trying to over power normally people who diddn't know that there dreams releated them to an Egyption queen Nefertiti. They find out they have to fight to save the world. The book is mainly about people trying to over power each other, who loves who the most, lies, fighting, flesh crawling bugs, killing,and kidnapping. The book starts off norammly but then it takes a turn for the worst but that is when the excitment gets going and just when you may think it is over it is just getting stareted. Over all this was an excellent book and I hope you enjoy it too."
4,Damon doing what Damon does...,"...and what Damon does is record good stuff. If you are familiar with Brother Cane, this disc will come as no surprise. If you are not familiar with Brother Cane and you like this disc, then I HIGHLY recommend you check them out (especially Wishpool and Seeds).Regarding this disc, it's excellent. If you like good rock, look no further.Worth buying for: Abyss, Walk the Line, Ruby Wednesday, Will you be thereIcing on the cake: Stigmata, Slave to the System, Ragdoll, Leaves, Cruze Out of Control, Live this LifeCould have done without: Disinfected"
2,A mediocre effort,"I bought this Cd only because so many reviewers here gave it 4 or 5 stars and i thought 'ok, i should give it a try'. Already after listening to it for 15 minutes I knew that it would be going like this on and on and on. Wake up people, it's probably a nice attempt to produce something worthy but it failed. Based on my own tastes in music (I listen to many different things but my favorite bands are Iron maiden, Black Sabbath, Dream Theater, Yes, Rush, Fear factory, etc.)I can predict that people who share the same musical interests will never like anything like this CD as it is just tooooo boring and flat -- nothing happens there musically. Think about bon jovi and this kind of stuff and you'll understand what this slave to the system is like. So, my verdic is that the only cool thing about this band is its name, it was supposed to be a teaser I think. It is only worth 2 stars."
2,Uninspired. Tracks all sound the same.,"I am a big fan of some of the more psy and goa trance, esp. Voyage into Trance, and some pieces mixed by Digweed etc., so I was very excited about getting this. You do get 4 CDs for the money, which are all aesthetically great--each one a different color with art work, but none of the tracks stand out at all. You can definitely keep it on as background music, but overall I was disappointed. I found no stand out tracks at all that were really fantastic or inspired. Nothing made me want to get up and dance or go running ... or anything. No real cool sounds of spaceships, sea gulls, alien announcements ala Planet Love, etc. that I can recall! Probably better to keep searching through Oakenfold and Digweed CDs for the really amazing pieces."
4,Not as nice as Boppy but good for travel,"The pillow has some nice features but overall just isn't as comfy for me or my son as my Boppy nursing pillow. However, as a travel pillow it certainly works as intended.Pros:When deflated is nice and small for travel. You can detach the back rest and leave it at home if you want it even more compact.Easy to inflate/deflate by mouth (they give you a hand pump too but that defeats the small size for travel purpose).Wipe-clean pillow (after you remove the cover) is nice for travel, and just in general.Fairly decent size and shape for nursingCons:Not nearly as comfy - baby tends to roll off to the side for some reason. Also not as cushy, and if you don't put as much air in it just bulges in the wrong spots rather than getting any softer.Little bit of a plasticky smell - the material is basically like an inflatable pool toy.Basically I wouldn't get it instead of a traditional nursing pillow but as a supplement for travel it does the job."
5,Back confort for the mom,"The quality of this prooducto and security that gives the baby are great, all pieces can be washed and not lose their shape. My baby loves it and my back too"
3,It's ok,At first I was so excited to purchase this item and then when I started using it I like the comfort but deflating it is so hard and it takes day for the air to go out of it so now I just leave it with the air in it
3,Ok,"Its good but the back pillow leaked air within a week of use so I could not use it. The pillow to rest the baby was good, gave enough space to lay the baby on it."
4,Great intro to bioinvasions,"I found this book to be a refereshing look at biological invasions. It takes in not only ecology but social factors, such as regular folks who have to deal with these pest species.I feel this book is a step up from other popular-science books on the topic, such as Out of Eden by Alan Burdick."
1,not a great fit. Be careful about sizing.,It gives nice separation. Good fabric. Be careful about sizing. I felt it was a size bigger in cup than other brands.
5,This is the best book out there!,"If you are an Absolut fanatic, like myself, this book is definetly for you. I bought two books so I could cut out each ad, front from one book and back from the other, and cover my walls. This book also tells you where the ads come from and a little more historical stuff like that. My particular favorite is Absolut Billards. So if you are absolutely into Absolut, or wish you were, go out and get this book. It's on the highly recommended list!"
5,Absolut Book: The Absolut Vodka Advertising Story,Absolut is one of the best selling vodkas in the world and the advertsing for it is second to none. In this fabulous book were are told the inside story behind the marketing and selling of this tasty treat. The paper is first grade and the pictures are outstanding to say the least. Absolut original with a bottle looking like a Roman ruin is probably my favorite one but there are so many nice advertising ideas that have become stupendous posters. Absolute Enivironment is also a nice one. This is a good coffee table book and a nice gift for the person that likes vodka and to read.
1,"""new"" apparently means ""used""","I ordered this book -- the new version -- twice. Both times, I was sent a used copy. I gave up after that.I'm sure the content of the book is great, but I haven't had a chance to see it yet."
5,the absolut killerbook of the year.,"You have a very good feeling when holding this fine piece of art in your hands. Must serve as inspiration for other designers in the future. The quality, humor and ideas are mixed into a fine dinner and will be rememberd. thanks."
5,Absolutley Fabulous!!!!,This is book is absolutley fabulous (no pun intended). I've been tearing these ads out of magazines for years now and have them all over my walls. Who knew so many others were doing the same? The book is filled with almost 500 of the ads explaining how most of them were shot or created. It is a definite must for Absolut fans!!!!

2,I saw better,"Great ideas for a book, but I would'nt buy. Somebody who would pay 20$ for that book would be crazy in the head. Anyway"
5,Perfect Purchase,"I am very happy with these sporks. I was going through tons of plastic ware at work and feeling very guilty about it. These are inexpensive yet very durable. If I lose one, I won't be too upset. I would recommend these to others."
4,"Good product, light and exactly what you need.","I was happy with this item, my only comment would be I wish they had made it 1"" longer, it would make a big difference for larger hands and for stirring food pouch. Would recommend for hikers."
4,Decent,I like this product but when you eat with the fork you likely will cut the inside of your cheek. This are nice for camp/picnics/lunches... Personally I would look for one without the knife on the utensil.
4,Great product,I saw these sporks and thought of my daughter and how much fun she would have while she eat with them. I found that she really rather play with them. She likes the colors and I like the price for the set of 4 and not for one.
3,Be aware it may break,It does it job until it breaks. There are plenty of accounts of the spork breaking in the middle. One of my sporks did create a major crack during a backpacking trip but with careful usage it lasted. But it's not very calming if you take only one spork along on an outing by yourself where you rely on your spork to cook and eat.Another spork developed a chip at the edge of the spoon. It works fine but isn't comfy to your mouth while eating.The most useful part is the spoon. I haven't really used for fork or the knives part of the spork during any of the backpacking or camping trips. If you really want/need to cut stuff you'll probably take a pocket knife along.The spork is still a bit to long to fit inside my cooking pot and is barely long enough to eat out of a freeze dried meal pack (longer would be nicer for that).
3,Light My Fire Spork 4-Pack,I am glad I have 4 of them. I like the design. Light weight. Unfornutately my green one broke in half on the first use while starting to eat a pot pie.Would buy another.
3,"Love them, but one is already broken!","I recently purchased a 4-pack of sporks from Amazon.com. I used two of them on a recent week-long trip to Yellowstone National Park and found them extremely useful. I agree with previous reviewers; if you are right-handed the knife part irritates your hand when you are using the spoon. Now I am traveling around the world for the next 8 months and brought 2 of them with me on the trip. I have only been traveling for 1 week (in Australia) and already one of the sporks has broken in half. I hadn't even used it yet! It was packed in my carry-on bag with my laptop, so I know it hasn't been dropped or crushed/stepped on. I really expected them to be more durable and hope that the 2nd one holds up longer than the first."
3,"Good for lefties, but not righties","These sporks have served me well in the back-country for years as they are light, versatile, and easily cleaned. I would possibly caution the right-hander who is looking to buy these utensils, for the serrated knife edge of the spork cuts into the hand with using the spoon part and into the lip when using the fork part. It has never actually cut me or hurt me, but it would be a nice feature to simply change the serrated side around. It is just about as easy to bring a few separate utensils, but if you don't mind this small annoyance then this is a great product."
2,"ouch, that sorta hurts...","I don't often write reviews, but my disappointment with this item should be noted. I bought this to go camping with. The colors and utility of these little guys make them pretty neat. The problem I ran into was the serrated edge of the fork-side. When putting something in your mouth with that side, its easy to tear the corner of your mouth a tiny bit... but if you're eating more than one mouthful, it can be painful before you realize what you're doing. A little complaint, for a little product."
5,Really nice to havve,"It's a spoon no, it's a fork, It's nice. Although I find the cutting edge of the fork a little annoying. So I softened it with a hot iron.. Works great now!!"
5,Perfect for work,Fabulous for taking lunch to work. We bought the 4-pack and shared it with others. The colors are also fun.
4,Sporks,The spork works well when packing a lunch for work. Side of the fork works for cutting up light foods. This spork keeps me from using plastic spoons& forks in the breakroom. Lightweight and streamlined. I like them!
3,Different Color,"They are lovely sporks, but the color is not a nice medium grey/blue - it is distinctly a dark, navy blue."
1,Not for everyday use,"I spend a lot of time in the outdoors, and I have seen tons of people using these sporks. They're cute and seem like they should work well. However, just a few months after purchasing them, two of the four have snapped. I wouldn't recommend relying on these to work."
4,Would have been a 5 but...,"But when i opened the package they were shipped the ""sporks"" had a black tar/oilly substance on several of them threw them in the dishwasher a couple a times to be sure. shipping was real fast too."
5,Great Light Weight Camping Gear,Sporks coupled with Squishy bowls make for great light wgt backpacking gear on BSA troop camp outs. Also supports Leave No Trace..
3,wont order any more,ended up breaking two out of the four so far this year under normal use. wont order any more. broke them eating food out of bowls.
5,they are great,the colors are terrific and they feel sturdy and they are perfect to keep in the car or give as a gift.
5,The New Spork in my Life,"I originally bought a titanium spork. She was kind of a rich be-otch, but I took her camping and traveling and she really held her own. A few times, I even smuggled her past TSA security. We were inseparable, but then one day she was gone. :(I was feeling kind of blue when I found my green Light My Fire spork. Soon, she cheered me up with some Ben & Jerry's and now we travel everywhere together.I used to think that if my spork didn't come with a hefty price tag, I didn't want to be seen with her. But I've come to love my new LMF spork's simple unpretentious ways."
1,only 2 left,tines on the fork have broken off and now I just have a short spoon. One of the walmart item 0002096855079 lasted 4 months of everyday use.
1,Love 'em until they break!,"Smart design and colors though the price is a bit steep, especially since they will break sooner than later. BTW, polycarbonate is specifically meant NOT to break, so this is essentially a defective (too brittle) polycarbonate. I buy these instead (and they never break):Coleman 16-Piece Polycarbonate Cutlery SetThat's under $8/set if you have Prime membership.Note that the big box department stores usually carry these sets, and the big box sport stores often carry similar, individual, high-quality polycarbonate utensils for under a buck each."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought these because I am a flight attendant and I need non-metal silverware to go through security. I bought the BPA free ones thinking that they would be even better for my health. Sadly, within 3 months all 4 had snapped in half. When each one broke I wasn't even using them to cut. I was doing simple actions like stirring food. I will continue to look for a new solution and I suggest that you not waste your money on these and they simply are not durable."
3,"A spork, not a knife","So these are lightweight which is nice, but the knife is just stupid. It should be obvious; if it was a good knife you wouldn't be putting it on the side of the fork which is put in your mouth. Still, they are lightweight and handy. The multi-colored variety pack is nice because you can keep track of YOUR spork when camping with a group."
1,Too many broken sporks,"These sporks seem great at first. However, I have broken way too many of them (4). They are too brittle and fragile. Perhaps not at first, but it is only a matter of time before this thing breaks in half, and then you are left with a spoon and a fork. All of my buddies who have tried these in the past have had similar results. I even found one shattered into a million and one pieces inside my checked luggage on an airplane. what the f! They are sold in 4 packs for a reason! I have resorted to titanium."
3,"Good, but dangerous","These work as advertised. It's nice to have a full sized fork to work with, as well as a full sized spoon. This gets rid of the worst of all worlds that is a traditional spork. Be aware that on the fork size, there is a little plastic knife. My wife ended up lightly cutting herself on the lip because she was not aware of this while using the product for the first time."
4,I like my spork!,"These are great. I keep one in my kids lunch boxes and they never have to be without whatever utensil they need. And they're ""school safe"""
5,I love my Sporks!,"I plan on stocking up on these, in all their forms - multiple colors, titanium, large and small. Come the Zombie Apocalypse, I will use them for trading and as gifts to the less prepared. They're also handy for non-zombie situations, such as camping. I have used them multiple times during camp cooking and they are nigh indestructible."
5,useful and easy,"I'm a college student, so this came in handy. I can make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with only one utensil! Also, everyone who sees them thinks that they're super cool."
4,Splitface,"Dick Tracy, Detective is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on December 1, 1945. Morgan Conway is the second person to portray the famous detective. In this movie the killer goes by the name of Splitface; who is not an original Dick Tracy comic strip character. Splitface is killing the jurors who sent him prison. It is up to Dick Tracy to find and to rescue Junior and Tess Trueheart from Splitface. In this B movie, Pat Patton is portrayed as a smart and not helpless sidekick to Dick Tracy. The movie version stays true to the comic strip. Dick Tracy, Detective gets a B+."
5,my favorite novel,Every once in a while I pick up The Lost Stepsand savour it again. Each paragraph is a magical adventure.Reading The Lost Steps is like taking a mystical journey into the soul of Latin America. Harriet de Onis's translationcaptures the magic.
1,The Lost Steps,"This book is perhaps the most horribly pretentious work of literature I've ever read. Some people write books out of passion or a desire to express emotion. Carpentier, however, wrote this book simply for the purpose of writing literature. It is ironic that Carpentier spends much of his book ridiculing the pseudo-inetellectual community for their pretentions to greatness, while in fact he is the worst of them all. References to works of literature and music seem out of place and cited only to prove the author's familiarity with them. If you want a better treatment of the same theme, read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness instead. The Lost Steps is not worth touching with a ten foot pole."
3,ok costume,The costume was ok. It does not seem to be a costume that would last very long but my daughter only needed it for one night. The size was accurate. it was a little exspensive but most things are now-a-days.
1,Disgusting!,"Propaganda for our children. Agenda 21 came from the United Nations and is all about control. Not to mention one of the authors used to send toys to children that were used to kill them and now wants to ""help"" them. Lets not forget that hyprocrite Al Gore who wants us to do as he says not as he does. This book is garbage."
3,Nostalgia,I remember this book fondly from my childhood. It has lovely illustrations and gets children thinking about environmental issues. On the other hand I imagine it's quite out of date by now.
4,Walker Texas Ranger,I have over the years caught up with Walker on each visit to the U.S. and have eagerly awaited each one with anticipation. I have yet to find one which disappointed
5,Quicker Release,"I enjoy watching Walker, Texas Ranger over and over. It really help me to focus on my job and the problems that I faces day to day at work. I wish the other seasons and be released all at one time."
1,Inanimatrix,"This is a series of 9 shorts each of which is,unfortunately, too long,too predictible and too boring. Necrotic. Plus, the interface stinks and you have the pleasure of seeing all nine sets of credits at the end of each individual short.This is one star because reviewers can't give zero stars!Don't buy this. Don't rent this. Don't ever bother yourself with this."
1,Rediculous,"I rented this thinking it would be awsome, it had like all these sites saying the animations was awsome. When i saw the first like minuit animation thing i thought, thats good. then the rest... ohhhh the rest... I literally shut off my VCR while watching like the 7th one. This was the most reduculous thing i have ever seen. No offense to those who like it. But i would STRONGLY not reccomend even wasting the 2 bucks to rent it at a video store."
2,disheartening...,"further proof that at the heart of the Matrix is... little more than that revealed in the first film. The sequel and this animation shift emphasis from the notion that ""reality is a dream"" and emphasizes a by-now hackneyed ""man versus machine"" formula. Is this the world of the Matrix, or a preview of Terminator 3? The background ""Second Renaissance"" is third-tier Asimov at best, and Last Flight of the Osiris is not more successful at accomplishing anything than Final Fantasy. As for the others -- come on... Are a series of ""Tone Poems"" already the only things they could cobble together with such a rich concept?All in all, I suspect the Animatrix is the shape of things to come for the Matrix... but fortunately, we'll only have to go back there one more time..."
2,"The Animation is good, but the story kills it.....","I saw the Final Flight of the Osiris in the theater and I thought it was great. It had a great story and the animation was awesome. When the DVD came out I ran and bought it. OOPS!!! I started watching it and I loved the animation, they had some of the top Anime artists. The problem was the story lines, some of them just seemed pointless and you were just left saying ummmm ok. This would be a good DVD to rent, but don't buy it!!"
2,An overall disapointment,"Let me start of by saying I really enjoyed the matrix. The matrix reloaded was okay, but nothing special. I was looking forward to the animatrix because I incorrectly thought it would be written with a similar quality and caliber as the first matrix. I was wrong. I won't rehash what many other reviewers have already stated, but for those who are still deciding whether or not to buy, DON'T. You will be disappointed. The quality of the animation presented is sub par only to its dialogue and plot. Many of the stories are pointless and obvious. I fear the kid's story will start a new trend of teenagers jumping from the roofs of buildings so they can wake up in the ""real"" world. I am honestly not sure [who] thought that story up. With the exception of the last flight of osiris this was a poorly thought out poorly executed production. I advise that you rent before buying."
4,animation at its best,"The animatrix is a good renderation of the The Matrix Trilogy.Out of the nine stories on this disc my best stories will be The Final Flight of Osiri, The Second Renaissance Part 1&2, A Detective's Story & Program. The first Matrix was very confusing but with the Animatrix I was able to understand the story of the Matrix Trilogy. I recommend this DVD for all customers."
3,BETTER THAN MATRIX RELOADED,"Loved ""The Matrix"" and more than a little disappointed by ""The Matrix Reloaded""? Then check out THE ANIMATRIX. This superb, eye-popping and mind-engaging anthology of nine short animated films fleshes out background info and parallel stories that make much clearer just how the human-created machine world was able to subjugate the human race.These visionary, stylized films were commissioned by Matrix writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski and feature seven of the best anime artist from Japan, America and Korea. My favorites: The photo-realistic (CGI) ""Final Flight of the Osiris I"" and the hand-drawn ""The Second Renaissance Parts I & II."" Not for little kids. Recommended."
3,Luke warm,"I would describe my opinion of ""The Animatrix"" as luke warm. This is a collection of short storys that show alot of the things that the 3 movies did not. The first short story had the best animation and was intended to be seen between ""The Matrix"" or ""The Matrix:Reloaded"". The rest of the movies, short storys, explain how things work in ""The Matrix"" world and some of the past as it involves ""The Matrix"" story line. All the storys were animated & directed by different people, so the end product differs from one story to the next. I would'nt put this film in the same catagory with the 3 ""Matrix"" films, but its worth seeing if you are a real ""Matrix"" fan."
2,Skip it.,"What is the Animatrix? Nine very short and uninspiring animated shorts. The good part? You'll realize this after 2, and turn it off. Last Flight of the Osiris is another Final Fantasy. If you liked that movie, you'll probably love this DVD. However, the vast majority of humanity did not. Some of stories don't even fit in with the world already created in the first two movies. Creativity? Yeah... but it's missused: perhaps even abused here. The 'Anime influence' is terrible... almost Samuri Jackish. The writers took all the anime cliches and threw them together to make their story. The Animatrix is a terrible mix of cliches of many genres.Don't believe anyone that tells you this is necessary to understand The Matrix: Reloaded. If you want to understand it, go see it again. As for the Animatrix, unless you know you prefer animation over soul, or you are the type of guy that gets off on animated-half-nudity, take the blue pill."
3,Excellent animation,"The animation is fantastic. Any animation fan should see this work, but also should pay attention to how, even with the best animation, good voice direction and dialog writing can make a piece weak.In ""Program"" , it is the most apparent. Some of the most beautifully drawn animation I've ever seen with flat uninteresting dialog in the writing and delivery.This reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy. Again, a piece of excellent ly done ground breaking animation, but the voice direction was weak and writing terrible.I hope this opens the doors for most animation and maybe, someday, we'll get our cake and get to eat it too."
5,A visual feast,"Lots of good things to say about this DVD, but the main thing is that some of the segments are just... hauntingly beautiful.This mainly goes for The Second Renaissance I and II. Which is sometimes extremely gruesome, but has an important story to tell. It also has some fantastic abract imagery that won't soon leave you.The same can't be said for ""Beyond"", which has much less story, and no action, but which is even more beautiful in all its understatedness. If you like good drawings, I beg you to notice this masterpiece. It is probably the single most beautifully drawn piece of animation I have ever seen. Not the least the *composition* of the frames is amazing.The concepts of the Matrix (what is reality? and are we prisoners?) are important to think about our situation in this world, and when they are represented as beautifully as here, they are a pleasure to consider also."
5,In love with Animatrix,"I am going to be brief and not explain every segment in this dvd. However, you must see this in order to understand why The Matrix and Matrix Reloaded was even started. You will be surprised as usual it is humanities need for control and our beutiful way of self-destruction.The animation was excellent! You learn a little about Trinity. And remember the boy who is always thanking Neo for saving his life in Matrix Reloaded- you find out why. You also find out why some programs are working for the humans while others are not. Some of the stories are little confusing so you may have to watch it again to get the gist of the movie.The dvd I have has The Visions, Translator, and Extras on it. Interesting if you like learning why they created the animation they way they did.If you are into the deepness behind The Matrix and not so much action then you will enjoy this dvd. If you seek action you will get some of that but you may be disappointed.It is all about CHOICE."
2,"Disturbing material, Overrated","Pros-Contains stories about why and how the Matrix was created-Some episodes have nice animation-Matrix, geeks, and some anime fans will enjoy itCons-Most episodes have stupid looking animation-Weird stories-Slight nudity, even if it's a robot, and a lot of skimpy clothing (really PG-13?)-Tried to be too symbolic and artisticOverall, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Just rent it if you really curious to see it."
1,me again,This disc is mess-uped. Any kid under 11 SHOULD NOT FOR ANY REASON SEE THIS. It messes with your mind
2,Start's great then fails,"This DVD start's off wonderfully with ""Final flight of the Orisis"", the animation is outstanding and it does a great job of setting you up for ""The Matrix Reloaded"". But after than there isn't anything really worth your time. Only two others come close and those are ""Kid's Story"" and ""Detective Story"" and those are really pretty far from relating to the movie. If your a anima fan you may enjoy these just for the animation, but for my after ""Final flight of the Orisis"" it lost any real Matrix feel to the stories."
5,AWSOME!!! really helps you UNDERSTANd the matrix...,"has 9 episodes, but the ones to really watch are ""The Reinssance parts 1 and 2"" to fully understand the matrix.good stuff in here, and no complaints from me."
2,A load of crap.,"I anticipated the Animatrix to be a good production. First I saw Final Flight of the Osiris which was the best anime short that I have ever seen. But then I saw The Second Renaissance I was disquested. The Second Renaissance was the worst short that I had ever seen in my WHOLE LIFE. After that, all the others were either boring, pointless or just plain lame. Do not buy this DVD..."
3,This ran on my DVD as ALL Japanese,"I was expecting to at least be able to run it with English subtitles. I'm a big fan of Japanese Anime, but was a bit annoyed that I had to watch this in *all* Japanese. I'd be very interested to hear other folks experiences...The animation is really well done, though I thought the imagery in the Renaissance pieces was a bit, well, sick. The level of violence was unnecessary IMHO as well as overly graphic in a very negative sense.On a visual level, it was quite well done. Some of the plotwork could have used a more effective writer and/or editor, but the visuals redeemed the segments."
3,Definet Rental,Rent this DVD. Don't buy it. Each one is unique and fairly interesting but the whole thing isn't worth owning. If you are fan and will get the trilogy boxed set when it comes out then if this isn't included then I would get it. Otherwise just wait for it. Second Renasiacnace Part 1 & 2 is great since it is a prequel to the films. Kid's story explains who that annoying kid that pops up in Matrix Reloaded.Anyway they are interesting but unless you've got money to blow just wait till a boxed set comes out.
2,Animatrix is a failure,"I thought ""The Animatrix"" would be better, since it's a Matrix movie! Only 3 out of the 9 mini-movies were good. Only the first on has real Computer Animation and some of the animation isn't even colored in. If you're gonna watch this, just watch the first 3 mini-movies and then just watch the real ""Matrix"" with Keanu Reeves. I would have expected better of Andy and Larry Wachowski."
3,Wait for the box set...,While the animation styles are varied and great if story drives your purchases I would wait until this is boxed with the Matrix set as I assume it will be.It is a classic example of form over substance as the animation is varied and excellent but the stories are universally weak.I was surprised in these shorts how many existing visual images were used. The dearth of original imagery is disturbing and makes me wonder and worry about what has been burned into our visual minds.A definite rental but I wouldn't purchase it if you are not into animation. It really does not further the Matrix world at all.
2,Unoriginal,"After reading the scores of positive reviews here, I decided to buy the DVD without renting it first. Boy was that a bad decision. Although some of the episodes were entertaining, most of them resorted to simply copying basic themes and visuals from the first movie. The dialogue tends to draw staight off the first movie which can get really annoying. Also, rather than coming up with new machines, these episodes show that in fact squidies are the only machine we will ever see. Except in the last episode which manages to destroy this one good point by being extremely confusing.I suppose if you really like anime then you might like this dvd more than I did. I'm a really big fan of the Matrix. I thought the first and second movie were fantastic. This DVD is definitely not anywhere near the level of those movies. But if you are a big fan, you'll probably want to see these once so rent it or borrow it from a friend."
1,Not worth the time or money,"If logic had anything to do with hollywood you might expect that if you liked the Matrix you will like the Animatrix. Wrong!!! Unlike the Matrix, the Animatrix is collection of short anime's (to short to hold your your attention, let alone remember them to recamend to a friend). The animation itself isn't bad, infact it's pretty good, the problem is, that the only thing they are showing is naked chicks and these fake looking robots that could come straight from an H. G. well's production! It's sad, really, because the Matrix appealed to so many people, unlike the Animatrix which will only appeal to adolescents wanting some cheap thrills."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this DVD hoping to get more insight on the Matrix. I believe the origional plan was to make a full animated prequel film to the Matrix. Instead, we get 9 short episodes I don't know what. In my opinion, the only thing good about it is the animation. The stories make very little sense and have little to do with the movie. If you are an anime fan you would like this. If you aren't, it is a waste of time.---------------------------------------------------------------Nov 7,2003I would like to take back what I said about The Animatrix. My hopes were high before I watched it and I was disappointed after seeing it. I should have watched Matrix Reloaded before I wrote the review, which I didn't. After watching Matrix Reloaded I think Animatrix supplements the movie well. I take back my rating of 2 stars and give this a 3.5. Mainly, because I'm not a big anime fan. I'm sure anime fans would disagree with my rating. Judge for yourself."
3,Worth seeing once,"I was really psyched up for this collection after downloading the ""The Second Rennaisance, Parts 1 and 2"" at the theanimatrix.com. Unfortunately, the collection was disappointing as a whole -- most of the best episodes were the ones already released for download off the web. I did enjoy ""Kid's Story"" and ""Detective Story"", but as for the rest, I found myself getting bored with the slow pace of the stories. There were definitely some good scenes, but the ""newer"" episodes generally seem to suffer from an over-emphasis on visual effects and not enough attention to the plot. Recommended only for those die-hard matrix fans who are obsessed with owning everything matrix-related. As for the rest of us -- save your money -- better yet, buy a book."
5,Neat Idea,I really liked the idea of the separate plot line that was created just for these shorts. I also think it important to see this to understand more about Matrix Reloaded (and also look at Enter the Matrix for more info on the Matrix world).
4,Short But Sweet,"Though not a fan of anime, I felt this DVD contained some amazing quality and well written shorts relating to the Matrix movies. I enjoyed all of them, though a few stood out from the rest. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Matrix, technology, or computer animation in general.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the shortness of the DVD. I felt it could've used more content to watch."
2,Just not worth it,"Pretty disappointing...of the nine stories, only one, the story of the ""rise of the machines"" (oh wait, isn't that another movie?) is even halfway interesting. Great idea, poor execution."
2,Not as good as it sounds / looks,"This DVD consists of short anime clips that are joined together.It scores well on artistic content and quality of anime.What it fails badly in is the storyline.Viewers are given a sneak peek into a little bit of this and that, without much of a storyline to join it all up.Seperately, there is also a short clip on a teenage boy committing suicide in the belief that it will get him out of the matrix. I find this disturbing. Whether this will inspire copycats can lead to an endless tirade. I certainly will not be letting any impressionable kid watch this.As with the 2nd installment of the matrix, this comes across as quite a disappointment."
5,Anime+Matrix=Animatrix,"I really like this set of films. The website really provided a good idea of what kind of things to respect. The first three films were written by the Wachowski Brothers and deal with the films directly like what happened to the Osiris and why that boy always follows Neo around. The rest of the films range from wonderful (Detective Story) to down right freaky (matriculated), but absolutely great. I would highly recommend this for any anime fan and fan of the Matrix. And, if you didn't like Reloaded, don't worry, this is much cooler!"
2,Animatrix is a failure,"I thought ""The Animatrix"" would be better, since it's a Matrix movie! Only 3 out of the 9 mini-movies were good. Only the first one has real Computer Animation and for some of the mini-movies some of the animation isn't even colored in. If you're gonna watch this, just watch the first 3 mini-movies and then just watch the real ""Matrix"" with Keanu Reeves. I would have expected better of Andy and Larry Wachowski. They shouldn't even had wasted their time making a ""Animatrix""."
5,An Amazing peice of anime,"I myself hate almost all anime i see, with 2 exeptions, cowboy beebop, and this. this is an incredible 90 minute thrillride. alot of it doesnt make sence but 5 bucks says it will in november. the second renissance parts I and II are so cool. its the world before the machines rose and how they took over. if you like the matrix buy this. if you thought it was okay. rent it."
2,Rent if you are curious - no need to buy,"I am a Matrix fanatic, but, after buying and watching this DVD, I was left feeling a little cheated. True, the films are visually beautiful, and they shed some (very little) insight into the Matrix (I II & III) story and characters, but I thought this DVD fell pretty flat as a whole package. The films are not very tied together (you can really tell there were different authors) and the stories are more like teasers.Save your money - rent this one if you are really curious!"
3,Somewhat dissapointing...,"Having enjoyed both Matrix movies, I was very excited to heard that they had made a DVD consisting of animated spin-offs. However, upon renting this, I found it to be somewhat dissapointing.Though it was very intersting to learn ""How it all began"" with the war between the humans and the robots, I thought that it was presented in an ""overly-violent"" manner. My companions and I felt rather ill while watching some of the shorts. They made both of the other movies seem like Sesame Street.However, dispite the over-done violence in a few of the films, the stories were all beautifully told and the animation was simply breath-taking. (My personal favorites being ""The last Flight of Osiris"" and ""Kid's Story"".)I advise Matrix fans to rent this movie, but before you do, make sure the kids are in bed."
3,retro,"Ok,Ok. Pretentious in my book. Check out the original Heavy Metal. Alot more interesting and fun and, who knows, possibly one of the inspirations for Animatrix."
2,"2 of the segments were great, the rest were not.",I was very disapointed with this film. I was looking forward to this DVD more then I was looking forward to Reloaded. But it did not live up to my expectations.
1,Not Quite The Matrix,"I am an avid Matrix fan. So I was excited to have my copy of AniMatrix arrive in my mailbox. I quickly opened it and watched through all 9 episodes. I watched the first one and thought this is real good stuff. Unfortunately, the only one worth watching was the first one. Each one that followed got stranger as I watched them. My teen-aged sons said it looked like the Matrix on drugs when it came to the other eight.Unless you are really into the amine art/cartoons, it would be best to only rent this video."
2,Disappointing,"Like Matrix Reloaded: lots of hype, lots of anticipation, and man... how disappointing."
2,Boring,"Rented this cheap at the local supermarket...to see what it was and glad I did. Basically nine short films done anime-style or with CGI (Final Flight of the Osiris, first one).I just found the whole thing boring. Found myself fast-forwarding to skip past the overdone imagery to see the nine stories unfold. Not really that much to ""watch,"" even for a short film. Some of the voice acting is awful and clichéd when it's there. Mostly there isn't any voice, just the visuals and music.Those who LOVE anime that skimps on voicework will love this. Everyone else looking for some cool action (and drama sub-text, as in the case of Matrix Reloaded or even M1) will probably find this a real snooze."
2,It had so much promise,"It had so much promise. Really, when I bought this book I was thinking along the lines of Linda Howard's Mr. Perfect, which was a much better book. But when I got to reading this book, I was disappointed. I hate being plopped into the middle of a series and not know it, with back stories and characters that talk about stories that I don't know. And She's Got the Look did that. In the end, I found I didn't care if the hero or heroine got together or not."
1,"Light, uncompelling sexual romance with dash of humor and mystery","After reading the synopsis for this book, I was thinking along the lines of Linda Howard'sMr. Perfect, but this was not the case. This was a very light, fluffy read where the heroine's never really in danger and what are supposedly side characters play almost as large a role as the 'main' characters. The 'mystery'/suspense was very easy to figure out and definitely not compelling, and the relationship between the main characters is very much based on sex, leading to some frequent and pretty graphic scenes. Although it starts out slightly humorous, it soon becomes dull and focused on the *mainly sexual and predictable* relationships between the characters.Bottom line: If you're looking for suspense, humor, mystery or a Linda Howard-type novel this will leave you unsatisfied; if you're simply looking for a light romance novel with lots of sex this is the book for you."
1,Like a 25 cent prize from a gumball machine,"I need to let people know a few things about this item that are not in the description.(1) It does not have ""big lenses."" The lenses are not quite 7/8"" in diameter.(2) The lenses are apparently plastic or acrylic.(3) Each lens has the same magnification (perhaps 5X).(4) Method for use. To get 10X magnification, you put two lenses together and look through both simultaneously. Since diopters are additive, you get twice the magnification. To get 15X, you look through all three lenses. But, putting these three lenses in series makes for a very cloudy image, even after carefully cleaning them.These points should have been stated. When I bought it, I thought each lens had a different magnification (5, 10, and 15). Glass would have been clear."
4,Desperate for affection,"Joan Jett has always seemed to me a little desperate for approval and acceptance, which is probably why she gives us the pulse-pounding ""I Love Rock-N-Roll"" but follows it up with a lot of safe filler. ""(I'm Gonna) Run Away"" is a memorable little chunk of bubblegum, ""Victim Of Circumstance"" has some amusing bad-girl lyrics, ""Little Drummer Boy"" turns the Christmas anthem on it's tail, but the record is basically low on originality and flavor. Jett would get her fire back 2 years later on ALBUM; this record treads the middle ground between punky rebelliousness and rock star wanna-be."
3,"Great album, bad transfer to digital","My vinyl copy was beat up so I picked up the CD reissue. Several great new additions, including the old classics, Louie, Louie and Summertime Blues. Unfortunately, the sound is less than ideal. A direct comparison (CD to vinyl) revealed the vinyl to possess far greater depth. I advise Joan Jett fans to wait for a good digitally remastered version of this CD. This one was released in 1998, but it isn't a good transfer."
5,They don't make'em this good anymore!,I have this on vinyl (original book style with very cool band photos) and it still blows everything else today way out of the water!!!! Can't even compare!!
1,the tape was broken,"I love joan jett would have loved to have heard the tape. it played one song and that jumped then it would not play at all. was not worth the effort to re send back satisfaction, no it was junk"
5,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts I Love Rock 'n' Roll,"I just picked up this CD today at Wal-Mart in Grand Forks and I loved it. I don't think I've had any other CD in my CD player all afternoon. the songs I liked are ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"", ""Little Drummer Boy"", ""Nag"", ""Louie Louie"", as well as others. I highly recommend this CD, especially if you're a fan of rock and roll music like me, even though one of my first loves for music was the Backstreet Boys (giggles). Anyway, I definetly recommend this!"
3,Memories,are not always reliable. I remembered this genre fondly and it does not seem to hold it's own over the years. Or maybe it's just me? The title song is still great though.
5,"""I love rock n roll"", a landmark album by Joan Jett.","This album is practically a landmark event, signaling the end of punk music as a source of toneless anger. It was replaced by the joyous anthem on this album, the very musical and melodically insinuating ""I love rock n roll"", now one of the biggest songs of all time in rock music history. When Joan Jett saw The Arrows perform ""I love rock n roll"" on televison in the UK in 1975, a light went off in her head that sparked a fire that influnced the sound of the 1980's in a big way.The echoes of this album resound in so much of the music that followed in it's wake. There is so much good music and energy on this album I had to give it full marks.To this day ""I love rock n roll"" is my favorite song."
3,NOT a review of Joan and the Blackhearts!,"Joan and the Blackhearts are awesome, issue here is the format of the ""CD"". Weird format that causes issues ripping to electronic format (for piracy? NO. Some of us like portable devices that don't spin).More than just audio on this item, would be fine if it was described as that in the first place."
2,Reasonable video but poor audio,Provides a good history of the Blue Angels but was made before Dolby Digital. There is no 5.1 or surround so don't expect to show off your system with this one.
2,Not so good.,"I'm sorry to say it, but when I first saw the comments here, I thought it was going to be a wonderful video. When I saw it myself, I found it awful. Most of the time they show only old Blue Angels' planes. I thought they were gonna show some demonstration or something like this. Frustrating."
5,You must have this book!,"In my opinion, this is probably the most important book writtenby W.D. Gann. I usually listen many comments from other Gannstudent who consider '45 years in Wall Street' as the best bookof this author, but this is better. I think that if you read many times 'New stock trend detector' you will find hidden some very important trading techniques that will help you to keep a good track record in your future operations. Naturally, the work for 'decode' this techniques among the examples made by Gann,is hard but if you 'love' the stock market and you need a real help in your trading, this is the book for you."
2,Written for citizens of the United Kingdom - NOT AMERICANS,"This book was written for citizens of the United Kingdom and other countries. Its value to American buyers, investors, and developers is VERY LIMITED. It deals primarily with visa, British Law, and expatriate issues. It contains two types of information: 1. general comments regarding real estate in the U.S.A. and 2. Florida tourist information (e.g. ...the best place to eat dinner in Tampa). All financial information is expressed in terms of the British Pound."
5,Well worth it,"This is a great book. I'm not a huge hockey fan but I felt awful about this tragedy. This book describes the family's amazing ability to forgive, despite such a tragic loss. I enjoyed the sneak peak into what goes on among teammates and seeing the more personal side of hockey. Very well written."
3,I hope I could be like the Snyders,"I was given this book by a friend without knowing anything about Dan Snyder or Danny Heatley. What an amazing story about two pretty impressive young men. After reading it, I wish I could have known Dan Snyder. I hope that if I were ever in this situation (heaven forbid), I would do what the Snyders did. In our litigious society, they are absolutely amazing people.The only negative about this book is that there are so many names dropped in along the way that I couldn't keep them all straight. The name dropping distracted me from the story itself.I wish the Snyders all the best."
4,Whorf's postulate,"The model (theory) of the world that an intelligence will formdepends upon the particular representation used by the learner.(Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw Hill, 1997, pgs 65-66)While this is rigorously true for the learner's INTERNALrepresentation (i.e. the language of thought) it will alsoapply to NATURAL languages that the agent employs to thedegree that reasoning is performed in the natural languageand/or to the degree to which the natural language mirrorsthe language of thought. This dependence of the learner'sunderstanding of the world on his language may help toexplain why translation between natural languages is sodifficult. Gentner and Goldin-Meadow's book does a goodjob of discussing current research in this area."
3,The Story of Sam Houston,"This is a story of how one man can make such a difference to American culture. It tells the story of how Sam Houston fought for Texas'independence from Mexico.He served as president of the Republic of TExas and as United States Senator and governor of the state.He won his greatest victory in the Battle of San Jacinto.After many battles with the American system he finally got what he wanted, the independence of Texas."
2,Breaks easily,"Our son LOVES Jay-Jay. So, we got him several of these wooden character figures. I liked the chunky size. Easy for a little guy to grab on to. We got Snuffy, Jay-Jay, Herky, and Tracy. Without exception, they all started breaking within a few days. One lost a piece of the tail, one lost an engine, Herky lost his propellor. I lost my mind listening to, ""WAAAAAAHHHHH! My Herky (Tracy, Snuffy, Jay-Jay) is BROKEN!!!"" I like the idea of this toy, but in practice, it's not a well-made product."
2,Not well made,We have a number of these characters. They are not as well made as the Thomas the Tank Engine wooden playthings. These have a lot of plastic parts that break off. So far Tracy is missing the plastic parts to the engine. Old Oscar lost his propeller as did Big Jake. My boys enjoy playing with them still but I wish they were better made.
5,THE COOLEST GAME EVER,This is the bes game I have ever played in my hole life I wanted this game for sony playstation but i can never find it any were christmas is almost here and if I dont get it for christmas iIwill order it here. I have alwas liked the game even though I beat the game 18 times I still find it a good chalenge. The thing I like about this game is you cant die or have to start over again. I think this game should be sold more it should be a bigger game so it isent so hard to find. I really want this game i have been looking for it for about 5 to 6 years. Thats what i think of this game.
4,A say 4 1/2 stars.,"This game is funny, medium-hard, and altogether great. Why the half star taken away? Well, despite it's greatness, once you beat it, you never play it again. I say, it's a great renter, but I do not recomend buying it."
1,Insecure mounting arrangements,"If I had not already ordered this product and had seen it in a store I would have never purchased it. The vertical tube is a loose fit in the top and bottom mounting attachments. There were some bolts that were provided to act as a modifiedcompression"" bolt and even with the bolts tight the pedeltal stand was very wobbly and not something I would put a 110lb grinder on top of without modifications to provide a sturdy and safe mounting platform."
5,Storming,"Mahler's trio of songs from ""Das Knaben Wunderhorn,"" ""Kindertotenlieder, and ""Ruckert-Lieder sung by Dietrich Henschel with the Halle Orchestra conducted by Kent Nagano on the Teldec label stormed into my imagination with its glorious sound; by turns martial, reflective and poignant. I have loved these Mahler classics since I first heard them and already have other singers in fine voice, but another fine version is always worth having. This one is exhilarating!"
1,Glorified romance novel,"I picked up this book with a lot of hope. After all, it is about my homeland, Andalucia. After a few pages, though, i just couldn't handle it. It reminded me too much of a romance novel. The tone is identical."
2,Not exciting,"The only remix that I like on here is track #5 (Jason Nevin's Mix). This remix is amazing...it's hard, has a great beat for a club and is vulgar and funny (he reworks all of her vulgarities into humorous combinations). HOWEVER, this track is obviously ripped from vinyl. There is a strong buzz in the background that is really obvious when the beat drops and there is hardly any sound except for this constant buzz in the background. Considering that this remix is really noisy and has a lot of loud sound effects it would have been nice to have a cleaner copy of it on the CD; I mean, that's why we buy CDs anyway."
5,Avengers at their best,"Forget the ultimates that try to be ultra hip and edgy, this is the solid avengers that works based on great writing.we have here a red cloud spreading across the country with no hope in sight, the avengers can only hope to get people out of the way but can do nothing for a little kid screaming for his parents who have died in the cloud, it's moments like that i love, it shows how even the powerful avengers can't solve evrything.as their own people fall, the avengers are spread thin, saving people on one front, trying to get at the source on another and attacked from within by the least expected people.you don't need to be an Avengers fan to enjoy this story, just a fan of great stories, this is an epic that never forgets the little bits that make a story."
5,theodore's introduction to foreign languages,"This story is another companion book to the PBS series, and is a gentle introduction to the idea of foreign languages. Like the other books in the series it is well written and nicely illustrated, and is one of the better Theodore stories. All the tugs are excited about the arrival of the Tall Ships to the Big Harbor, and it's Theodore's job to say hello to each arrival in their own language. We learn ""hello"" and ""thank you"" in Spanish, French, Italian, German and Dutch. Nicely done."
1,Very dangerous product,"This product may be good for your hair. I don't know, 'cuz I haven't used it enough to say. But what I noticed the very first time I used it was how slippery it made to floor of my shower. Very scarily slippery, as a matter of fact.This conditioner contains Shea Butter and a lot of natural oils, which accounts for the fact that it's very slick and makes anything it comes in contact w/ very slippery.USE WITH GREAT CARE."
3,Betrayed,"With friends like these, who needs enemies? JoJo, Twin and Fatboy have been friends since the sandbox, a fact that the author reminded readers of in every chapter. Put these lifelong friends together with a stick up kid, a cheating girlfriend, and all kinds of informants and what do you have - one annoying street story. However, I did like the mention of one of his characters from his debut novel ""Entangled."" I thought the story had potential, but it just was not fully developed. Better luck next time."
4,Well worth the read,"Urban fiction is not my usual genre so how did a 40+ white guy in the suburbs end up with this book? K. Elliott, the author, blogs about writing and posts some interesting questions and answers. I started following him for those insights a few months back and have enjoyed reading his posts. I didn't think I would enjoy his stories but I liked his techniques.This weekend, K. Elliott put his Kindle titles on sale and I figured I would take a look. I should have looked sooner.This story was gripping and the characters were fantastic. I literally couldn't put the book down and had to finish it in one late night. The other reviews give a good overview of the characters and situations and I don't want to repeat all of those. I simply want to add that if you enjoy good fiction, give this book a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,My thoughts,This book was great agent mark Pratt is a busy man and cannot believe he slept with the stripper. I really enjoyed this book must read !!!
4,Tommy Was So Naive!,"I enjoyed the book. I just wish that Tommy wasn't so naive. All of his friends were doing him dirty, he continued to get robbed by the same man and he lacked the business savvy necessary to ensure his wealth accumulated from illegal activities could be turned into a legitimate empire. I'm looking forward to reading the third book in the series. I cant wait to see what crazy J. Black has been up to and what Tommy is going to do with himself after he gets out of jail."
2,"New Comic, New Country, Same Story","Apart from the origin and the ""last boss"" this is pretty much the same story we all know. The details are slightly different but not enough to make things interesting. Another reviewer pointed out all the similarities and complained that the origin story was not the same and called that a deficiency. I call it one of the only good things about this comic. Why do I need to read the same old story again? Why couldn't the writers have tried something new instead of just cutting and pasting the same Spidey origin story onto Mumbai? Did we really need an Indian Doc Ock, MJ, Flash, Aunt May, etc?Anyway, about the most interesting thing about this comic is Spidey's Indian suit (kurta and pyjama) and some of the cultural stuff i.e. Peter (sorry Pavitir) getting ridiculed for being a poor village boy wearing dhoti.If you're interested in India it's interesting somewhat. If you're interested in Spiderman it's lame."
1,It's a rip off,"Don't bother with kit, just send in a little baggy of he popcorn with return address and such on it. Lab fee is actually $30.00. Test kit is just a gimic to get your hard earned cash. When I figured it out I just chucked it."
1,Pro-lab Radon test,"This company has proved itself to be unprofessional, lack's integrity, and does not do what it says it will do. So far they have taken my money and are requesting more cash to do what they have not done, give me results on my radon test. This has been going on for 3 months with no end in sight. They are non-responsive, have no idea what ""customer service is"" and appear to have a scam program to bilk people out of additional money, at least that has been my experience. I cant imagine why??? Amazon continues to enable them to stay in business. Don't use them."
1,Don't waste your money,"This ""kit"" is comprised of a zip lock bag, a pair of plastic loves, and a mailing label. You mail your sample and AN ADDITIONAL $30 to the company to have it tested. That wasn't clear by the description. It pays to read the reviews on Amazon!"
3,Asbestos Kit Review,Still waiting for results from the company. Was suppose to only take 7 days after they got it and it has been over 2 weeks. I am not happy with the company results so far.
1,Total cost?,"You would think you buy it, that is all the cost? Not true. The kit requires additional cost of $30-$45 for process."
5,Quick & easy,"Couldn't find any test in chain DIY stores. Test arrived quickly, was easy to take samples from multiple sources & results were emailed back quickly."
1,What happened to my test?,I bought this kit to test the wiring in an old house I own. The kit showed up promptly and was easy enough to figure out - capture a sample and mail it in to the testing lab. I am wondering if this lab even exists because I have never heard anything back from them. I think the 'test lab' is probably code for 'trash can'. I recommend mailing in the money but nothing else - you will save time and get the same results. So if I could give this zero stars I would.
3,Loophole,"The version that I watched had a different cover design, but since this one is priced $2.99 I'm assuming that it's the same or similar. An interesting movie. Basically Sheen is an architect that has kids in private school and a wife who expects a certain lifestyle, but has run into financial difficulty due to employment issues. After being ""hired"" by a man planning a ""perfect"" bank heist to provide technical advice on a neighbouring building, Sheen is informed about the plan and, with some reluctance, eventually becomes further involved. Perhaps not the most well-acted movie of its kind, I guess the biggest fault (with the edition I viewed, at least) really is the image quality."
4,good for teens,this camera was great for me and my friends when we went to mexico. it was durrable and stood out so we could find it easily. overall i would definately buy another!
5,Very good,"Samurai Showdown on SNES was better than the SEGA version. Why? Because unfortunately, the SEGA version was a little choppy and a lot of the sounds were taken out. Also, the fat ""ninja"" who wore pink, Earthquake, was also left out. \Granted yes the SNES version made no references at all to ""killing"" your opponent in the pre-match intros but who really paid attention to those? Thought not.Anyway, the gameplay is pretty basic on here. Hack and slash, occasionally use a special move and cut your opponent in 2. Like a lot of the fighting games of its time and now, it's replay value is somewhat low depending on how into the series you are.Even so, Samurai Showdown was a good game. Give it a shot. Maybe see if a friend has it or if you still can, rent it."
4,Interesting fighter.,"This is a very fun fighting game and has many different elements compared to other fighters of its time aka street fighter, mortal kombat, etc. I would recommend it to any fighting game fan or SNES collector."
2,Disappointed,"This book is dedicated to the production and racing history of the Triples, but not much of it is useful. It has a few pages of color pictures, but only covers a few model years, and even the bikes pictured are not original, and have been modified.There is only a few scant mentions of the Rocket III, and very, very little in terms of detailed info. If you are interested in the history of the racing triples this is for you. If you are looking for information for restoration purposes, keep looking. This isn't it."
3,Vienna,"I am glad I purchased this guidebook for our upcoming visit to Vienna and found the information on accommodations, restaurants and sites useful. (Since we haven't visited Vienna, I can't judge the reviews' accuracy.) However, the authors' effort to stick to the ""Top 10 format"" sacrifices cohesion and the book is hard to follow."
3,Children's Guitar Method,"This book is not my favorite for teaching little ones, or even big ones. The teacher parts are written directly under the student parts and can be confusing to the young student. Also the strumming patterns are overly simplified to go with the teacher section which is written with quarter, 8th and 16th notes."
3,THIS IS AN ANTIBIOTIC!!!!,"This can be a very useful product for some dogs with chronic diarrheal problems. But Hey, Guys -- this is a drug! This is a drug we use in our food animals. This is a drug to which we do not want to create resistance. So please. Don't use it without a prescription from your veterinarian -- both for your pets and our world's safety. And unless you have a show dog and a prescription from your vet, don't use it for harmless tear or saliva stains...It would be really nice if this antibiotic continued to be effective for it's intended uses (keeping our food chain safe, and helping animals with diagnosed antibiotic responsive diarrhea)."
5,Miracle Cure for Maltese tear stains,"My Maltese suddenly developed terrible red tear stains. His hair also started turning pink around his mouth and on his back paws. Our vet said the staining was being caused by the hairs' reaction to the dog's saliva. Our vet recommended Tylan Powder. We only use a ""heaping toothpick"" full in the dog's drinking water (1 per cup - once a day). At first, I found it hard to believe that such a tiny amount would work, but it did! It's amazing!! The staining stopped almost immediately! Our Maltese's hair is back to being pure white. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Tylan for dogs.,"If your dog has constant digestive problems I would highly suggest you forego all of the expensive vet medications and try this for your pooch. For my dog, and several others owned by friends, we had exhausted all remedies for recurring problems with digestive turmoil, loose and bloody stools, and frequent rumbling in the intestines. A 1/4 teaspoon a day wrapped in a piece of meat or cheese has resulted in a healthy and happy dog. You must try this."
1,Not for cats,This product was recommended by our vet with the caution that the cat might not like the smell.. Well the cats will not eat it mixed in their food.. It does mix well but the cat can't get past the smell.
5,Great product,I've used this for years with great success for curing occasional cocciddia outbreaks in dogs. It is also reat for eliminating eye discharge and tear staining in dogs. As always you should consult your vet before using any medication and discuss the proper dosage for your animal.
5,Standard Poodle IBS,"This should be called a ""wonder drug."" For years we took our standard poodle back and forth to the Vet's office for diarrhea issues. We were prescribed Flagyl over and over, had stool tests done but it kept reoccurring. After the first dose of Tylan powder (I bought the capsules and capsule maker too)no more diarrhea. I don't give it continuously but after reading other people's reviews and visiting a Greyhound blog I will give it to her every day of the rest of her life. It is safe and extremely effective."
4,Tylan & PepcidAC for Dogs,"My little MinPin has been on this exact med., Tylan 1/8 of a teaspoon per day for years to control his colitis. PepcidAC 1/4 tab 2x per day as well. He has done wonderfully on it. I highly recommend putting the Tylan powder inside gelatin capsules and coating the capsule with peanut butter, as the med alone tastes TERRIBLE. Also, speak to or see your vet before beginning this med to make certain it is okay for your dog to take."
5,Good Price; Good Product,This product works fine. We use it for our dog who has SIBO and pancreatic insufficiency to keep excess bad bacteria overgrowth in check in his intestinal tract. We capsulize it and then give a capsule with his food. You can't just mix the power in the food due to the extremely bitter taste. Price here is about 1/3 what the vet charges.
2,Not quite what you're hoping for,"My kids loved it, but the wood & paint chipped within 2 weeks as well as the tire just popped off and the all the metal screws rusted. (It hasn't been exposed to any salt water and just a little 'normal' kid water.)"
3,Poor Quality,"My [...] son loves Jay Jay and has a fun time playing with these characters on his airplane table. However, almost all of the wooden characters are broken in some way. Jay Jay broke the day we got him and since then his paint is chipped and one wing is detaching from his body. Similar things have happened to the rest of the Tarrytown Gang. I wish these toys were as sturdy as our Thomas Trains."
2,Another Made in China Toy,Nice toy - every kid LOVES Jay Jay!Too bad it's made in China... I'll have to worry about potential side effects.
2,fun but unsafe,"This review is regarding all of the wooden Jay Jay characters, which we have purchased in the last 2 months. I would discourage someone from buying these characters because the majority of ours have fallen apart or broken in some way that is unsafe for my 4 and 2 year old. Some of these parts include small wheels, screws that hold small wheels on, small propellers, back sections (such as on Savannah) that are held together by sharp screws, etc... The faces have yet to fall off, but they are loose and I expect them to soon. My boys love these planes, but I do not feel they are safe to play with. I am surprised that these wooden characters have not been recalled."
4,defintly an album worth listening to,with cuts like uncut pure and la la land Kane contiues to be a great lyricists. He also shows that he is versatile by the way he comes off id Do you really know and Hold it down. This album made me look forward to the next project by Kane because as you listen to the rhymes youll see that it only gets better with time. Defintely a great album and I hope to hear more from him in the future.
3,It is'nt bad!,I found this album at a used cd store and I bought it because my barber love Kane. This album is giving props and shout outs to everyone. It is alright if you were born before 1977 and remember how rap used to be. If your going to buy RUN-D-MC new album Crown Royal(if it ever drops) then this album is for you.
2,Like the older albums,"Ok release but not to my liking for finding the beat, the dance, the message of his earlier offerings...times had changed and he felt that he had to adapt."
2,defprince review on veteranz day,"I love the Big Daddy kane, but this album aint all that! Maybe because he sounds a bit different, maybe the beats aint as hard and funky as before.The illest rhyme is "" Do you really know "" conscious lyrics, the kind of stuff that made big daddy kane the boss of bosses.But hey, don't take my word for it, maybe my expectations are too high."
5,Megan in Ancient Greece,Megan Ryder is a 12-year-old girl who lives with her mother . Megan has a friend named Ellie. Ellie has an attic with an old steamer trunk and every trip she takes the trunk has more clothes. This time when Megan slipped on a tunic and looked in the mirror she traveled into Ancient Greece.That night in Greece someone steals a very precious thing from the temple.Will Megan be able to find what was stolen?Will she be able to find who steals it?You'll be able to find all these answers in this book full of adveture.Over-all I think this book was exciting and shoud be suitable for any age to read.
2,Nice Idea... Just don't wash them!!!,"I have 9 of these things! They are roomy and sturdy right up until you need to wash them. After that, they are small and start to fray. I was excited when I first received them, but now I am rather disappointed. It didn't matter if they were dried in the dryer or not. I washed some and hung them to dry and they still shrunk and wrinkled and started to tatter after a couple uses. Then I washed and dried some in the dryer and the result was the same! I would have to say now that I do not recommend this product."
2,Similar to the original,"I thought, no, I expected that this CD would be just the copy of original soundtrack. But it is not. The sound of this CD is revival. Although the sound is not the original, I admitted the play was so effective that it is very similar to the original sound."
4,Mini Battery Charger with Battery,"For the price, I was expecting this charger to last only a few months but so far it has held out. I haven't used the battery as I had expected but it appears to function as advertised. The real test will be known once I take it out on a shoot but for now I am giving it 4/5 score"
1,Stopped working,"I got about five chargers out of it and then it stopped working. I have the NP-F970 and the title description says it works with the NP-F970 but on the back of the charge says ""For use with battery sony NP-F550."" I don't know if it stopped working because it's not made to charge my battery or it's just plain junk."
1,not the correct charger for NP-F970,"Beware, this is not the correct charger for the NP-F970 battery as indicated in the title/description! Had to return it."
5,good and easy to use,"easy to use , and it also makes your gain time and dont have to carry a camera to charge your bateries"
5,I can charge batteries on the go or in the office,This charger is a product that has come in handy over this past football season in keeping batteries charged and ready at all times.
4,Good for the family,"Got this for Christmas. Used it on the cr ride to visit families. I wouldn't say it was tons of fun and didn't elicit laughter, butndid startngood conversations. I learned new things about my children's faith. Good for the whole family. Ournkids are 15, 12, and 7 and it was enjoyed by all."
1,Hard to tell if it is good or not,"I bought this to replace a lost charger. The description was misleading as to what plates it came with and it did not come with the plate I needed. I went on the company's website to attempt to order the plate I needed and was unsuccessful. I found the plate but everytime I attempted to order it, the website errored and couldn't complete my order. After 3 failed attempts I gave up. If it comes with the plate you need it may work for you but if not, GOOD LUCK."
1,all defective,I bought 5 of these from amazon and 3 from Fry's. Every single one was defective. Do not buy this product.
5,Environmental science,I had to buy this book for my AP Environmental Science class. The book was in good conditions when it came in and the CD was included as well. Good buy and great value.
1,Hate amazon magazine subscriptions,"Love the magazine. It is absolutely fascinating, but, most of the projects require the digital subscription, which amazon does not include, even though you are paying for it. You need to get the magazine directly from makezine.comIts nearly impossible to do the projects in this magazine without the access to the web."
1,Subscriptions through Amazon,"Love the magazine, hate subscriptions through Amazon. I subscribed through Amazon, but did not get digital access to back issues. It took several E-Mails and phone calls to get my subscription direct with the publisher."
1,"Mostly junk, of very limited interest--buy a copy first","I made the mistake of subscribing to Make, based on the hype. It turns out to be long and tedious, with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use. Successive issues have gone down hill, and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people's garage workshops. Maybe you'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk, but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe. It's not obviously wonderful."
2,ehh,"I bought this CD for ""Black Betty"". After listening to the whole CD, I discovered that was the only song I liked. All the other ones sound like European dance/pop club songs, and I thought they sucked. Oh, and most of the other songs are sung by some chick, not the guy on ""Black Betty""."
5,"Man alive, blown away.","This is my first introduction to Spiderbait, and I am completely sold! This is a great album. Although most people didn't like their cover version of Leadbelly's Black Betty, I loved it. It's as raw and as mean as Lead's own. I recommend this one to anyone who loves a good time!"
5,This Is One Great Rock And Roll Band,"Spiderbait have a rare gift, and I mean really rare. They can hit you with a chord change or a ""yeah!"" that makes anything else superfluous. Like bands such as the Ramones, Pixies, Nirvana, it isn't always the lyrics that make a song amazing, sometimes it's just the ""feel"". Sometimes they load up a riff and drive it home in a way that makes you just whoop and crank that volume. Imagine Helmet if they could swing. And had two singers. And a sense of humour. Can't say I'm a big fan of the ""Black Betty"" cover, but they showed how they felt about it's unexpected popularity in Australia by issuing ""F##cken Awesome"" as the follow up single! That's sure to get airplay. A couple of slower songs toward he end, but they are great songs and break things up nicely. Pretend they are the-next-big-thing and you heard them first."
5,"Member of Tom, Dick and Harry - Guitar, Vocal","This is Steve Burke, I was and am the guitar player for TD&H. Thanks to all for all the kind reviews! steve.stevieb@gmail. I am still in the Bay Area and continue to play for a few groups. Mostly, Hammond B-3 style Soul-Jazz. OGD, Steppin, The Nick Rossi Set, Fil Lorenz Soul-Tet and Jrod Indigo. As for the other members of the band, Jon, keyboard and vocals, still might be in the Bay Area. Ihor, the drummer, is still in the Bay Area. Craig, Bass player and vocals, I heard moved back to England. Maybe someday we will all perform again..."
4,Where are they now?,"Great, great band! I saw them live several times back in the mid 90's in the San Francisco Bay Area. As good as this CD is (and it's really quite tasty), it doesn't come close to capturing the sheer joy and exuberance of their live show. People would be jumping and dancing 'til their legs fell off. They used to do this amazing jazzed-up cover of ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now""! I wonder if they are still together?"
3,good if you stay with it,"This was a pretty good book looking at the role of religion in the colonial time period (a topic that has been understudied in our liberal/pc time). Most interesting was the connections made between religion (the great awakening) and the Revolution as an underlying motivator that pushed colonists to question authority after they had questioned their own lives/religions. It was a little slow in spots, but worthwhile if you keep reading."
5,Florida is more than Disney and early bird specials,What a wonderful book. Every state should be so lucky. Later day Florida is so Disney World and early bird specials that it is a joy to be reminded of the rich culture of its long hstory. The writing is so direct and clear. The book really grabs. I love it.
5,Seen at Sea,"I got to watch this movie in 1973, while stationed aboard the USS Oriskany (CVA-34) online, South China Sea. I loved it! It has great acting, and has - well - you need to see it for yourself! But if you don't see it here, you will need to find it in PAL format (European format), and good luck with THAT!"
4,Entertaining and Informative. A Great Reference.,"My girlfriend got this book for our cross country adventure from Indiana to Seattle. We started reading it to each other somewhere in Missouri and never put it down. The information is presented in a very concise manner and is also extremely entertaining. We found the book to be a great reference and used it to find day hikes in Oregon, mountain bike trails around Seattle, and campsites on the Olympic Peninsula"
2,Trite and Adolescent,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but was highly disappointed by the trite and adolescent writing. The story was good, but a freshman in high school could have written it more eloquently. In addition to an immature writing style and poor editing, the story had many distracting sidelines. I'm surprised so many others rated it 5 stars, because this wasn't worth my time to read."
4,One very cool replica piece!,"I didn't know quite what to expect from looking at the pic, but this is a mini flintlock with working flint hammer and trigger attached to a very safely blunt dagger. It has ornate metal scrolling and and good weight, and is a nice looking piece. Mine had some packing material stuck inside which initially prevented it from cocking but I managed to clean that out and it now works perfectly. This wasn't Prime eligible and as it turned out Seller wouldn't cover return shipping so if I hadn't been able to fix it I'd have paid S&H both ways, which is the only downside. Now I just have to come up with some sort of holster for it."
5,The best Contra game ever!!!,"Think you're good at Contra games? Think again! This game's easily the most intense 2D Contra game available. Why's that? Play the first level and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. While it's fast-paced action throughout, don't go thinking that you're gonna beat this game in one sitting. Huge explosions and enormous bosses really push the power of the Sega Genesis to its limit. And the 2-player mode is the greatest! Not that the 2-player mode's gonna help you get any further, but it's still really cool to play cooperatively with a friend. Four characters to choose from! Four unique weapons per character! Multiple endings! Just play it. You'll thank me later. Trust me."
4,"""Let's rock!""","If not for the insain level of difficulty found in this and others of its type, I would have given it five stars. The game takes place a few years after The Alien Wars (SNES) and you get your playing choice of a G.I.Joe-Duke-look-alike comando, a tough lady named Sheena (no, not Lady Sia!) who wears cyber-metalic lingerie and somewhat resembles Nova from StarCraft Ghost, a werewolf with a gatlin-gun for an arm, and a cycloptic robot named Brownie. Each characters starts out with a machine gun but gets his/her/its own set of additional weapons via power-ups.To sum this all up, it's a side-scroller that has you shooting everything up while trying not to get hit. You get 3 health points and 4 continues so be careful."
2,Wordy and confusing,"The author uses a lot of wordy language to make simple concepts complicated. Also I agree with another review: there is a lot of macroeconomics. I think Dr. Shapiro needs to understand how his readers learn, not how he can enjoy his writing."
3,"Can be confusing, major focus on economics",This textbook may not be a good choice for undergraduate students or for someone who does not have an intermediate or higher knowledge of finance. Wording in the chapters and in the end of chapter problems can be confusing. Statements are made and then not backed up with supporting information. The book spends a large amount of time on a macroeconomic view.
5,Gorgeous!,"This disc is filled with the flawless, pristine singing Chanticleer's admirers have come to expect. Upshaw's ravishing soprano adds to the beauty of this inspiring and festive collection. Highly recommended."
4,nice,"These are a cappella renditions of songs from a variety of sources; Chanticleer's style gives almost all of them a distinctly medieval feel. Beautiful arrangements, but don't expect to understand all the lyrics, even when you speak the featured language. The faked accents (as on ""Beautiful Star of Bethlehem,"" where I guess they were trying for Ozark mountain hillbilly and wound up with my home dialect) can be moderately annoying."
2,Good sound but poor selections,"Technicaly this is an excellent performance, however the choice of selections is doleful and does not bring much Christmas cheer to the listener. The earlier CD releases by Chanticlier were wonderful but this one misses the mark."
1,Not what I expected.,I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. I should have paid more attention to the fact that there was another artist performing with the group before I ordered it. I am sorry I bought it.
2,Sorely disappointed,All's I can say is that the entire CD sounded more like a barber shop quartet-type compilation!
4,Interesting selections; beautiful singing,"This CD is quite excellent, but I've knocked off one star for a simple reason: Dawn Upshaw. It's not that her voice isn't beautiful, but gee whiz, I wanted to hear Chanticleer! I felt that in the songs she sang, she completely dominated them, so my favorite songs on the CD are the ones which Chanticleer sings without her.I think my favorite on this CD was ""The Huron Carol."" I liked it because it is something different from the usual holiday fare (I'm getting awfully bored with most of what choirs usually sing for Christmas) and it expresses a completely different understanding of the miracle of Christ's birth. If you're looking for something new for a jaded Christmas music palate, this is certainly the CD to do it!"
2,Received broken,I bought these to use as decorative center pieces for a birthday party. The packaging looked nice but when going through the candies to put in my decor I noticed that over half of them (43 to be exact) were broken and unusable.
2,tasted fine,"THe candy tasted fine, but out of the box of 80 only 16 were not broken. So, i have a credit."
3,Arrived over half broken.,I had ordered these to be part of our candy bar in our blue and brown wedding. When they arrived over half of them were broken. I still gave three stars for the customer service. When I called to complain they were very helpful and refunded my money. We tried to use the unbroken ones in the middle of one of the jars but they fell apart so easy that we just ended up keeping them in back for the kids attending. The flavor was great but they are just to fragile for anything other then personal use.
3,Sansa c150,The product is difficult to maneuver among functions but performs adequately once you are there. Makes me wish I had purchased an I-pod!I bought inexpensive headphones so when I cut the grass the ear phones don't fall out. For what I paid it is 'ok.'
4,Great little mp3 player - color screen,"Easy to operate without reading manual 8/10Instruction Manual 8/10Radio Reception 10/10Radio Presets 10/10MP3 Music Quality 10/10Plug n Play 10/10Construction 8/10Overall a really good playerIt uses a AAA battery which is great, since sometimes I am hundreds of miles away from the nearest laptop or computer and I don't want to bring mine on certain field trips. I can just load up on AAA batteries and consume.Perfect for listening to books or learning languages."
4,My first mp3 player,I do really like this mp3 player. It fits a lot of music and you can add pictures too. Though the screen is quite small to display pictures well. I do recommend buying this player with a carrying case. It is a very small player and hard to hold because its so tiny. The head phones get twisted real easy.I am impressed with the amount of songs it holds.
4,Great for the price,This is not an ipod but it also only cost $40. It did not work at first since the battery enclosed was dead. After I put a new battery in it worked fine.
2,So much less than competitors. So so sound.,"I bought one of these from OfficeDepot (Sorry Amazon, but wanted it today). Price was way better here at Amazon, btw. Anyway, I have MP3 players from iRiver (the 5 gig hard drive model), Samsung (the venerable YP-MT6 they are no longer making but was fabulous), and my wife has Ipod mini.This device from SanDisk easily sounds the worst of any of these, and has the lowest quality build (at least by feeling of flimseyness. I only got it because it would work with Audible, but the device itself is so inferior to any or all of these other devices in sound quality, it's really rather striking. Otherwise, it does seem to do what it's supposed to do--just does not sound well with music doing it. Really, iRivers sound SO much better, it's not funny."
3,Good,"Good product for its price. Large capacity, built-in FM radio and voice recorder. Probably not the best,but for it price is a good buy. I dont like the control buttons, which are hard to push..."
2,advertised information is misleading,"""Sleek and ultra-thin"" in the description here is a huge stretch. This mp3 player is anything but ultra-thin. Yes, it's compact, but it is far from thin. They also advertise that it will show album art while songs are playing - what they don't tell you is that this feature only works with the pre-loaded songs that come already on the player, and that sandisk gives you absolutely no instructions in the included literature, or in the user's manual (which is not included - you have to go to their website to download it) on how to use album art. I tried for a couple of hours, on my own, and following the instructions of sandisk's tech support people, and the feature simply does not work."
3,DAUGHTER LOVED IT,I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER & SHE LOVES IT. SHE CAN DOWNLOAD BETTER THAN I CAN.
4,good product for the price,this was a gift for a teen.great sound on sansa's and priced well for 2gb and a good brand. the teen likes it.
4,SanDisk Sansa,"I purchased the SanDisk Sansa C150 2GB MP3 Player having absolutely no knowledge of how to use an MP3 player. Because I purchased a used copy, it did not come with directions. I am happy to say after about 5 minutes of playing around on the computer, I figured out how to rip my cd's to the computer and download the library to my MP3 Player. I love it! It's small and travels well. Its a great beginner MP3 Player for anyone to start with."
3,Average mp3 player,"This is a player that does everything well but not spectacular. Some wma 64kbps songs skip while others don't. Same songs play fine in other players. Thumbnails of photos load very easily thanks to the included software. Amazon claims the screen is TFT. Well, that's news to me. Nowhere does SanDisk make this claim on the packaging or on the install CD. Comparisons to STN and TFT screens on other players lead me to believe that the screen is STN. Or maybe DSTN. No way is it TFT. This player is new and already being discounted heavily. You may want to wait for the right deal or splurge for the higher end Sansa E series which is a much better investment."
2,Frozen after a week,"I ordered this player and it was great for about a week and then it froze when I turned it on. The company that sells it, TIGERDIRECT, has not responded to my emails so I went directly to SanDisk. SanDisk gave me a promt response and sent me a label to return the product with free shiping. Another bad thing about this player is that it organizes your music in it's own way and has trouble figuring out artists even if you have the artists name on the song."
1,Returned and then replaced,"San Disk C150. Stopped working in about 10 days(locks up after boot up screen), returned and received new one. Replacement stopped working in about 5 days. I am now going to replace it.And yes,I went through the SAn Disk support first,but they told me to return it. On a good note I was pretty impressed with the promptness of the phone surport."
4,"smaller than Amazon would have you believe; in fact, it's tiny","If you look at the ""Product Details"" section above it says ""Product Dimensions: 9 x 2 x 7 inches ; 1 pounds "". That's the size of an unabridged dictionary!! You'll be glad to know that 9x2x7 is the box it comes in. The player itself is 3.1""W x 1.4""H x 0.9""DHello, Amazon, are you listening? Why do you think it's more important to show the box size than the product size?"
2,Not exactly what I was looking for...,"I primarily purchased the product for recording lectures and it did not work well. The Mp3 recorder records the lecture, afterwards, recording is really bad. Sometimes it doesn't record at all or it erases the file or there is an error. In addition, the volume/sound quality is bad. Not loud enough. In the end, you need the software to transfer files, takes forever to figure out what to do. My brothers bought Mp3 player called Matchspeed (red color), good price and it worked great. Best player we ever had, 3 times louder then scan disk and the best thing, no software needed to transfer files. Just drag he items into the folder, thats all to it. And it records great. I hope this advice will help saving everybody's time."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this unit to replace a 1gig sansa I had, and am quite pleased with it. Regarding volume, there is a setting in the options to set to higher volume output. I use some SR60 Grado headphones and the unit drives them quite well. I only rip my MP3s at or above 256kps for the best sound quality, and use Windows Media Player to move my mp3s on and off the player. The file system used by the player is intuitive, and works well for me, (I tend put entire albums on, instead of individual songs) and the player groups them by artist or album. There is also a GOlist function. The audio is excellent, and really is a function the ear/headphones that are hooked to it. Lastly, it uses AAA batteries, I use rechargeables. Sounds just as good as any Ipod. And Amazon MP3s are DRM free. Excellent product"
1,Seller scammed me!,"Beware!! I purchased this camera in 6/09, for a gift for my nephew's July birthday. He opened the camera on his birthday and it did not work at all!! I contacted the seller and they stated that their return policy was for a max of 30 days--not listed on their site! I then contacted the manufacturer and found out they went out of business in Jan 2008--over a year prior to the purchase of the camera. The seller has still not honored the return or reimbursement, so I am stuck with a non-working piece of junk. Order at your own risk!"
1,The Merry Widow VHS,The quality of the VHS is not very good. The sound track is actually very bad. It must be a copy from some bad source.
3,Okay,"This game is a total rip off of Capcom's Street Fighter II, the only real difference is that there are only two playable characters in the story mode plus there is only one real ending as well. Art of Fighting may have some new ideas like using spirit gauges that limits your special moves plus the game also tries to focus on a main story instead on separate quests but these features could also be seen as negatives to some people. The graphics and scratchy sounds are certainly down graded from the Neo Geo cousin but the game still has some of the zooming effects which is rare for a SNES fighter."
2,Gets boring after a while.,"10 characters to choose from it also has a story mode, but it is pretty boring."

5,"Ah, to be young again.","The crystal purity of Judith Durham's voice floats out of my CD speakers and I am transported back to a time when folk, rock and pop became one. This is great music - period. It is professionally done but not souless, familiar but not stale. If you don't find yourself singing along with the Seekers' originals or covers, then go back to your hip-hop. For me, these two CDs are another excuse to look like a crazy old coot singing away in traffic with my windows rolled up."
5,The Seekers are sensational!,"The Seekers have a wonderful cohesive harmony as a premier folk/pop singing group. Lead female singer Judith Durham has to possess close to perfect pitch of any singer I've ever heard, and fronts for the group in a stable and sincere fashion."
3,disapointed with sound quality,"This compilation of the Seekers is pretty complete, but I am disapointed with the sound quality. Granted, I don't own any of the group's material on records or discs so it's hard for me to judge, but I expected better from EMI. Some of the songs are identified as being remasterded in the late nineties (based on their copyright dates), and those sound pretty good. However, the rest (including all of their big hits) sound very bad to me. Again, maybe their early material wasn't that well recorded, but I remember it sounding a lot better."
5,Rockin' Rollin' Ridin' With The Seekers,"For less than $20, this 2 disc CD set has an excellent assortment of songs by the Australian folk-pop group The Seekers. To this day, their 1960's songs are as fresh as today's batch of donuts! Judith Durham, Athol Guy, Keith Potger, Bruce Woodley and the rest entertained generations of people and I am sure future generations will embrace their work. I am dying to see the British film Georgy Girl(1966) as The Seekers performed the theme song for the movie. The Seekers cover of 'The Times They Are A Changing' sounds better than the Bob Dylan version! We are also treated to a Seekers cover of The Byrds' 'Turn Turn Turn'.'Love is Kind, Love is Wine' ...my favorite Seekers song...IS on this CD! This Seekers CD gets five stars from me!"
4,"Great, but a couple of criticisms","I am a huge fan of this group which became popular when I was a teen. In my opinion, Judith Durham has one of the best voices of all time. So, I was excited to get this compilation with the lure that it was digitally re-mastered, but not many of the songs actually are. Big disappointment! The other critique is why the producers couldn't find a way to include several excellent songs from the next to impossible to get album ""Future Road"". Songs from that album that are better than a bunch of the songs included on this cd are ""Future Road"", ""Speak to the Sky"", ""The Shores of Avalon"" and ""Amazing"". If the ""Future Road"" cd ever gets released again, it is a MUST BUY for any Seekers fan. Not including songs from it is the major deficiency of this collection."
4,"Very good, but not sure about ""ultimate.""","This is a very good CD which includes many wonderful songs recorded by the Seekers, one of the best singing groups ever. For the price, this is an awesome collection. However, the selection of songs for the CD is a little questionable. Missing are some of what I would consider to be their best songs, such as ""Keep a Dream in Your Pocket,"" ""Far Shore,"" ""I Am Australian,"" ""You're My Spirit,"" ""When the Stars Begin to Fall,"" ""Olive Tree,"" and ""Speak to the Sky."" Some of the songs on the CD seem to be from an earlier period, such as ""Whiskey in the Jar,"" ""South Australia,"" and ""The Wreck of the Old '97,"" which are OK but not really the classic Seekers sound which made them famous, with Judith singing the lead vocal. While this is a fine CD and certainly worth the price, I would stop short of calling it ""ultimate"" due to the omission of some of their best songs and the inclusion of other songs that aren't quite as good."
3,One More Kiss,Interesting topic.... what would you do or who would you be with if you had a limited amount of time left and you knew it?
5,movie & packaging,A keeper and have watched it three times. Will share with family & friends.Extremely well-packed and in perfect shape.
2,needs subtitles,This movie serious needs to be subtitled for americian and not scottish consumers the glasgowegain accents are really tough to understand
2,not what I expected...,"Wow - that was so depressing... I love Gerry Butler BUT, this wasn't for me!!"
1,Would have been nice to know...,Would have been nice to know BEFORE I purchased this product that the DVD I was sent will not play in American DVD players. I would have loved to see this movie...big Gerard Butler fan and he never disappoints...but cannot view the DVD I was sold by Amazon.com.
4,Good chick flick,"Very touching, moving film. I still cry at the end. The restaurant that Charlotte & Sam own is beautiful. The countryside & towns in which the film was shot is just marvelous. So makes one want to visit Scotland."
2,Dissapointing,I just watched this movie...and sad to say...was very dissapointed. I didn't even find it heart wrenching...as I heard it was. This wasn't the best role for Gerry Butler.His acting methods are MUCH more improved nowadays. I'm sorry....I just didn't feel sorry for this girl. I did like her father Frank in it. Also the ending seemed chopped...one moment she's lying in the hospital bed after her surgery talking to Sam...and then she was gone????? I thought the surgery was supposed to help extend her life? Being a huge fan of Mr. Butler...I won't be keeping this movie in my GB collection. I didn't think this was worth the money I paid for it.
1,One more kiss,"If I could, I give a ""CERO STARS"" I would do it, This movie is a joke, I can't belive the story of ""love"" of a selfish woman who is dying of cancer and the best she could do before she die is broke and destroy a marriage, destroy the life of the man she love, his wife and others in her path, and die peacefuly, and happy of what she did in the last days of her life, I was so upset and sick that, after I finish with the movie, the DVD went direct to the trash (not even in the recycle container) so bad I make the producer of this film some money and I can't have a refund, not even the good looking Gerard Butler (an actor who I really love) and the reazon why I bougth the movie can save it. please, don't waste your time and money, if you are a fan of Gerard, better buy a poster picture of him with your money."
1,ONE MORE KISS,THIS WAS THE MOST STUPID MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A LONG TIME...WHAT A WASTE OF GERARD BUTLER'S TALENT....HE IS AWESOME BUT THE OLD GIRLFRIEND IS UGLY & NOT NICE AT ALL. HIS WIFE WAS LOVELY....WHAT A DUMB STORY...
3,Sweet story,Living life's last pleasures before the end. Lessons learned - make the best of each day
5,Beautiful 'Little' film,"This was not a big budget film but they did a great job with what they had. The plot line is thought provoking and even if you don't like the characters, you do feel for them.There are a lot of visually arresting elements in this film. The coloring of the indoor shots evokes the proper mood. The outdoor shots are breathtaking! The use of music to advance the story was well done. I particularly like the use of 'Ave Maria' during the sky diving scene. I'd be praying too if I had just jumped out of a plane! The acting was well done all around even when a few of the lines were rather corny. Their accents are to die for! That alone would make it a must have for Anglophiles like myself. I could (and did) listen to it all day. As much as I liked this move, just seeing Sam's lip quiver when he cried made this movie worth every penny I paid for it!"
4,Mastering Observation - is difficult to Observe,"I have to say I found it difficult to pay attantion to. It would have been better in audio form. Dr. Joe Dispenza had very interesting perspectives but the camera man did not. It's a continuous/edited shot of Dr. Joe Dispenza sitting in a chair against a not too pleasing background, pretending not to be nervous, swallowing and gulping and burping under his breath as if he just ate lunch - FOR OVER AN HOUR. I didn't fall asleep only because watching him MADE ME ANXIOUS. Again - I loved what he said but I had to watch it again while lying in bed with my eyes closed! Please Dr. D, for your next lecture, GO WITH AUDIO or give us a LITTLE more eye candy - e.g. ""What The Bleep""."
1,The Worst DVD Ever Produced In The History of Ever,"I thought Dispenza's interview in What The Bleep was phenomenal, and so when I saw that he had a DVD I ordered it immediately. I am still slack-jawed. He talks and talks and says NOTHING. No examples, no how-to's - it is utterly without weight - just empty chatter [...]. It is also one static shot of him, sitting and yapping with an unsteady camera and sound that drops in and out at times. [...]"
1,"Just a ""What the Bleep"" Outtake!","Whoa! Don't waste your money, folks! I'm a huge What the Bleep fan, and I enjoyed Dr. Dispenza the most out of all interviewees. But this is truly a very disappointing one hour ""ADD-adventure"" further explanation of the point he made in the Bleep film. Not at all worth the money. If ANYTHING, buy it used. I guarantee many folks will be giving theirs up, looking to get some of that price back."
2,I want my money back,"Do not wate your moneybuy ""what the blib? down the rabbit hole""it has all the info you will need""Mastering the Art of Observation"" is a complit waste of timenow... how do I get my money back?"
1,Too small!,"My son loves Jay Jay but this toy has done nothing but frustrate him. Of course on the show Herky, Jay Jay, Tracy, and Snuffy all fit in the hangar (they sleep there). This toy, however, is so small that only one wooden plane or two plastic planes can fit into it which is very upsetting to him. He can't understand why they fit in the hangar on the show but not in ""real life."" DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! It would be much better to make your own hangar out of an old shoebox. The only good thing I can say about this is that it is a very well made wooden piece. Too bad it is WAY too small."
3,Totally overpriced!,"I bought this toy at full price after getting my son two of the wooden Jay Jay characters. I was sick of all the junky toys on the market and wanted to get something that would last a while and could be handed down. The editor and parent reviews raved about the wonders of the Jay Jay line, so I decided this was worth the ""investment"". This toy is made of real wood, and nicely painted so I suppose that is a plus. But two months after buying it my son has played with this toy about 4 times. The problem is that this hangar does nothing. It's just a painted piece of wood that you can wheel one of the characters into. If your child is the kind that can spend time in ""imaginative"" play, or a die hard Jay Jay enthusiast it may be worth it. Otherwise save your money."
5,great toy,This is a strong toy.A little small but my daughter loves it.This was a nice christmas gift.It got here just in time.
5,joan jett's only great LP,"honestly folks this release was and still the greatest thing joan jett ever came out with. this LP has really fast songs, sexual songs, and some other emotional songs. a great deal of variety went into this classic. all other releases besides ""Bad Reputation"" are boring, lacking!"
5,ATLAS SHRUGGED,"Read this as a young college student. It was recommended to my wife, and is as true now as when Ayn Rand penned it. Want to know what is wrong with the American Dream, today??? Read this!!!At one time, our parents thought they would do ""better"" than their parents and in a ""better world"". I was raised to ACHIEVE the same goals.Today's youth, according to observations, expect to ""RECEIVE MORE AND DO LESS"".Should Atlas Shrug today, they will ""achieve"" their expectations....................."
4,"Atlas Shrugged, I Shrugged","It is a very wordy publication that could have expressed its viewpoint in half the words. Sometimes the characters go for overkill to make their point, which in my opinion, is unnecessary. The theme is good, though, and makes you think about what is going on in government today."
3,A Tale Of 2 Books,"This is a GREAT 700 page book, the only problem is that it's 1150 pages. The first 600 pages are great. Well written and intriguing. However, after about the 700th page it starts to get a bit heavy. I found myself glancing through page after page without really missing anything of great importance. Things that could be summed up in a paragraph or 2 tend to go on for several pages. The worst part is that it feels like the same things are being said over and over and over. The author didn't seem to trust that the reader would be able to ""get"" her message the first time. A shame really. If this book had been edited properly it would probably be my favorite book, or at least in the top 5. To sum up: this is a good book for the most part just a bit heavy (especially towards the end.)"
2,"Good idea, bad delivery.","Pro: pro-capitalismCON: way too long and verbose -- it almost seems as if Rand tried to squeeze in as many words as possibleNo matter how true or right or great an idea or message is, if one fails to convey it in a succint and memorable manner, it's worthless. In retrospect I would just read the cliff notes for this treatise. Also, just like for the KJV Bible they have made Living and NIV versions in modern day language, the publisher of Atlas Shrugged needs to revamp it into a 21st century version -- they can use Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Meg Whitman for the protoganists. (Ok fine someone with more aesthetic appeal than Meg Whitman.)"
1,Rand denegrates the people who produced her book!,"Hear, hear to the reader from Austin Texas who got it exactly right. If I might add to what he wrote, I'll point out that Ms. Rand's book wouldn't have even been published without the efforts of many of the non-genius ""parasites"" she denigrates.Or did she--all by herself--chop down the trees, process the pulp (after building the paper mill), collect the material necessary for the ink and process it, design the printing press and build it (with the machine shop she built herself), create the bindery, proofread and edit her text, carry her books to every store and sell them herself? (And I've left out quite a few steps!)Of course not. In truth, Ms. Rand knew very little about the human condition, now or ever. What she knew about was her own ego which she magnified into thousands of pages of philosophical nonsense. For authors who struggle with the human condition, try Dostoevsky, Conrad, Hardy, De Assis, Toer....well you get the idea."
1,Monumental Waste of Time,"Worst book I've read in a long time. The premise of the story was interesting. The execution of the plot, to say nothing of the development of the charcters was overly simplistic and self-serving. Ms. Rand had a point to make, and attempted to disguise a 50 page treatise with over a thousand (!) pages of poorly written, repetitive drivel. She only manages to make her theory of ""objectivism"" seem all the more absurd. I don't normally write reviews, but this was bad enough to make an exception. If this saves even one person the pain of slogging through this torture, it'll be worth it."
2,brilliant work - terrible philosophy,"I am not going to bore you with details of the book. Many others have done so already. It is obvious, even to this so-called liberal, that Ayn Rand was a genius. Atlas Shrugged is a literary masterpiece. Just be sure to notice when you are being manipulated. I would fear a world in which the ""looters"" gained control. I would also fear a world controlled by Francisco, Dagny and Henry Rearden. A world the permits megalomania is not the one I wish to see."
1,"whiny, wimpy babies!","rand's first book, the fountainhead, converted me in an instant - it finally gave real world examples of believing in a purpose in life. therefore, i waited for the right opportunity (long trip overseas) to read atlas shrugged. after getting halfway through it, i am reluctantly putting it down because i can't stand the negativity anymore. a person can subscribe to rand's philosophy of Objectivism without having hatred or scorn for everyone and everything around you, but you wouldn't know it if you read this novel. the characters waste too much energy complaining and dropping out of the ""unfair"" society. what a bunch of whiny, wimpy babies! it's life - it's not gonna be fair! i have much more admiration for people that overcome without having to put down others to do it. now i have to wonder, was fountainhead the same and i'm different...or was fountainhead different?"
4,This book has had an enormous impact on the world we live in,"Atlas Shrugged is by no means a perfect book, but it must be read. Among its greatest errors are the one dimensionality of the characters. They are either good, or bad. There are no shades of gray. It is also filled with redundancy. There is no better example than John Gault's speech. The love story is clumsily handled. The writing is often mundane.The ideas, however, are so important that they would overcome five times that many weaknesses. The book is an unbelievably vivid illustration of the principals that make capitalism the premier system of government that man has ever devised. The threats to that system are illustrated brilliantly by showing how the results of well intentioned actions backfire."
1,"Where's a scissors, or a hatchet, when you need one?","A few friends agreed to finally take the plunge and tackle ""Atlas Shrugged""--which I've put off since having it thrust on me in college 30 years ago. I tried, I really tried, and I'm proud to say that I made it to about page 800. But, my God, didn't this woman's publisher employ an editor? Let's put aside the shrill rants and endless--and I do mean endless--philosophizing. Let's forgot the ""characters"", which are nothing more than silly embodiments of her ideas. Let's try to ignore the Captains of Industry business and the ""world grinding to a halt"" nonsense. But, how can you ignore the sheer length: unedited rambling; recycled tomes, regurgitated descriptions; numbing detail; and the florid prose? I admire the woman's chutpah, but it's a pity she couldn't write. This book is horrific!"
2,This doesn't work.,"I have been trying for quite some time to put my finger on exactly what bothers me about this book and I think I have figured it out. While I appreciate the author's enthusiasm for individual ability as well as his desire for said ability to be unfettered by the mediocrity of society, I do not appreciate the fact that he either naively or obstinately make no allowances for the fact that the playing field is not at all level. It would be nice to think that everyone has the same chance, ability, etc and that those who hone and use their ability deserve to reap any and all benefits with no obligations to the rest of society,because anyone could succeed as long as they work hard and think hard. However in order for this to work, the rest of society would need all the same advantages all of the time. So this doesn't work. So what are you to do?"
3,Atlas Shrugged Mass Market Paperback 50th Anniv. Ed,"The content is well known and I cannot add much to the discussion, other than to say it is thought-provoking and very applicable to our time. Amazing for a book more than 50 years old.The quality control on my copy of this particular edition was poor. Approximately 50 pages toward the beginning of the book were out of register, with the text skewed on the page, to the extent that the ends/beginnings of the lines on whole pages were truncated by as many as 5 characters. Those same pages were also not properly bound and came loose as soon as the book was opened. That said, once I got past that part of the book it was fine and I've enjoyed reading it. I probably would have bought a Kindle if this book were available in that format."
2,Very wordy and slow to develop,"Maybe it just me, but this has been a difficult story to get into...I know I really should finish reading it, but it really lacks something to maintain interest. Maybe I just have a short attention span or something. There are certainly parallels to current events."
4,Awesome! But...,"Awesome book. There isn't much I can say other than what's already been covered, but unneccesary cussing gets old after a while. 4-Stars"
1,Print is TOO SMALL,"I do not need reading glasses but this book almost requires a magnifying glass. I stopped at page 46 because I was concerned it was going to damage my vision. This book has 1,069 pages, so that is an alarming amount of strain on the eyes.I would recommend you check the different versions at a brick and mortar book store before you order a copy from anyone."
2,Buy the other one,I have been borrowing the 2008 version of this very long audio book from the Newport Beach Library for my vacation drives...I'm up to disk 33. It is narrated by Scott Brick and captivating. On the waiting list to re-borrow in Newport I got this 2007 version narrated by Christopher Hurd from the Irvine library. His voice is grating and uninspiring. I desperately hope I come to the top of the waitlist for Newport before I depart for vacation.
4,Epic read but worth it,"I'm torn with this one. I was disappointed that Eddie didn't get to go to the gully. I was disappointed that Dangy ended up with John, Hank would have made sense, Frisco even more but I didn't get the John thing. I agree with the basic meaning of the book although it enforced it too much. At times I couldn't stop reading, at others it was a struggle to keep going. Sometimes I think all I held onto was the love stories.....I can't be that shallow...can I? Overall I'm glad I read it"
4,a great book,A great book. Don't be put off by its length - it is very interesting throughout and worth the time.
2,"Rand was right, but she couldn't write.","This is not a book to read for pleasure. It is far too long and windy, the characters and pseudoscience are unrealistic, and everything is almost comically black 'n' white.There are some good ideas within, but it's probably not worth your time to wade in and find them. Read Rand's earlier fiction for somewhat better stories, or her nonfiction if you really want to get into her head."
2,Poorly written..,"I was always curious to read Ayn Rand because I know she has had a powerful influence on many successful people. Now I can't comment on her philosophy because in all fairness I didn't read the entire novel. In fact I gave up on about page 200. I got a sense of what her philosphy is, and I was somewhat drawn to it. Her writing, however, I found to be atrocious. Where the heck was her editor? And here's a handy rule of thumb: anytime you come across characters named Dagny, Francisco and Orren, run, don't walk to the exit."
1,As unrealistic and dangerous as Marx,"I found this review of Marx:""How can anyone actually disagree with what Marx said? Everything he said turned out to be correct. If you disagree with his ideas then you simply are not intelligent enough to understand what he said. Communism is TRUE democracy,not what the US is running. Those who disagree with communism are cleary not open minded.""Now substitute Rand for Marx and note that you have an ""Objectivist"" argument. In fact her ""philosophy"" is as worthless, unrealistic and dangerous as Communism."
1,"great book, ridiculous kindle price","I have an old paperback copy of this book and have read it several times. The print is tiny and faded and I would have liked to get a copy for my kindle and retire my paperback copy ... but not at this ridiculous price! I'm all for capitalism, and the market should set the price. Hopefully, the market for the kindle version of this book will demonstrate that the price is too high and at some point it will be reduced to a more reasonable, affordable price."
2,"Why did Ms. Rand ""Shrug"" Off the Editors?","I read Atlas Shrugged after THOROUGHLY enjoying The Fountainhead. I find Ayn Rand's philosophies engaging; however, I was disappointed in this book for several reasons:1. This book clearly needs editing -- themes were repetitious and the book is unnecessarily lengthy2. Characters were one-dimensional -- either good or evil3. Scenarios were somewhat unrealistic -- almost too fantastic to believeIn short, there are some insightful lessons to be learned from Atlas Shrugged. My recommendation is to skip this book and go straight to The Fountainhead."
1,Atlas Puked,"Gag. This has got to be one of the worst books ever written. Never have I read something that made me hate life and everything to do with it.The whole plot is completely unrealistic and horribly laughable. If all the ""movers and shakers"" went on strike, I highly doubt the whole world would self-destruct-no, you'd have people pulling together, taking charge and working together to get things back on track. In real life, Dagny Taggert would be a walking cocktail of STDs and John Galt would be the the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons.As one of my friends said, ""Reading Ayn Rand is like hitting onself over the head with a brick: it feels better when you stop.""Better yet-try and track down ""The Crucifixion of Liberty"" by Alexander Kerensky. Why that is out of print and this steaming pile is still being published, I'll never know."
5,Intriguing portraying of the ideal man and his role,"Objectivism is a new philosophy popularized by Rand, and this is the book that puts the philosophy to life. The book is filled with delightful subtleties and intriguing plotlines and characters. This is Rand's crowning achievement by far."
3,Why so long,"I think the book is good and makes an interesting point. I don't think people should go out and try to live by Ayn Rand's teachings but I make the assumption that, as fiction, that was not the point. My criticism is just that her story could have been told with half the words (see 1984). After a while, I found myself saying, ""you said that"" or ""I don't care anymore""."
4,"Worth reading, once.","This is not my favorite of Ayn Rand's novels - that would be Anthem. But it is still well worth reading. No, I am NOT an objectivist. I am, however, a huge fan of dark future novels. They tend to give great insight into character's minds. If you want to read Atlas Shrugged, but haven't read alot in this genre before, try first reading Anthem or Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 (both great novels) or We (a Russian novel by Yevgeny Zamyatin), or 1984. If you enjoy any or all of these, try Atlas Shrugged. You do not have to agree with Ayn Rand's views to appreciate and enjoy her novels."
