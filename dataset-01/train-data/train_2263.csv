3,Forerunner 305 is for serious training/serious techies,"This thing is loaded with options for tracking data from your workouts: distance, time, heart rate, % of max. h.r., pace, avg. speed, max. speed, gradient, cadence, etc., and the way that the data can be displayed is highly customizable, as are the workouts you can set up etc. For all that I regret the purchase.I was looking for a way to track my workouts/progress conveniently, since I'm not the best at recording them with pencil and paper. I'm frustrated by trying to work out all of the details of the display etc. however, even by the fact that I have to stand still and wait for the unit to get a fix on the satellites when I may be in a hurry to bust out a quick 30 minute run in the limited time I have to get in a workout that day. All in all, I find the unit to be more of a distraction for me than an aid."
1,BEWARE!!!!,I've had this product for 1 year. I was happy with it for about 7 months until some issues began to pop up. Most were minor and I simply reset it by turning it off and then back on which seemed to cure it. About a month ago all buttons stopped functioning and it started beeping and turning itself on and off on it's own. I have one friend who had similar issues and sent it in to Garmin. After a hefty repair charge he had the same thing happen to his wife's 305. After speaking with him and doing some research I found that this product has known issues and Garmin continues to sell them with no modifications to the units to correct this problem. I'm VERY hesitant to purchase another Garmin product and am waiting for my wife's 305 to fail as well. This product is a $300 paper weight.
1,Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor,"I purchased this refurbished product at Christmas time for myself, and my husband had the same idea of getting a watch for me. I have heard it is a great watch, but this one was refurbished. He ordered me a pink garmin which I loved more, so I decided to keep both of them and give this one to my mom for her birthday. She started using it, and it isn't working too well. The heart rate monitor doesn't work along with some other things on the watch. I should have tried it out instead of putting it away in my closet. Now it is too late to send back. Make sure everything works with this company, Warehouse Deals, Inc., before it is too late to send back."
2,Good while it lasted,"Well, its been 6 months since I purchased the product and the gps function has croaked. Everything else works but the distance always reads zero and does not change.I have tried to reset the watch (holding the mode/reset+power buttons) but that has not helped. The watch wasn't exactly cheap and what's worse is that I never dropped it and always wore a wristband under the watch so that it would not get all sweaty so I took very good care of it.I am very disappointed in the product's lifespan and Amazon only has a 30 day return policy so it looks like I'm outta luck!"
4,Garmin Forerunner is great,"I have had great luck with most Garmin products. I dont see the need to spend twice as much money to buy the next model up, when I only wear it for running. it syncronizes autmatically with your computer and updates all your records accordingly. the map is a cool feature too. Its fun to look back on the stats and progress.Worth the money if you are a runner. I bought this watch a couple of months ago, it is fantastic. I live out West and the GPS works great, measures distance accurately heart beats, calories average speed and max. speed. watch is comfortable enough most of the time."
5,Garmin GPS runner's log and watch,"I bought these Garmins as birthday presents for my two daughters...... they are both overjoyed with the results and the increased motivation it gives to their outdoor activity, long distance runs and biking..... wish I had had this gadget when I could do some daily serious running, back in the seventies and eighties..."
2,NOT worth the money!!,"I have had this Forerunner 305 for about a month now. I bought it to replace the Forerunner 101 because my 101 would take forever to acquire a GPS signal and I was hoping the 305 would be much improved! I was sadly mistaken. It takes as long as 10 minutes sometimes for it to acquire a signal, and if you are a runner in the park, like I am, good luck keeping the signal if there are any trees nearby. The only reason I gave this product a 2 star and not a 1 star is because when it does actually work, it appears to work really well. Unfortunately for me, that is not very often!"
2,Underperforms,"I bought this to use when running home from the train station after my commute. Very disappointed. It took 3-6 minutes after getting off the train each evening to figure out where it was. Not much fun standing on the station waiting for a lazy GPS. Each time I had to take it off my wrist to get any signal, and it always asked me if I had moved 100s of miles since last using it, or whether I was indoors.Once it finally got a signal I would run or walk home. Each time my speed per the GPS would oscillate between 6 and 12 mins/mile every few secs. Holding it in different ways made no difference. My route home is through suburbia with some tree cover but no tall buildings.In the end I gave up on it and got a refund from Amazon."
2,Gets your heartbeat up alright,"The watch is alright once it works - but today I waited 20 minutes before it was able to lock on to the satellites, and waiting for this thing time and again makes my heartbeat rise faster than in a full sprint.It's also a big, ugly chunky thing - not that I really care too much about that.Once it does finally work it's ok - measures various data such as distance, heartbeat and approximates calories burned. The attempt at measuring ascent/descent is ridiculous and all over the place. The Garmin Training Center software is a throwback to what made Windows 3.1 so exciting. The motionbased website is a tad better, and lets you compare your times with other runners, and is a bit more professional than Nike+ is for instance, but is still awkward to use.All in all it's a nice idea - sorry about the execution. Try again."
4,350 forerunner,I like the forerunner because of the price and the functions. My only complaint is that it is sometimes cumbersome when I wear it on my wrist.
2,Garmin 305,"The watch has 2 little holes under that allows the swet to go inside it. So if you use 3 to 5 time a week end swet when running, your watch will last no more than 1,5 year."
2,Good for running and no much more,This model has been on the market for a while. A little bulky and limited to 4 types of info at a time. Features rich for training. Buttons are hard to press. Not for daily use when you are not running.
3,Garman Forerunner 305,Good concept but too big and the heartrate monitor is on a tght band that fits around the chest. The band is impracticle to impossible to wear during vigorous excercise. Purchased as a gift for my dear (but hirsuit) nephew. Perhaps his body hair interfered a little with the heart rate pick up but that feature was useless for him. Would consider again if it was 30 % smaller and had a much more effective and less obtrusive heart rate monitoring system. The combination of size and poor heart ratee monitoring lead to lack of use so can't comment on the GPS features.
3,Heart Rate Monitor nearly worthless,"I was 56 years old when I began a running program. For safety, I wanted to monitor my heart rate, so I bought the 305. The HR readout is too small and CANNOT be read while running. It can not be moved to the larger pace/time digits. I set the warning beaper to 170. The beaper CANNOT be heard over ambient noises by an over 50 person. The frequency is too high and the volumn too low. The only thing this heart rate monitor is good for is a Post Mortem."
2,Horrible Customer E-Mail Support,"I gave a 2-star rating only because of Garmin's customer support! The wrist unit itself work's very well and I am very impressed with the ability of the Forerunner 305 to receive satellite signal's,even on heavy overcast day's! However,I am experiencing,what I believe,is a simple problem with Garmin's ""Training Center"" PC software that is included with the Forerunner 305. After I had made NUMEROUS attempt's to E-mail my question to Garmin Customer Support,I have come to the conclusion that Garmin does not want to be bothered with their customer's technical question's! So,in conclusion,when my GPS unit eventually become's inoperable,I will not bother Garmin with anymore of my money!"
4,Great product but battery life poor,"I have enjoyed working out with this watch. It has helped me get ready for three triathlons so far with more to come. I like that it can be configured for running or biking, with several screen options embedded. The heart rate monitor has worked great for me and I like to download my training into the computer.On the flip side, the battery life is still poor. This thing needs to live on the charger between workouts - I cannot get two workouts in a row without charging the battery. Wish they would address that problem."
3,Caution: does not work indoors,"This product does not work indoors - if you exercise on a stationary bike or run on a threadmill or an indoor track, the calory consumption will be recorded as zero. Your heart rate will still be shown in real time, but you will not be able to download the profile of your workout.The way around this is to purchase a sensor that attaches to your foot for $100, which is a bit steep."
1,Finger of Steel needed to push the buttons,Borrowed from a friend - I am giving it back. The manual is terrible. The screens are very hard to read. The heart rate is so tiny I can barely see it. The buttons are so hard to push it is ridiculous.
1,Watch the price closely,"I found this item today at lunch, and decided to purchase it. I was on my cell phone (can't access Amazon from my work PC), so I decided to get it when I got home. Unfortunately when I got home the price had increased by $60. It was $153.94 just five hours ago, now it is $211. I am writing this to let everyone know Amazon can make money selling it at $153, so if you are paying more they are making a killing on you. Good news is I found it on the Sears website for $149.99. :)"
2,gps not suitable for austalia,the item is not suitable for use in australia where it was intended for a gift. i speak in regards to the gps. it was not purchased for the intended us
5,Definitely worth the $,"Yes this is entry level but it does everything I can imagine to help me keep on track with running. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is starting out, restarting or just not professional.On a side note-the first one I got had some issues and effectively died/locked up on first use out. BUT, when I contacted Amazon they were INCREDIBLE about it and the exchange required less effort from me than if I had done it at the store down the street. PLUS they sent the replacement item overnight!"
5,Wow,"It just came today, and of course it suddenly became time to go for a run. It's simple, works as advertised, and had no trouble picking up a signal in the urban canyon of Chicago before I hit the lake. Once home, uploading the data to MotionBased.com was quick. And it logs everything, with maps (including export to Google Earth), times, heart rate, etc. All presented in slick digestible graphs and charts. Tres cool. Actually useful. I picked it up so I could train _right_ for the marathon this year. All in all, I'm extremely happy with this gizmo, which I think will provide the birds eye view of a multi-month training plan I've been looking for.Oh, and MotionBased.com provides mac support! Take that Garmin. Garmin will supposedly offer a mac version of their software later this year, but I don't see myself using it given what MotionBased has to offer."
4,Garmin 305,"Completed multiple searches on many watch/GPS products for running before selecting this model. Positives are its ease of use, its large overall screen (its relatively easy to take a peek to see where your at without stopping.) and finally pricing was reasonable.During many recent events, have made a point of checking out what other runners were wearing and overwhemingly this model is the most worn..Happy with the product and would recommend highly."
3,One problem,"If you are using this to train for distance running, chances are the audio will fail within a year. I returned the unit and had it repaired the second one did the same thing. I suggest a 405 or other model that isn't subject to this type of problem. Audio comes in handy when you are doing yasso 800's or tempo runs."
5,Garnin Foreruuner,I love this product! I had the 403 prior to this watch. The touch screen on the 403 shorted out and satellite lost signal. I highly recommend this watch
5,Garmin Forerunner Exceeds Expectations,"I have had this ""gizmo"" for about a month and am extremely impressed. It worked right out of the box with no problems. I have used it for running and mountain biking and found it extremely easy to use. The wealth of information that it tracks is astounding. I have used a Polar RS200D with a footpod for the last year and got a little frustrated with its inability to correctly track speed on a changing terrain - it's fine for flat surfaces but then has to be recalibrated when the terrain changes. No such problems with the Garmin.I have used the Forerunner with the MotionBased and TrainingPeaks websites and found it very easy to do so. Both websites require some additional downloaded drivers and/or software in order to work but it was worth the extra effort. The mapping capability of this device when used with Motion Based is absolutely amazing! This ""gizmo"" blows away my Polar as far as information tracking, usability, and flexibility goes."
4,best of the best,"For the price, why not. I can track my calories burned, pace, and so much more. I can upload all my stats into my pc and analyze my data. A must get if you are serious into competing"
4,Happy I bought it!,"I was unsure about buying this, but am happy with my purchase. I am new to trail running and found that I really needed this to track my distance. It is overall easy to use after getting used to the functions. It is a bit big, so if your a petite, it will seem HUGE on your wrist."
4,Garmin 305 Gets 4/5,"Pros:-Great display screen & display options-I ride/run in tree covered areas... never lose GPS signal, great GPS-Optional cadence meter works well with the 305-Lightweight and comfortable when I run, mounts to handle bar w/polar bracket-Quick Satellite link-up, before your done stretching, the Garmin 305 is ready to goCONS:- Calories burned function does not seem accurate... on rides where I have been burning 12-1400 calories, the Garmin says I'm burning 5500 cals... I don't think so!-would be nice if software had a calendar display option."
3,"It does what it says, the only thing is the slow satellite capture at start","I have been using the Forerunner 305 for almost 5 weeks, I really like it so far.ProsThe features at the Garmin Connect page are great and easy to use.The HRM band works really well.The watch does everything as advertised.ConsThe only thing that I started to hate is the time that it takes to launch the GPS and to catch satellites, it takes between 9 and 12 minutes, during 5 of those minutes I am running on the street close to buildings but after that I am on an open air.The look and feel of the Training Center is a bit old (like Windows 98 or something like that.No connection between Garmin Connect and the Training Center."
5,Awesome!,"If you are a runner this is a must! I am training for a 1/2 marathon using the run/walk method and this has been awesome. It has many different options for workouts and the screen display options covers all you can possibly need. A little tricky at first to set up but afterward, a piece of cake. You can upload your activities to monitor your pace, mileage, etc. Even if you are just running short distances the GPS and workout/training options are terrific."
5,Just what I was looking for.,I'm a walker (3-5 miles at a time with varied routes) and a jump-rope addict. It's perfect for both. I use it to make sure I'm keeping pace with my walking and see how far I've gone. When I jump-rope I use the interval timer to be sure I'm jumping for a certain amount of time and resting for a certain amount of time. I also use the heart rate monitor when I jump-rope to adjust my workouts. Great tool.
4,Value for money!!!,I had wanted to buy the Fr110 but it was selling at USD199 without the heart rate monitor. I also read that the FR110 had some issues with waterproofing. I then decided to buy the FR305 which I know has an older GPS chipset and a whole lot bigger. I have tested the FR305 outdoors and it picks up a signal within a minute or so except once while I was in Auckland with very cloudy conditions it took me a good 5 minutes to lock on a signal. The controls and functions are really good if you are a cyclist and a runner like me. I also take it out during my hikes and horse riding. The only thing is the size can get to you because it's really huge and trust me you will feel it on your wrist while you run. But for USD128 inclusive of a heart rate monitor...It's a great deal!!!
4,Multi-sport watch?,"I thought this was truly a multi-sport watch...that I could use in Triathlons, but you can't swim with this watch. My other HRM can be use to swim with, and I use that one to train, but in a race, I want a watch that I can use for all three events - not only two.It's great for running and cycling, and I would recommend it, but I can't describe my disappointment regarding the swim aspect. If anyone has a suggestion on how to overcome this problem, let me know."
4,Great watch but slow GPS synch and huge size,"This is a nice watch with good functionality. It will improve your running. I have two major irritations: 1) it takes forever to synch with satellites, 2) it is silly huge."
3,Just ok for me,This monitor doesn't calculate calories burned if the gps is not activated. I had to buy an additional monitor (polar) for strength training and indoor use. It is excellent for outdoor running and biking.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Used this item 2 times before it quit working. Originally thought it was because I hadn't used it for awhile. So, I charged it for a couple of days. Went to run today, battery showed full charge, turned it on and it just kept shutting off on me. Then, the connectors started shocking/burning my wrist.I actually like the unit very much, except for the quality and reliability. When it did work, I very much liked the displays and the heart rate monitor. All seemed to be very accurate. Maybe I just got a lemon."
5,The tether is off,"Simply stated, the Forerunner -- like all running GPS units, I'm sure -- has essentially removed the tether from my runs. Now I'm not bound to pre-measured runs, which was very limiting. Instead, I can add side streets to bump up mileage on days when the running's easy and idle back a bit on days when it's extremely hot or I'm feeling flat. Satellite linkup can take a couple of minutes, but I run on a lot of wooded trails and camp roads with overhead foliage and I never lose lock when it's been established. The display is large enough to read easily and while not truly intuitive, the unit is pretty easy to figure out. The size appears to be an issue -- it does look bulky -- but you don't even notice it when you're wearing it. A great training tool I can't imagine running without."
4,"Good Product, Disappointed with the lifespan","I love the watch , love the functions. After 1 year and 6 months, the watch batt lasts 2 hrs.. totally disappointed!"
2,Garmin's policy on product life is a joke,"I've been a 305 user for the last 3 years. 2 friends of mine and myself bought 3 devices to use them in our Marathon training programs. Another friend of mine had already bought the 205 model (the same as the 305, but w/o the heart rate monitor). Now, after 3 years of use, all 4 are not working AT ALL, because of dead batteries. The joke is that you cannot replace them. When they die, you simply throw your 305 to the garbage. Furthermore, during these 3 years, one always had problems with long races, ultras or trail marathons that would last over 7-8 hours. As I read, Garmin is still using the same philosophy for other similar products, like the Garmin Edge 305HR (bike) or the new 405.It's a pitty that such an anti-ecological policy prevails, for a product that, otherwise, is very good for outdoor sports, running, biking even skiing (but not triathlon). I hope that Garmin changes policy, cause until then they have lost 4 customers."
3,Expensive Toy,"I really liked my Garmin - for as long as it lasted. I paid $159 in October 2009, so I got 2 years out of it. During that time, I had about 4-5 incidents where the watch apparently just shut off in the middle of a run. Yes, it was fully charged and I could never find a reason for the malfunction. Another problem was that the chest strap was way too big for a petite woman. I would have to use safety pins to keep it in place but even then it wasn't snug enough to register heart rate consistently so I just gave up on it. I would have been better off with the Garmin 205 because of that. However, all that being said, I found it was a wonderful running partner. I loved being able to download all the stats from my run and those numbers kept me motivated to improve time and distance. I would not buy this watch again - from reviews I've read I'm not the only one with the problems I mentioned and it is just way too much money for what you get in return."
1,Do your homework before buying this watch,"I bought the Garmin 305 watch a little over a month ago and was my first foray into a GPS watch. I initially loved the watch and was very pleased with the results. After my 12th run with the watch it went completely dead. I tried all of the ""hard"" and ""soft"" resets and scoured the internet for solutions to the problem, to no avail. The watch will now only turn on when it is resting in the cradle and as soon as I take it off, it dies. Amazon was great and agreed to let me return and receive my money back, but I will not be buying another Garmin watch. Any suggestions for an alternate???"
4,great for outdoor workouts,"Love this monitor for outdoor workouts. Takes about 2 min without moving to find satellites and then the readings are great, accurate distance, speed, calorie burn.Didn't realize when I bought it that it's not good for indoor workouts without buying extra accessories. Calorie burn is only calculated when the GPS is active outdoors so if you're looking for something to calculate calorie burn on indoor workouts, this is not your product.Supposedly you can buy a foot pod or subscribe to some gym fitness evaluation for $160, the price of the whole product, just to get it to work indoors.Also does not sync with the machines at the gym the way Polar does, so machines just read 0 for heart rate.Really great for outdoor workouts only though."
5,TimetoRun,This product fulfilled my needs as a runner. It is easy to operate and it helps me to keep my pace and more importantly lets me know how far I have run.
5,Great way to track and improve your running,"I love this thing! I did not realize that you can customise the display until I called support who by the way were very helpful. I don't wear glasses when I run so having a big display is very helpful. There are certain bits of info I want to see and because you are able to customise the display you can have what you need to see on your screen. 1 to 4 pieces of info. If you only have one display, it is very large and covers the whole screen. Now that is what I needed! The only thing I did not like was there is no way to turn up the volume when the alerts go off. I'm an old rock and roll fan and my hearing is not like it used to be. I can still hear the alerts but have to focus more to hear them. Very excelent product. I recommend this one. Garmins newest unit vibrates!"
4,"Decent unit, could use some improvement though","Works pretty well and does what I wanted it to do. The instantaneous slope function doesn't seem to work too well -- often briefly shows me doing a negative incline when I'm actually doing a >10% grade up. It might have to do with my arm strides, I'm not sure, but clearly some kind of fuzzy logic could compensate for this type of thing. The software they provide has horrible map coverage (an irony considering the company that makes this) so I'm forced to use a 3rd party app, which works pretty well and is free."
2,Great training tool... when it works.,"I have been frustrated with the Garmin 305. The first day i wanted to use it on a run it didnt pick up any satelites. It worked for my next three workouts, but then for no apparant reason it wouldn't turn on. I know it was charged from the night before and was not on prior in the day. In fact, when left in the portal it usually displays a message that it is charging or that the charge is complete; this time nothing. When it works its great... great data, feedback, the pace runner. But twice now it has failed to live up to expectations for as much as these units cost. I would have given this a 1 star, but it does have nice features when its working. I read someone else had similar issues and was on his third watch from Garmin before he got one that worked right. I sure hope it doesnt take me that long."
4,great fitness toy,"It gives you everything you want to know of every training session, hr, altitude, total ascent, speed, average speed, etc, etc,4 data field in each screen, durable battery, important to recharge it after long rides.Interval training useful tools.I don't use it a lot for Navigation, but the basics are excelent for mtb long rides.With tools like inmotion, you can download a picture of your last ride and see it in your pc.Much lighter than the 301, but still a little heavy for a 10 or 15k race,To me, calories are pretty accurate in running sessions, but too high on the bike."
2,Poor Quality,"About two months after purchasing the unit, the screen started going black in the middle of work-outs. This happened on about four different occasions. Soon thereafter, the alert sounds began to get so quite as to be useless. I continued to use it because I wanted to get through the marathon I was training for before returning it. During the first mile of the marathon, it lost its signal.Finally, I returned it to Garmin. They rapidly replaced it with a refurbished unit. About three weeks later, the Mode button started malfunctioning (working only intermittently) on the refurbished unit. I'll get another one under warranty, but how long will this one last? If the same design were manufactured with some attention to quality, I would rate it five stars."
4,A great training addition,"OK, lets face it, you can run without this item but it sure does add to it and give your friends and other runners some toy envy. Having the ability to set laps and track time for each (I use miles) gives you a documented history of your performance.Only con I can give it is it can take a while to sync up to satellites initially especially downtown (Boston), which can frustrate people you are running with more than yourself."
3,Awesome watch - at first,"The watch was just awesome - at first. The Heart Rate monitor worked much better at measuring my effort than just my pace; pace will go down when going up a hill, but Heart Rate can keep you at the same level of effort.But after owning it for less than two months, the watch will not turn on, even though it has a full battery.I was given a one-time exception to return the watch even though I'm now beyond the 30-day return window.I will use my credit to get another 305, but I am going to use the watch hard and often for the first couple of weeks to make sure it too isn't defective; if you choose to get this watch, I would suggest the same."
5,Just what I was looking for,The Forerunner 305 is lightweight and easy to use. It's perfect for my needs. I was afraid that it would be too big for my thin wrist and too heavy for longer runs. I was wrong on both counts. It's well worth the expense.
1,Garmin 305 planned obsolesence?,"I have been running with my Garmin 305 about 1.5 yrs. About 3 months ago, a mysterious swiggle appeared on the screen (under the glass) that blocks about 1/3 of the watch face. Last month I noticed the average lap pace was no longer accurate. This week I discovered my watch is no longer transmitting my run history to the on-line website, even though I keep current on software updates. I assumed the data was being uploaded because the synch was working. Result - loss of all runs and bike rides over the last six weeks. Garmin won't replace my unit since it is out of warranty. In my opinion the watch lifespan is too short for the high cost of the watch."
1,Very Disappointed,"I received my Forerunner 305 for Christmas 2008. Unit is chunky on a small wrist which you could overlook if the performance was better.Initially I kept losing satellite reception which I realize may not be a ""garmin"" issue, but it forced my computer to time out.But the software was difficult to install and the maps required a ""purchase"" for the motion based upgrade. Maps are hard to decipher and I did not find the support to be user friendly."
5,Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS,I am very satisfied with the product that I purchased and would recommend it to other runners.
3,Good ... but complicated,"This is for the serious athlete. It has many more options than I require, which makes it a little complicated for me."
2,Just too big,"I felt like I was wearing a corsage, running late to junior prom. Switched to a gps-based workout tracker on my smartphone (Strava). It does all the things I wanted this watch to do, but from a phone I already have (no extra cost) and already run with as an mp3 player (no extra weight)."
3,Lasted 1 year,"I received this for Christmas about 1 year ago. The band started to split within 1 month, but held up for the entire year. The screen only works intermittently. If it starts out ok, it tends to go blank or partially blank within the first 10 minutes. It has been like this consistently since the Garmin was 11 months old. The unit works, the data uploads even without the screen.I expected a more longevity for the price."
3,"Nice Features, Terrible Satellite Reception","When I first got this watch back in the summer, it worked great! I could set my pace, track my daily runs, and measure my heart rate. It picked up on the satellites right away (the longest was a minute). However, the battery life is very short. I would run with it one day (with it on for no longer than an hour) and turn it on the next morning for another run and it would say ""Low battery.""6 months later though, it takes forever to latch on to satellite reception. I finally figured out I can still start the time if it hasn't acquired satellites but it loses the first 10 minutes of my mileage. Nothing has changed over the 6 month period (i.e. I didn't move, no large buildings built). If anyone has feedback as to how to fix this, I would appreciate it."
4,size doesnt matter with this watch,"This ""watch"" is worth the clunkiness (and my wrists are incredibly small). I love mine and have only begun to explore the various ways to use it. It shows all the stats of a treadmill in fresh air. This is the perfect device for a multisport athlete. I've purchased the cadence sensor and bike mount for next summerThe only downsides to this item besides the size is the time it takes to load satelites and the heart rate strap was uncomfortable for me with a small frame. I do plan on purchasing the soft heart rate strap in the near future."
4,The Forerunner 305,"I really like the HR function on this. I think the strap is comfy and secure. As for the GPS, I hope and feel like it is accurate. Still getting use to using the product."
4,Reviewing the Garming Forerunner 305,"It is a good product. The GPS functionality is awesom. The pace counter, the distance and timer functions, the virtual partner, the heart rate monitor, all these are cool features and work well.However, the calorie counter is a joke, they should disable that feature... After an hour run, it told me I used 1200 calories... please! And the Altitude meter is bogus too. And so is the gradient measurements. It is better to disable these than sell features that don't work. Come on Garmin, what happened?But these are not the main features of the device that I use anyway... I use the timer, HRM and GPS features, and they work well. I would have given this product 5 stars if all advertised features worked. But now I give it 3.5 - rounded up, it becomes 4."
4,Garmin Forerunner 305,"The product is good. The GPS antenna is better than previous versions, but still needs some improvement. In some locations the recorded position is still out of the target. The whatch is a little big, mainly because of the antenna"
1,12 month warranty and at 14 monthis it DIES!!!,"Bought it just over a year ago for my wife. She has used it often over the past year for training and various triathlons and marathons. It apparently worked great and she has been very happy with it.Then today, for her last, long, training run before a 27 Mar 2011 marathon at White Sands, it just would not start. No display what-so-ever, no indications; pushing buttons had no effect. Tried charging more, tried hooking the USB to the PC, tried staring at it very hard, NO results!After having read the many 1-star and 2-star reviews on here about folks having the same issues, I have decided to find a highly recommended competitor product and spare myself the heartburn and rage of dealing with what I have determined to be a hateful, sorry, corrupt, and anti-social customer service department for an over-hyped, under-engineered piece of CRAPOLA!!!Garmin, get your act together or quit peddling your cheap, Tiawan-made crap here in the US!"
1,pc compatable???? NOT!!,"Not an item to be used with a pc for the tracking downloads. had to remove Garmin software from pc, it kept locking my pc down!"
3,Using it for the past 2 weeks,"I bought this device 2 weeks before and out of the box it was not working the way it should. Some of the problems that I faced are :[1] 30mins for a Satellite connection[2] 30mins for Heart Rate Monitor to display data[3] Calorie reading way more than what it should be.I checked the website and found that mine had an older firmware and GPS software. I downloaded the WebUpdater which lets you update the devices software/firmware automatically. After updating the device, it seems to be showing correct info.Now, I'm beginning to enjoy the device. I encourage those who have problems with the device to update to the new firmware/software.However, the following features, in my opinion would be very helpful:[1] Wind Velocity[2] Wind Chill Index[3] Temperature[4] Humidity.[5] Web Based utility to configure the system.The first 4 features, I felt, would be very useful in comparing various runs.Gopi"
2,Not great for those walking,"When I run, it is usually on a treadmill. I was looking for something that would help me stay in my target heart rate no matter what activity I was doing. I am a bit overweight and dont want to risk a heart attack. But this item is designed more for runners/bikers. There isn't even an option to walk. And it won't track calories indoors.I am not a frequent runner. When I am outdoors I am usually rock climbing or walking."
1,Don't Bother,"Purchused a new Garmin 405. The battery life is poor. Has to be recharged after ever run, even a short one. The timer stops for no reason. Garmin support is only available during the work week, which is difficult for some of us to do. The read out for the heart rate is so small it is difficult to read while you are running. It lacks a pace function which I prefer over a MPH reading. I would not purchase this watch, look at Polar or a different Garmin model."
4,Makes running more fun,"Using the 305 and Garmin Connect,a free downloadable software application, you're able to upload, map and review your runs. With data on elevations, heart rate and speed this makes tracking progress easy and running more fun!"
4,Really like it!,"This is my first GPS type device and I really like it! Now, I am free to walk/run all around the area and can get the exact mileage. This eliminates me having to go on the same route day after day just because I know what that mileage is. I never used the heart rate monitor (yet) so I can't comment on that feature. The basic workout display is easy to use and I like the interval beep that tells me when to switch from walking to running. I am still unsure about the software as I did install the CD but it is not very user friendly. Now, I don't do my walk/run without it!"
4,I don't know what I did before I had my Garmin,The product is amazing. Sometimes it takes a little while to locate a satellite but I leave it on my window sill while I'm getting ready so it has time to connect. There are so many features and all are very easy to use. I haven't tried to HRM feature yet but plan to do so soon.
3,Frustrated w/ length of time to locate satellite after being indoors,This is a really cool watch. I like the addition of the cadence sensor. The heart rate monitor fits great. But it is annoying waiting up to 5 minutes after going outdoors to retrieve the satellite. It is twice as annoying for work out buddies.
2,Great -- if you run on the tree-less tundra,"I've used it for a few runs on a parkway with trees and have only been able to get the GPS to work once. Standing the SAME spot two days in a row, and it found satelites after about 5 minutes one day and not at all the second. I haven't been able to get the heart rate monitor working either, even after changing the battery and making sure the straps are wet. When I did get it working for one of the three runs, I did like the usability and the display. However, it's pretty much a paperweight if you can't get the GPS working. It's great if you run out in the barren plains but forget about nice Midwestern runs along lakes. Buyer beware!"
4,a good choice,"Overall I'm happy with this purchase, especially for being less than $150. I wanted a device to help keep track of my runs and bike rides so that I can workout smarter. This is my first heart rate monitor.Since I live in Brooklyn, NYC I have sometimes waited several minutes for the Garmin to locate a satellite, and I anticipated this would be the case. While I believe the heart rate is accurate when I'm exercising, I do wonder about the heart rate accuracy after recovery and when resting. I was surprised to read my heart rate was 39 while leisurely walking around after a run. (Is this possible?)I have very slim wrists, and while the unit is bulky, I don't find it uncomfortable. I have yet to take advantage of all the training functions (I'm not good with maneuvering all the buttons and functions), but for a straight GPS/heart rate monitor, I find it to be a solid choice."
4,Good Value for Money,great devise for running/walking through the trails. Combined with sites like Wikiloc or Trailguru it provides a great way to log and share your outdoor activities.
2,Installing software is a nightmare. It didn't conect to my PC...,"I tried hard last night to install the Training Center software and drivers, but always the instalation screen freezes over. I tried by cd and website, and the same happened when it reachs 44% done. I thought it would be simple to connect to my PC and transfer data but... it is a nightmare for sure."
5,GARMIN 305 FORERUNNER GPS,"THE SIMPLICITY AND SENSITIVITY OF THE GARMIN 305 FORERUNNER MADE THIS A VERY USEFUL TRAINING TOOL FOR A RUNNER TRAINING FOR A MARATHAON. INITIALLY, I THOUGHT THE GPS WOULD HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THE SATELLITE IN MOUNTAINOUS AND TREE COVERED TRAILS, BUT NOT ONLY DID IT QUICKLY LOCATE THE SATELLITE BUT SEEMED TO MEASURE DISTANCE AND SPEED VERY ACCURATELY. THE HEART RATE MONITOR I USE SOME, BUT HAVE NOT USED THE OTHER DATA SUCH AS AVERAGE SPEED, FAST AND SLOWEST PACE AND ETC IN MY TRAINING. THIS 305 DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO AND DOES IT WELL."
3,Forerunner,"The item purchased didn't work 100%. The ""enter"" buton doesn't function. Now, I can use the Forerunner, but not the way I expected to. I could not replace it because it was delivered to my wife in a hotel in USA, and she is back already. Also and unfortunatelly, I will not ask for refund because, beeing here in Brazil, I will not buy another one at the same price I found with the delivery in USA. So...Thanks,Ricardo"
4,"Excellent Exercise Tracker, good value","I received the Forerunner 305 for Christmas and am very pleased with it so far. I'm not an avid runner, but do enjoy hitting the streets. The 205 is a very good value, but with the heart-rate monitor on the 305 you can track your workouts even better.I was very pleased that Garmin provides their software Mac friendly, it's very much appreciated. I would have given the 305 a 5 star rating if the battery life was a little better. I'd hate to see it get any bigger because of that though."
2,Works as a GPS,"The GPS works great, however I cannot get the heart monitor to work reliably. It works one day then not the next. Way to much money for just a GPS"
4,Garmin 305,"Works great. After each couple of activities, it is important to recharge the watch as I notice the charge doesn't last for more than a few workouts."
4,Garmin 305,Great product a little tricky to figure out but once you have it down it is a breeze to work with. Great training tool
5,Favorite running purchase!!!!!!!! Until it quit working!!,"I am so happy that I bought this!! I hate to run without it. I use my Garmin on every run. I love that I can run wherever I want without worrying about the mileage. I also like to know what kind of a pace I am running so that I don't tire out too early on long runs. I have not yet used the heart rate monitor, but am looking forward to the information it can provide also!Update..........on February 5, 2009, 8 months after I purchased this, it just quit working. It was on before I left my house and when I went to start my run, it was just dead!! I have put in back on the charger, still nothing. I put my daughter's on my charger hoping the charger was just broke, nope, my daughter's came right on. I can't find any information on what to do if something just breaks way after the 30 day return window!! Help!!! I can't run without the feedback anymore!!!"
4,Garmin,The Garmin 350 has worked very well for me. I use it to go running and walking. I love it! Have not had any trouble so far.
4,"Garmin 305, a perfect running companion",My older son has the 305 and my younger son (15) just received one for Christmas. Both run Cross-country & track and love the 305. They wear it for all practice runs and enjoying sharing post run results and statistics with each other.
4,Forerunner 305,"Also have a 301. Like: Greater number of read outs, greater flexibility of setup, greater ease of data upload, better heart rate monitor. Dislike: Band isn't as comfortable, 301 history easier to read. Suppose to be more sensitive GPS, but don't really see it."
4,Great for beginners,"Garmin's are a great product for training in running. I think devices especially with heart rate monitors are a great tool for beginner runners because it teaches you how to pace yourself and how to maximize training to get more into the sport. Also, the GPS is awesome and a great way to show off your workouts!Also, the TrainingPeaks free trial is awesome because the website allows you to stay responsible and effectively helps you achieve your long-term training goals in your fitness journey."
3,Poor GPS reception in Manhattan; clutters running experience.,"I stopped using this device altogether because it can't locate GPS satellites where I start my runs in New York City (Midtown Manhattan) due to the tall buildings.I often found myself waiting and worrying about trying to get a satellite location rather than focusing on the actual run.The included software for reading your GPS data is also antiquated and confusing.The heart rate monitor function works very well, better than a cheaper Timex model I previously owned. But I'd rather have a standalone HRM with a smaller watch since the GPS doesn't work for me.Could be a fun product in areas with GPS reception."
4,garmin forerunner 305,"As a GPS, it functions great.Fits on small wrists without being ridiculously bulky.I was hoping to be able to use the HR feature; however, the number is so small you can't see it without bringing the monitor close to your face. I use my garmin for rowing pieces so this isn't really an option. It can also be difficult to see when I am biking."
2,Buyer Beware!! - Garmin is not going to stand by product!!,"The Garmin Support remains AWFUL. When the unit is working, its mostly fine. (A bit glitchy, but OK.) Its when it goes blank, that you are in trouble. They will not stand by their product. You will make multiple calls to customer service, until you actually have the 45 minutes to wait for a rep. Then you will be told that although the unit is only 13 months old, the warranty is one year. That's it! Send in the unit with your check for ~$100, and hope for the best. I have had 3 Polar watches over the last 30 years. They all still worked when I upgraded to newer models. I only upgraded for enhanced features. It was a big surprise to see how delicate the Garmin units are. And how the company FAILS to stand behind the product. Buyer beware."
4,Excelent!,"Great precision. Good screen. When we get a long way under trees, gps follow us. And them, when imput in the computer, all program is sent auto."
5,Great Product!,"Overall, it's a great product. Quality materials. Highly functional.Key Features:-Heart Rate Monitor strap is comfortable and the HR data is accurate.-GPS takes about 20 seconds to lock in when you turn it on.-Autolap every mile is a great feature that keeps you on track.-3 different display screens that you can configure and autoscroll lets you control what data you see during your workout.-Training Center and MotionBased software is ok. I prefer SportTracks since it's more flexible."
4,Love it and use it a lot here. But not good for some other countries,"I bought one for myself.I run with it all the time. I only use simple functions and I have no complain.The function I use most often is the interval training function (run x min and then walk y min)It shows distance, time, speed, heart rate, calories burned, etc very clearly.I am very satisfied with it.However, I probably didn't read some descriptions well.I was all excited and bought this back home (to Taiwan) to my father.And then I realized it was sooooo difficult to get signal there.... (only succeeded once or twice...)I believe it will work very well for a lot of countries (it has a lot of lanugage choice), but still please check first if you are going to use this in other countries."
4,Awesome,The way it functions are set up are easily manageable. For the price its a great power buy. I'm all about saving money. The way the chart tracks the everything is great. I use it to follow a training plan to improve my soldiers run time and its been a great asset.
1,Garmin Forerunner 305,"The Garmin Forerunner 305 has two MAJOR problems. First, Garmin's algorithm for altitude recording is poor. It apparently records every foot of elevation it thinks you gain or lose. Since there will always be some measurement error in altitude, you could run a mile on a track and the Garmin Forerunner 305 will say you've done 300 feet of elevation when you're done. I've had Polar and Avocet altimeters and both gave accurate readings on known elevation climbs. The Garmin typically doubled the true elevation gain!Garmin's bigger problem is customer service. After using the Forerunner for two weeks, I had a software problem and emailed Garmin's customer service. No response. I emailed again. No response. After five emails over four weeks with no reply from Garmin I gave up and returned the Forerunner.Until Garmin gets some customer service, I'd advise getting a Suunto or another brand."
1,Lasted one year,I used the Garmin Forerunner 305 for just about a year. It worked great and was very helpful for tracking my runs but then it just stopped working. The software that came along with the watch now can not recognize the watch. I have tried several recommended fixes and none of them work. A one year life span is pretty weak.
5,Precise!,"An accurate and useful item for beginners and advanced runners. Full of informations in rating each zone and marking exactly where it happens. The program that comes with is helpful, although outdated (2006). About the size, it don't compromise its use, maybe in long runs. I recomend."
3,"Love the features, hate the reliability","I love the features on my forerunner, enough that I am very unhappy when I have to run without it. That is why it is so frustrating that it is back in the shop again, second time this year. I've only had it for eleven months.When I called this time they asked me if I had gotten it wet. I wanted to say, um, do you know what this product is supposed to be used for? I love it, I just wished it didn't break so easily. Its not like I swim in it, or even run in the rain if I can help it. But I can't not sweat!Garmin Forefunner 305 Training Assistant"
3,Calorie Counter Fiasco is a Black Eye for Garmin,"Owned for 6 months. Bought watch for GPS function w/ large display and calorie counting capability. I'm very satisfied with the quickness, accuracy and usefulness of the GPS training aids. Not so happy with the short battery life. VERY unsatisfied with worthless calorie calculation. Hugely disappointed that Garmin hasn't responded to this problem, other than correcting the misstep in later watch models.Great if Garmin did at least one of the following:1)provide a firmware upgrade for the 305, or2)provide a PC software calorie calculation to apply to the uploaded HR data, or3)added a truthful caution to 305 advertising: ""Warning: watch calorie calculation is inaccurate for all sports, and is disabled for indoor activity"""
4,Neat Running Tool,"I wish I had the Garmin Forerunner 305 five years ago when I started running. It's easy to set up, the menus are clear, and the features are useful. It would be perfect if the heartrate display was 2 to 3 times larger for quick glances and the side buttons were easier to press. The pace reading doesn't update as quickly as my cell phone's SportsTracker app does but it is possible that I simply haven't figured out which settings to change for that yet. You can set it to beep at predefined distances, speed ranges, or heartrate ranges. You might not be able to hear the beeps if you're listening to music while running (but there may be a volume setting that I haven't found yet)."
5,so useful.,"great GPS watch. love knowing my current pace when on a run. the mapping featured works perfect once you plug it into your computer.While it is a little bulky, knowing all the features it has explains the size. But it's not so big that it is bothersome. Just ran a half-marathon last weekend and this watch helped me keep pace and set a new PR."
2,Ergo bust for slim wrists,"A small person (5.5 ft, 110 lb) would have to make an elastic padded satin collar or some such. Wore it around house 30 minutes and it chafed that ulnar bump; packed it right back."
4,Exclent GPS Heart Monitoe Foreruner Garmin 305,"You have for a god price for a Excelent gps with Heart Rate Monitor . It' s a little big but confortable and easy to use. Good software for record, historic, and review your excercises"
1,Unhappy Customer,"Either I am not using it correctly, or I'm just plain old unhappy. Here's why:1. The calorie counter doesn't seem to be accurate; according to some deeply hidden reviews, it does NOT calculate correctly.2. The strap lowers and I cannot make it any tighter.3. GPS is good; but I could now just use free APPS on my iPhone.4. To set up runs, it takes a great deal of navigation to get to interval training.5. In summary, it's not user-friendly. My iPhone and the Free Apps (like runkeeper, etc.) are much easier to use.6. Product is really bulky; thought it would be fine. It's not."
4,"Works well, but hard to find a signal","This is the first GPS watch I've ever used. I bought it to use during training runs, since I run several races a year. I like all the features and it works well in general. My only complaint is that it sometimes takes a long time to find a signal when I'm wearing it. I usually have to set it down on a surface outside and leave it for a few minutes for it to work. Besides that, it's pretty awesome."
3,A little disapointing,"It worked great when I first bought it, and survived a pretty big fall on my bike on the first use, but after a couple of years, the GPS just stopped with no warning. First of all it takes it a long time to establish a signal (even when new), and now it sometimes works, sometimes not at all...and the rest of the time it just stops in the middle of my exercise. I have tried resetting it, updating the firmware, and everything else I could think of but to no avail."
1,short product lifespan; worst customer service,Great product while it worked. I've had it for about 18 months when it suddenly died. I've tried everything from reset to software downgrade/upgrade; nothing worked. The customer support suggests to send it in for a repair that costs more than half the price of a new product. Unbelievable..
2,GPS speed is too slow for any good,"experience the same as many reviewers, the GPS speed of this item is just too slow, either in Built-up area or in open park (slightly better), you can expect to wait for up to 10 mins. just to get the GPS catches the signal before you can start your routine."
4,Put some fun in your run,"I have been using my Garmin 305 while going across various parts of Alaska, from cross country skiing down the Iditarod trail to running around my house. I love being able to use Google Earth to show where, how fast, and what my heart rate was during my run. My previous Garmin (101) dropped the satellite signal or didn't pick it for up to 0.5 miles into my run. The 305 picks up the satellite signal better and maintains my pace more consistently. The HRM and GPS function has allowed me to correlate my location, how I am feeling, my actual pace and heart rate information. I actually find that I look for reasons to run outside in the dead of winter instead of inside on a treadmill."
3,Great function -- Bad Form,"The Forerunner has sensational functions. You can track your HR, pace, distance, elevation and more. The idea of training with a HR monitor is that most people spend too much time training in the middle zones and not enough time in the easier and harder zones. The Forerunner gives you all the data you need (but you still need the discipline and the planning to improve your training). The downside to the Forerunner is that is very heavy and uncomfortable on the wrist. I was switching wrists, using padding, etc. The chest monitor is also uncomfortable. It slips down, and if I tuck it under my sports bra, it digs into my ribs. I want to use it every run -- but I don't because it's too uncomfortable for every day."
5,Garmin Forerunner 305 truth detector,"They always tell you when your training to run with a buddy, they keep you honest. No slowing down for hills, no dogging it on the lonely stretches, etc. That's what the 305 does, it becomes your personal electronic training buddy that speaks only the truth, you're fast, you're slow, you're at 5K not 6K, and on and on. The unit takes about 30-60 seconds for GPS satellite acquisition here in the hills of western PA but once locked on it stays rock solid throughout my runs. Even in some pretty narrow gorge areas and through tunnels of 100 feet or less the unit keeps tracking. The auto-pause feature is great so you don't have to remember to stop-start whenever you get held up by cross traffic or tree'd by the neighbors ""friendly"" rotweiller. The history feature and ability to download my run profiles to my PC is a geeks dream. The process was simple and the data was more than enough to show where I needed to focus."
4,Garmin Forerunner,"It seems easy to use at first but when I tried to delay when it started tracking, I couldn't find out how. Operator error probably. A bit bulky but I knew that."
5,"Easy to use, helpful in monitoring miles","This device, the Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor, is my current GPS device for running. I've also tried theGarmin Forerunner 101.I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and capture satellite signals a bit faster, and have the battery last a bit longer... but then I should buy the 405, I assume.I enjoy using the total distance and pace features. I've only used the heart monitor once. I'm interested in exploring the water-repellency a bit, but I don't want to short it out. The claim is that the 305 can be submerged in 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. True?This device is awkward on thin wrists. Jamming a terry cloth wrist sweat band next to it helps.Useful, helpful, and motivating device. In addition to training, it helped me keep up my desired pace in 10 mile and half marathon races (7:00 - 7:15 min/miles).We've now got three of these devices in the family. I guess that says something about whether we trust it!"
1,Fun While It Lasted!,"The best exercise watch I ever had! Could generate amazing graphs for post-run analysis, race against my own PR, and even overlay my runs on GoogleEarth.Unfortunately, after only 13 months of use - 1 month out of warranty, the unit won't turn on. Okay, so I work with Garmin support, and after a few latent iterations (up to 3 business days per response, egad!), my only option is to send it in for repairs. Okay still, except ALL repairs are a flat rate of (gulp) $99.I wish Garmin made the rechargeable battery serviceable by a retailer or jeweler, similar to competing products. I realize that this might not be the problem, but since it appears to be fully functional when powered, it would be a worthwhile $10 test, as opposed to spending half the cost of a new one to get the not-so-old one repaired.Goodbye Garmin! I miss you already!!!"
3,Don't buy the 305; buy the 205,"I have used garmin fitness GPS fitness monitors exclusively since their introduction. About a year ago I upgraded from the 301 to the 305. The 305 does a great job of tracking time and distance as well as well as features like interval workouts & setups. However, the heart rate monitor simple does not work as well as earlier models. The HR monitor most times doesn't work or is ridiculosly inaccurate. I actually sent the product back to Gramin for repair and it still doesn't work correctly. So I recommend that anyone considering Garmin fitnes products that you purchase those products without HR features. hc jones, providence forge, va 23140"
4,Garmin 305 Review,"The Garmin is everything I expected. Its accurate and has a lot of very helpful functions(most that i'm still trying to play with). It's a little bulky but I also have very small wrists. I wear in on my inner wrist or it'll rub on my bone and become irritated. It stays in place fine, even when I get sweaty.When I was setting up my Garmin with my computer for the first time I was having difficulty with my laptop recoginizing that it was attached. It turns out that the USB cord that was sent from the seller was not the proper cord or there was damage to it. There is no Garmin logo or writing on it. I only discovered this after being on the phone with tech support for over an hour, so that was a bit discourging. Garmin has sense sent me a new cord, free of charge.I absolutely love all the information you get when you load your runs to the website!I'm overjoyed with my purchase!"
4,Garemin forerunner 305 forever,This product is really well done and useful for those interested to improve their performances and to get a better awareness about their capacities.Maybe the software associated on PC should be improved to be at the same level.
4,Excellent but does not work with most gym machines,"This excellent device does not couple with gym machines (treadmills, ellipticals, bike machines, etc.). I also have a Polar HRM, and it works with EVERY gym machine I have ever used. It is nice to have both: one for outdoor running and biking (Garmin 305), and one for gym use (including swimming) (Polar)."
5,I love my Garmin GPS!,I was impressed by the speed and efficiency in delivering my Garmin GPS! When I got it I was thrilled with all the features it comes with!It's easy to use and I can record my data in my PC for future adjustments.A real worth-buying!
5,Garmin 305 GPS,Love this Garmin - everything works great. The minor issues: at times getting satellite reception can be a problem & the charging cradle isn't the greatest - doesn't lock in place easily.
4,As Promised,"Both me and the wife use this. She runs, I bike and run. I love how easy it is to use. Didn't give it 5 starts since I wish the batter would last longer. Takes me 10 hours(9:58) to complete LOTOJA. Otherwise its great. No complaints."
5,Great training aid,"I bought this for my wife almost a year ago. The funny thing is that I have used it far more often than her. I use it an average of 3 to 5 days a week to ride to & from work, plus any running races, adventure races, or triathlons that we do on the weekends. Product has held up great. My only complaint is the lack of waterproofing. I wish it was better sealed to go to deeper depths for longer periods. I have put it in my swim cap before & it worked fine. I have never had a problem with water but I usually try to keep it out of the water. Great product for the price."
5,Forerunner 305 is my favorite Garmin,I bought my first Forerunner 305 for cycling and running and after a year the battery died and it was going to cost around $70 to send it back to Garmin so I went to REI and purchased $410 most up to date version which is wireless and returned it after a week. The wireless wasn't nearly as accurate as the 305 and you have to deal with a jump drive so it's one more step. I love the fact that the 305 is still available and REI took my broken one back and returned it to the manufacturer and gave me a credit so it was extra easy for me!
5,Forerunner 305,It was fantastic if you look for one watch that could fit with your multi-sport activities. The function is easy to use and track your performance.
3,"GF305 - Nice product, louzy software","The GF305 works perfect but I had expected more from the software brought with it. Instead I need to explore and use a couple of other software to resolve my needs. I also discovered that it is difficult to get coordinates on display, for example needed if bringing the GF305 on a hike together with an old paper map."
5,Great Heartrate and GPS combined instrument,"I've had trouble with the heart-rate function on nearly all previous similar devices, whether Cateye or Polar. The 305 has served both my wife and I well. Great to have a rechargeable receiver like this."
1,Poor warranty service,"The Up button broke after 3 months of use, never had a fall or even a bump or swim, in fact it may have been that way from the start as I only started to use it fully. Was told it was out of warranty, over a year past the mfg date and would have to pay to get it repaired.I was very excited to get this product based on the reviews, but seems others have had similar problems with repairs.Very poor customer experience."
5,Just What I Needed,"This little device works great. I live and run in a very wooded area, and I was concerned that the tree cover would impede the GPS. But I have never had a problem, no matter where I run. The only thing that doesn't work great is the elevation measurement, but that is not a big concern for me. The unit's size is not a problem -- it's larger than a wristwatch, sure, but it is no hindrance or distraction. I like the large screen; I have set mine to show the distance run, average pace, elapsed time, and current heart rate all on one screen, and I can read it even though I am very far-sighted. And after the run, I just attach it to my computer using the included USB attachment and software, and I have a very accurate record of the entire run. For me, at least, it was definitely worth the money."
4,Great product!,I gave it only 4 stars due to the fact that I really can't read the heart rate number..it's so small in the upper right hand corner. I have to stop running sometimes to be able to see it! If you are strictly training using heart rate..I wouldn't recommend this Garmin. Other than this ..it works awesome. Very user friendly.
5,Don't train without this partner,"Prior to my purchase, I read a very comprehensive review at amazon.com and on the strength of that review and taking the Garmin name into consideration, I purchased this gps/heart monitor combination. In fact, I have already recommended it to three of my buddies who run in other states. As I always run alone, it is nice to have a ""partner"" that helps me keep pace and not over or under train."
5,Garmin that is easy to use and almost foolproof,"I picked this Garmin because I am tired of messing with the ring on my ipod being so fickle. Sometime I can't turn it up or down...and also I can't see it in the sun. With this gps, I can just push a button. The product is easy to see and you can set it many ways. Also, I find mine to be very accurate."
4,best functionality and value for money,"garmin forerunner 305 remains the reference for GPS tracking of your heart rate monitored activities.no extra sensors makes it suitable for all activites: running, biking, skiing, kayaking, trekking - you name it.quite bulky, but nothing you cannot get used to - after all it is a tool, not an accessory.garmin's connect website is awesome with link directly to google earth and not least the player, which let's you replay you route on a map, with indication of speed, heart rate and elevation - way cool."
4,heart rate gps watch,"I think this is remarkable. I can go out and come back and look at what I've done.It is very easy to use. I'm somewhat computer illiterate and this has been understandable for use. I've even used it in my car, just to see what would happen.I really would recommend this for someone who is training."
1,Good Product Does A Toyota,"I've used this product for about six years. The first watch that I used lasted about two years with no problems. The three subsequent monitors have given me a myriad of problems, from no HRM, to failure to charge, to crashing my computer, to failure of information to download. I ordered a unit about six months ago and used it for two weeks before it failed to charge. I sent it back and immediately got another which did the same thing. I don't know if they're dumping the defective monitors on the market or what, but getting two in a row with the same problem may not be coincidental. I highly recommend buying your monitor from Costco or some other local store that will give a full refund for defective gear. Using mail order involves shipping and at least a two week wait for a refund. I have basically been without a monitor for a month because of what seems to be a big drop off in workmanship. For someone who's seriously training, this can be a very long time."
5,Fantastic training device,This is a great training device with a ton of features. It works great and is very accurate. I don't know how I used to run without it.
5,Great gift....,"Very good product. This was a gift for my wife, who is using it every day. Great buy. Regards,"
3,garmin forerunner 305,good product a little big on the wrist which takes some getting used to. the screen is not as easy to read when actually running as i would have liked and it takes a while to get used to all the functions. but overall good.
3,"Accurate, but a bit of a hassle","What I like about the 305 is that it appears to be very accurate in its readings. The user interface is pretty intuitive, which I also like. Garmin has a good website for uploading/viewing your runs yet strangely it's very difficult to learn of this - the instructions with the watch do not mention it, nor does the FAQ for the watch online etc. I had to call them to learn about it the website.One issue I have with the 305 is that it sometimes takes a very long time to locate satellites- it's a bit tedious at the start of a run to be standing around for 5-10 minutes while this thing tries to get synched.I really like that the watch stops the timer when you're stuck at a red light. And I find it more accurate & hassle free than the iphone apps I'd been using previously. Some may find the watch cumbersome, though I don't mind particularly."
4,ECB's GFR305,I love it.I'm using on all my street running training.I recommend.I want to buy a foot pod.[[]] ECB
2,Heart Rate Monitor Feature Did Not Work,"The watch came highly recommended, but I just could not get the heart rate monitor to work. Tried everything. Sorry Garmin."
3,NOT WATER-PROOF !!!,"It does take long to acquire satellites...sometimes as long as 2 minutes...not understandable when I am outside in Denver, Colorado on a clear sky with no trees anywhere around me. Keep in mind that Denver is 1 mile elevation, so less atmosphere for satelites to send signals through.Also, worth mentioning. The merchant is WRONG in calling this water-proof. It is water-resistant. Only the XT version is waterproof."
4,Must have for any runner,I held off reviewing this for a while since I wanted to pound the heck out of it first. I've put TONS of miles on it running and never had a problem. It's easy to set up and use. The software that comes with it is great and easy to use as well. I would recommend this over the newer 405 for any runner/biker/hiker/outdoors exerciser.Pros:Large screen (easy to see)Battery LifeEase of SetupGPS is pretty spot onSoftware featuresCons:Sometimes it takes a LONG time for the satellites to synch up and I find myself waiting to start my runDoesn't always synch all info to computer on the first tryHaven't figure out how to track calories for indoor workouts (like Insanity)
2,Garmin Forerunning 305 internal battery impossible to replace,I purchased a Garmin Forerunner 305 two years ago and recently started experiencing problems with the watch not holding a charge. Imagine my surprise when I discovered there is no easy way to replace the internal battery. You have to know how to solder wires as the battery is connected by wires to the watch. I espected more than two years of usage out of a watch that cost me over $200.00. I will not purchase another Garmin product for running.
2,Only last just a little over a year,The Garmin forerunner 305 lasted a year and about a month. I had to perform a hard reset many times with the watch. There is a one year warranty on the watch then you pay 79.00 for a new watch. I think a 200.00 watch should last more than one year. I didn't get much use of the watch because it kept resetting or losing a signal.You really don't want to purchase this watch. Its a lemon. I had a few other friends on the tri team with the same experience. They are choosing to pay the 79.00. I'm choosing to look at Timex.Garmin Customer service lets you know you are just a number and they don't care if you use their product or not.
5,Great watch...no regrets,I purchased this watch to give me freedom to run random routes and still know my distance. It has proved to be so much more. Things I like: Never loses satelite lock; comfortable; ability to download and analyze workouts; heart rate monitor.Buy this watch!
4,Finds the location relatively fast,"I've used other Garmin products and this one in particular finds the location very fast, making it easier to go out for jogging or on the bike."
3,Too complex for what I needed,"I wanted this basically to tell me how far I've gone (run or bike), my heart rate, and how many calories I burned. I thought I could map a route before I left the house to follow and know how far I was running. If this does those things I never figured it out. It was very complicated. I wanted to be able to track my physical activity over each month and do graphs, etc. I could not find a way to do that either, the graphs I found were useless to me.It seemed more for people who go trail running and might need help finding their way back to where they started. I packed my purchase back up and returned it. Plus this thing is HUGE!"
3,"Super complex, no built in maps","I got the Garmin 305 with HR monitor for my runner wife. Although we had seen pictures and knew measurements, we were surprised by how massive the unit is on a wrist. She had a problem with the HR monitor working only for 15sec and then quitting, but we did a quick winter test run (Chicago sux Dec-Mar for outdoor running) to test it and had no problems with HR timing or downloading to the PC once we returned. The path taken was shown OK, but I thought it would at least put it into on a Google map or Mapquest map to get some reference points, but it has not so far. Also, takes a long time to aquire satellites and must be outside to do it - waiting outside in the cold for the Garmin is not my idea of fun."
5,HIGHLY Suggest Buying!!!!,Great watch and I used it Every Day to run with!!!! LOVE it and all of the details are exactly right!!! Would highly suggest buying!!!
3,Garman 305,"I bought this Forerunner 305 with the heart rate monitor back in Jan 2010. It was easy to use and I liked the computer software for tracking and viewing my routes. It was great to be able to just run without staying on a specified route in order to know how far I was running. Accuracy was pretty good. The only downside is that the battery only lasted about 2-1/2 years. It is NOT user replaceable! After contacting Garmin, they said I could call them to get an RMA to return it so they could replace the battery. This would only cost me $80 + shipping. I only paid about $160 for the watch in the first place. Now I'm in the market for a new watch and will probably buy a different one that has a user replaceable battery."
5,Solid GPS watch,"I'm using this for the past one and half year.No problems so far.I replaced the battery of the heart rate monitor last month.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good gps watch.BTW ,I bought it for $110 and now it is listed for $250.It is the only gadget I saw where the price is going up."
1,BEWARE!!!!!,I was loving the features of this running watch for 4 months before it stopped working altogether. I have had several issues with Garmin. Their Nuvi only last for 8 months before it stopped working. Customer service is slow and repairs are expensive. I would check other products that are better manufactured and have better customer service.
5,Great gift for runner,"I purchased this as a gift for an aerobics instructor, personal trainer and overall fitness junkie. She really likes the heart-monitor and pacing alerts. Everything worked right out of the box. No complaints."
4,Kind of Neat,"If Flavor Flav exercises, this is what he wears, man it is huge. Anyway, enough of that. It seems to work well, I am not techie or interested enough to get to know every single function it has. All I need to know is how far, how long, heart stats and ok, pace. The only problems I have really noticed are a) Make sure you wet the heart sensors before use otherwise it might not work. (I was apparently dead for the first quarter of a mile of my first trot wearing this.) And b) I wish the graphs on the training center could be manipulated properly to get good close looks at things. The compare feature doesn't seem too good, it puts them all on a screen about 2"" square. Must be buried in the manual somewhere! Those minor complaints aside, it is well worth the money for something very functional."
2,The heart rate monitor doesn't work,"Garmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate MonitorI bought my Garmin at October 29, 2010. I used it first time at November 14, 2010. The GPS product is great, but the heart rate monitor isn't.The heart rate monitor worked once and stopped. I changed the battery, I followed all the steps trying to fix it, but the heart rate monitor still doesn't work. Off course I'm not happy with the product. When I buy something new, I'm expect that my GPS and the heart rate monitor are working as well."
5,Luv my Forerunner 305,A non-techie like me has found an easy to use product that has the features I wanted at a very reasonable price.Tks Amazon for great service.
5,Great running companion,"This watch made my half marathon training do-able. It is a bigger watch (compared to just a regular watch) but for all it does, it is very reasonably sized. I definitely recommend something like this to anyone interested in monitoring how fast/far/long they are running."
1,Doesn't pick up GPS signal,"Initially worked well, after a couple years it would not pick up the signal. Sometimes picked up halfway though run, many times not at all. Called Garmin, they only warranty their GPS for 1 yr. Surprising since they are a company built on GPS technology?"
4,Garmin Forerunner GPS,This is a good GPS with more capabilities built in than I will ever use. It works great outdoors but it doen't get a signal well indoors or in heavily wooded areas.
4,Good but Map Sucks!,I love this product but the mapping feature is no good. It never maps the correctly. The lines are way off and they don't include all streets. Hear Rate & Speed are perfect.
1,Heart Rate Monitor Did Not Work,I tired two units and could not get the heart rate monitor to work reliably on either.
1,no customer's service,"I had a Garmin 301. Its usb plug corroded. I contacted customer's service, and they exchanged the device, no questions asked.Since I bought 2 garmin 305, one for me and one for the Miss. I updated gps software on one of them... it's not working anymore. I tried to contact customer's service by sending 3 email for the last 2 weeks... no answer yet."
4,"Great product for running, but not for Gym workout","This product is great for running, but unfortunately the calorie calculation does not include the heart rate in the calculation of calories burned. Especially since this product offers different sport arts, I do not see at all why the code for calorie calculation was not simply extended to calculate the calories based on heart rate as well."
4,This is a great product.,"This is a great product, I run with it back home (Netherlands) and carry it along when I come over to the US for work and run there. I have so many friends that got all excited about it that I keep on getting requests to bring them one. The Garmin Forerunner 305 works pretty easy and the screens are easy to adjust and read."
4,pretty cool,"Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Good mapping of where you've ran. all your running info is displayed on computer to show speeds, distances and time along with routs and heart rate. The heart rate moniter tends to slide around. (could be a big problem for large breasted women) Overall she loves it."
3,Not bad for the price,"The GPS and measurement works great.Lacking of touch screen interaction is a big drawback. Quite difficult to use with the menu system. If I do it again, I would go for the one with bigger screen and easier user interface."
3,Trouble if you have a lot of trees in your neighborhood,"I really want to like this product, but have had too many bad experiences. The data collected is frequently incomplete and it takes a long time (5+ minutes) to link up to a satellite connection before each run. It works better in winter so I suspect that the trees in my neighborhood interfere with the satellite connection. In any event, I like the way it looks and the software."
3,Garmin Forerunner 305,"I have used my Garmin 305 alot since I received it. I like the large numbers, alerts, and the easy download after my run. The heartrate information needs to be larger and when you go outside your set limits the information bar flashes to quickly to see if it is your heartrate or your pace and if it is to high or to low."
4,Fantastic Tool - Only 1 Small gripe,"The Forerunner 305 is great. I love it. It is simple to use and gives me the exact data and functionality I want and need. I have one small complaint. The HR reading is so small, I can't see it while i run. There are no modes that allow you to read the HR in larger font. Other than that, this tool rocks."
4,Awesome gadget for runners,"This was a gift for my wife. Loaded with features. The included software could be better, seems a little dated. The Garmin Connect website is great, thought."
3,Buy with caution if using for indoor treadmill or spinning workout and want to see accurate calories burned,"I purchased this to monitor my Heart Rate and Calories burned while taking indoor cycling classes or running on the treadmill.The Calorie count was not accurate. Waited 3 days for a email from Garmin to explained. Finally called customer service and had to wait 30 minutesto get a representative. After Garmin's explanation, decided to return it back to AMAZON."
4,allround user,"the forerunner 305 is a fine device for running ,skiing and mountainering.It served me well in several outdoor activities without any failure.I can strongly recommend this fine itemi"
1,Dont buy this product,"Sorry I purchased this product; even the guide is way too complicated for a simple workout gps device. Come on Garmin you are way better than this; get someone on line to assist us in a timely fashion, or recall the non-functional items.Import/export of data not as easy as the instruction manual states; and takes way too much time.Use a Roadrunner GPS Program for my Blackberry phone; problem there is the phone is not easy to carry while running, and very few firms make a running pounch. But a far superior program and product to what Garmin has put forth in this product for $130.00 including shipping. Can I return for partial credit?"
4,Ideal for the compulsive runner,"Ideal for the compulsive runner, who wants to know just how far he or she has gone. The accelerometer based instruments just aren't accurate enough.It's really fun to take on an airplane. It works when held up to a window. You can go a mile in 10 seconds.I would like to see an external battery power supply or recharging device. 10 h is not long enough for an overnight trip."
5,Works as advertised,"No complaints so far, all software and hardware works fine. I'm using the Garmin for cross country skiing and on my stair master. Can't wait til spring to use it for cycling, the main purpose for the purchase.G"
1,A terrible mistake,"I sent this e-mail to Garmin ""Customer service"" 2 days ago ( and still no answer from them): After more than 45 min. waiting on the phone I decided to e-mail you. My wife owned a forerunner 301 no problem with heart beat record. I decided to give her a present the forerunner 305 ( big mistake). Before L.A. Marathon she had a lot of problems with the heart beat data, not recording. We read about to make the contacts wet and the use of electro gel, we purchase the gel for the marathon and the big disappointment after the Marathon 90% of the data is not there ( the heart data) and when recorded running at a pace of 10.5 the reading 64 ( too good to be truth).We are really disappointed there is anything that you can do, I purchase the unit on January 24th 2007.Believe it or not still on hold on the phone line your customer service is kind of slow ( 52 minutes and still waiting).Thank you in advanceMariano Perez"
2,Doesn't really track calories burned,"I bought this to track my calories burned while doing workout videos. It doesn't do that, even though it has a heartrate monitor. It uses the speed your traveling to indirectly calculate your calories burned, so if you are working out it can't figure out your calories! I didn't see this listed anywhere prior to purchasing and now I have an overpriced watch that does me no good."
1,This product sucks,I've bought two of these in a row and they both stopped working within a week. This product is complete garbage so don't waste your time or money.
1,"Worked fine for a week, then I lost all my data","I bought this device so that I could track all my workout data on the computer. After downloading all the updates, everything worked fine for the first week. Then the Training Center software simply quit working. When I tried to start it, the program would instantly crash. So for the past week, I have been unable to save any of my workout information. Customer support told me that the only way to fix it was to clear all my data and start over, so I lost everything I had collected.When the software is working as intended, it is still extremely primitive. There are very few options for analzying your data. The option to export workout information creates a file that has horrible formatting, so simply using Excel to create graphs or tables is not possible."
1,305 quality lacking,"Opened up charged overnight, next day went out on ride and 2 hours in my ride it stopped working. Tried re-sets as shown at Garmin web site, but no use it was dead. Next day it was returned."
2,very complicated to use,still reading the manual.seems like a good device to record training sessions but not very user friendly.
2,SPOTTY PERFORMANCE,"I'VE HAD this 305 for one year. problems:1.) you really have to be sweating to get the monitor to pick up your heart rate. That is hard to do sometimes when biking in the winter.mMany times the pick up of the HR is very spotty, even after a new battery is installed.2.) transferring data from the unit to my computer is painstakingly frustrating. The device will state transfer complete and the computer will tell me the device is in a bad state, turn off and plug in again. This happens several times EVERY time I go to transfer data.3.) Like with most of these GPS units elevation is way off.Save your money and get something besides a Garmin."
4,Forerounner 305 do the job,"The 305 is a superb for those who seek for a good strong GPS combined with heart rate monitor and the entire feature you need for your sport activity. It is very easy to upload your logs to your computer sharing and track your activity. I find both Apps useful to work with, Sport Tracker and Garmin Connect.The 305 is not a GPS that will take you where ever you like, it has no maps and his navigation capability is poor.The display is very bright and clear and it easy to setup your own displey.In general this is a very good companion for your sports."
4,Works Great for Hiking and Kayaking,"We bought this to keep track of time and distance while hikng and kayaking. This unit meets all our expectaions. We have not used the heart rate monitor yet or started to record the treks or paddles on line. I would expect those functions would also work fine.We did notice that it may takes a couple of minutes to locate the sattelite when in remote areas. We have not had any problems with lost signals once we have locked on.The battery life seems to be OK. We have not tested to see if it is 10 hrs as claimed. Typically we recharge it after about 5- 6 hrs. We did get a low battery signal once, but the unit kept recording for another hour after the warning.Before buying this we looked at GPS units. We decided that we pretty much stay on marked trails so we did not need maps for our purposes.We recommend this unit for anyone who is interested knowing how far and how long they have traveled and does not need the mapping of a hand held GPS."
5,Garmin forerunner,"Absolutely superb product. Adds a new dimension to training. Equally good for cycling. Although the GPS seems to have the capability for decent navigation, the process to upload routes that you have never ran before is over complicated and takes a while to get used to.Training centre is rubbish. I hope Garmin will improve this in futures versions."
1,1 yr x-box 360 live code didn't work,I am currently deployed and my sons x-box 360 live code had expired. I ordered him a new one on amazon.com and e-mailed it as a gift to him. He tried it and it didn't work. This made me very dissappointed with Amazon.Reference 21152010
1,Very Poor Shipping Service and customer support - Amazon,"Garmin Forerunner 305 Wrist-Mounted GPS Fitness Computer with Heart Rate MonitorAmazon shipping process is very poor. After waiting the required 8 days for delivery and it didn't show up, I was asked to wait an additional 3 days before they could send me another item with maybe 1 day shipping free.The amazon shipping system still shows awaiting USPS to pick up. This is what it said 8 days ago right after I ordered the garmin 305.Now I have been on hold for a long time waiting to talk with a manager. I think they are hoping that I hang up!VERY POOR SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT! I will never order from amazon again.By the way, the product is now $30 more. I believe they are shipping them all to others that are paying more for the item."
2,greatexcept for battery terrible,"Mine goes dead after about 50 minutes even when fully charged, I wish I could return it."
3,Very Nice,Bought this product for training for 1/2 marathon. Overall very happy. Sometimes it takes forever for the watch to find the satellite but would recommend it to others.
5,It works great,"I really can't add anything that hasn't been mentioned. For those wanting it for military purposes, it only displays in Lat/Long. I've taken this bad boy all over the world, and its the best training partner ever."
3,The speaker will die,"If you plan on sweating with the Garmin on your wrist, the beeping speaker will corrode in a year or two. I've had mine for 2.5 years, and it's not audible anymore. You can see more information on this flaw here: [...]Also, Garmin Training Center software is not worth loading. Do freeware SportTracks instead."
1,It won't stay charged,"We bought this for my teenage son, who was wanting to know how far he would run each day. After 2 months, he has been able to use it 3 times. It will not keep a charge. I charge it and by the next time he wants to use it, it isn't charged anymore. And of course, when I went to see about returning it, Amazon says that we can't because the return window is gone. Not good. Still have to get in touch with Customer Service, and hopefully they can give me some guidance for using it and a way to keep the charge."
2,Old Mans comments!,Fine for you youngsters but for old guys like me trying to read HR (miniscule readout) nearly proved fatal - hit a post whilst TRYING to see HR - No fool Like an old one
3,"OK, not great","I don't understand why I continue buying these training watches. I have yet to buy one that works as advertised. There's always an issue with the heart rate signal, the software/firmware, the quality of construction, etc. The Garmin FR305 is no exception. It's built well, has good user interface and navigation control, but the data it collects doesn't get loaded into the computer program accurately. It only loads a part of the heart rate and cadence information. Somehow and for some reason much of the information is lost. What good is the watch if it can't accurately capture the training details?"
5,Garmin 305,Love it! I have been waiting a long time to buy this and it was so worth the wait. It gives me all the info I need and more to track my runs and gives me concrete proof that I am improving.
4,Perfect entry level GPS with Heart Monitor,"Purchased this to wear as I trained in the NYC area for my first marathon. About a month in, I could not be more pleased. I like to vary my training routes for a little variety in my outdoor runs, and this little baby tracks pace, distance, elevation, time, and, with the included heart monitor, it tracks your heart rate as well. More importantly, when you plug it into the computer, it will map out your routes according to GPS tracker, so that you can create and upload running routes to review them and even set up courses for your speed or interval training.THE ONE DRAWBACK: Sometimes the device is sluggish finding satellites, which means that you need to stand in a spot with a clear shot of the sky for about a minute while it locates them.Otherwise, I love it."
1,I've had two defective 305s and working on my third,Garmin apparently has big problems with the Garmin 305. I'm currently using my third unit. The first two went defective within 10 days of purchasing.Be prepared for problems if you purchase a 305
1,Battery failed after 11 months and cannot be replaced,Can't replace the battery and it failed after 11 months. Not covered under warranty. Will never buy another Garmin product.
4,Forerunner 305 GPS/HRM,"This adds HRM function that my current Forerunner 205 lacks. Better for training and combines functions into one unit that can be downloaded into the Training Center Software.Easy to maintain records of bike rides or other activities. Amazon pricing was very good, less than half of the list price."
4,Garmin 305,"This watch connects quicker to satelite than the old model, my old model quit working most likely from battery wearing out, hopefully this model will last longer"
5,Very satisfied,"I ordered this item in December 2008 and I'm very happy with it. Although it might look a little large in the photos, I did not find it bulky or uncomfortable. I'm still learning how to use all the features, but so far I have nothing but good things to say."
4,Bigger than a watch but functional,It is on the large size but not too big. Battery life seems to be excellent. It takes a minute to acquire the satellites but will acquire much quicker if you are not wearing it but rather leave it on a table or ground while it is trying to acquire the satellites.My chief complaint is I wish the heart rate readout on the device was larger. It is hard to read while running.
5,Great Watch! Highly Recomended!,"Wow! What a product! This is an amazing GPS watch for those of you out there looking for a a good running watch to give you accurate results while training.I had the Garmin Forerunner 301 and after accidentally dropping it and damaging it, I was looking for a new GPS watch. My 2 options were the 405 and the 305. After reading a lot about these, I chose the latter and I am very content. It is a very convenient watch, synchronizes quickly with the satellites and has option for the data display.Too bad it doesn't have a built in MP3 player..."
5,EXCELLENT BUY!!,I'm completely satisfied. My runs have improved w/this watch. I totally recommend it.
1,Disappointed in Reliability of Garmin 305,"The device is difficult to use for the average person and the manual does not give very good instructions. Also, I've had random problems. After taking a full charge, it shut down the next morning in the first 5 minutes of my workout. Then on my next workout, it showed the time and distance, etc... during the workout, but failed to record any of it to History, so the data couldn't be viewed later. I don't find the features described in the manual to be useful and trying to just use the basic feature of recording workouts seems to be hit or miss based on random problems. In trying to email customer support, I continually received notices that the system wasn't working and to try back later. I guess I'll try calling for support. I would not recommend this device."
3,Fell apart,The Forerunner 305 is a great training tool. My wife used her 305 to train for several marathons and triathlons. The main complaint that I have is that it simply fell apart on a run. The face and insides fell off and onto the street...killing it. Of course it was out of warrantee and Garmin would only offer to fix it for $99. That is not the quality I expect from Garmin.
4,Can't run without it,This is my second Garmin 305. I lost the first one and couldn't stand running without my Garmin. I thought about upgrading but I was so happy with the 305 that I didn't want to take the chance of not liking another. I don't go for a run without it.
4,Good choice,Heart rate monitor and GPS work very well. Workout programming is very useful. I guess the only drawback is that it can't really be used as a wristwatch - like some other models can.
3,Garmin 305 Review,"These things are okay for what they are. If you go in knowing that you can't change out the battery and have to buy a whole new watch when it ceases to take a charge, okay. The watch and its functions are fine. It is just that every year or so, invariably when you need it, the battery fails and you have to buy another. Oh, sure, you could pay $75 to $100 to send the watch in for repairs, but you can buy a new one for ball park $140, sooo.The problem I have had with this watch has nothing to do with the watch. It has to do with the so-called ""free"" shipping. I took three weeks to get my watch, and I only got then because for the last week or so I harassed Amazon every day. I got sick of the outright lies that they kept feeding me. Amazon really left a bad taste in my mouth over this order."
4,"Very good product, not perfect, but very good","A good product for outdoor use. GPS seems spot-on, calorie expenditure and elevation are approximately correct for this type of device. Overall, I would recomend it to my friends if they were wanting a GPS with heart monitor for general fitness use."
3,Very Very Good but...,It is very nice product (when it works properly) but sometimes it looses the satellite sign and does not turn back. For this instance I have to stop the training and to locate the satellites from the beginning (it takes almost 1 min). This problem is not so often but is really makes me mad. The garmin company says that it has the best sign receptor and does not lose the sign even if you pass near high buildings. There are not very high buildings in my area and I run along the sea nevertheless it looses the sign >:-(.PS I follow the instructions of the manual step by step and when I locate satellites before I start training I am completely unmoved .
5,Outstanding! Delivers on all promises,"Ok, my only regret with my purchase of the 305 is that I waited 2 months to purchase it because of the initial bad reviews. I had a 201 and loved it until I accidentally left it in my workout clothes and it got washed. It survived the washer but I think what did it in was banging around in the dryer. I trained/ran 2 marathons w/ the 201 and loved it. The 305 has been an awesome upgrade. I also bought the cadence for my bike and now I have all the info I could ever need. Having all this info has really re-energized my workouts and am now trying for my first Ironman. I have in two weeks put in 200 miles on the bike and 35 in running and have no complaints. It does acquire satellites faster, gets a stronger reception in tree cover, and connects with the computer far easier than the 201. My only issue is that I had to improvise my own bike mount but hope Garmin will be coming out with one soon. Also I wish it was waterproof enough to take swimming."
2,Great while it lasted,"I have used my Garmin Forerunner 305 for about a year and a half. It was always well taken care of. It was never dropped or submerged in water. I have used the Forerunner 305 to help train for several races including half-marathons, military physical training tests, dualathons... The Garmin was a great tool to help gauge my exertion level and speed. I really enjoyed being able to just hit the pavement and run without really planning out a distance route ahead of time. After running I could download my training session to the pc and track my progress.Then about a week ago during a race my watch just stopped. I can reboot it and it stays on as long as I don't put any pressure on the back of the watch. There seems to be a short somewhere under the back plate of the watch. Of course the warranty has now expired...which leaves me wondering what to buy now. I don't want to drop another $200 bucks on the same model and only have it last another year or so..."
4,If only you could actually see the HRM!,"Don't get me wrong. I love my Garmin 305 Forerunner, but I bought it instead of the 205 for the HRM. It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOO tiny that it's almost impossible to see, even standing still, let alone running."
1,What a crock,What an absolute crock of shit! I am AMAZED at the price..Here is more about the author [...] i WOULDN'T LINE HER POCKETS OR HER NARCISSISTIC EGO WITH A PENNY!|
2,Hawks in Flight,Disappointing. Many pictures are dark and/or fuzzy. I find that hard to distinguish features of different hawks.
2,butt hole,"I like these shorts as far as fit and style are concerned. Unfortunatley, after a half dozen washes, the seam in the butt split. Not what I expect in a fairly expensive sports garment."
2,Only if you really love the show,This DVD set is as basic as it gets and not really worth the price. The labels are plain white with the disk number on it. The episodes have not been enhanced in any way. There are no behind the scene features or cast bios. Basically you pay for a DVD copy of the show period.
3,Sound was bad.,"Terrible sound quality. Had to return it. Wish it was better.I would have liked to have kept it, brought back a lot of memories.Great show! No hassle return."
3,cello,I ordered the cello for my grandson to play in grade school. I was was pleased that it was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape.I was pleased at the looks of it.I was disappointed at the sound. We replaced some of the strings and it is better. For what I paid for it it should have had better strings.
3,Just Okay,"I bought the Legolas bow and arrow set to be part of my son's elven archer Halloween costume. The bow is a little over 40"" long and made of hollow plastic. The one we received was slightly bent in the middle when it arrived; nothing that couldn't be straightened, but it gives an indication of how sturdy this is (i.e. not very). The string isn't very taught -- not that you'd necessarily expect it to be for a costume prop. The arrows that come in this kit are... well, useless. Aside from the fact that they don't have fletching or a notch at the back, they're simply too short. You can't pull the string back more than a couple of inches. So, if you go with this prop bow, you'll probably want to DIY a few of your own prop arrows."
4,"Nice Pencils, Best Looking in My Opinion","I bought 4 packs of these pencils strictly on the basis of how they looked. I'm kind of strange in needing everything to match so these fit in well with my black pens and office supplies. That said they were a little more expensive than the typical yellow 12 packs at the store. But they are comfortable, sharpen nicely and the eraser works well. The pencil shaft is round but has a slight textured feeling (not a coating, but more of a flat paint) that helps to grip it."
2,"Not good, lead too brittle","A lot of people before me have said that it's a really good pencil but I find the lead to be too brittle! Don't waste your time getting these, unless you want to waste your time sharpening pencils."
5,Wow! These things are comfortable to write with,"I'm not going to go into detail about the lead or writing quality of these pencils -- they do the job fine for me. But I don't notice a huge difference with others, though I don't use pencils a lot. Just to write music. However, I'm sold on the comfort of these. The barrel is the right size, is round so no edges, and is very easy to write with. I'd strongly recommend these for those writing music, doing math problems, even some basic drafting. Also they'd be good for exams requiring a pencil."
4,"Not quite the same, but still amazing","I have been using the Mirado Black Warrior for about 14 years now, and they are by far the best pencil I have found. Recently I had to order some more packs because I had finally started to run low on my last bundle of them, and I have noticed that the pencil has changed a bit. They no longer have their nice shiny finish to them, nor do they have USA printed on the side. They look a little rougher than the original, but I have found that they still write incredibly smooth and still have really nice erasers. If you need a good pencil for anything I highly recommend these. I have used them for all types of school work, from math, science, and engineering classes to using them for low level art classes. I have used them while working with various kinds of woods and can see the lines great and can erase the marks if need be. They may not quite be the same, but they are still amazing."
1,Not what you remember,"These pencils, once a very fine brand, and now prett crappy. Poor workmanship, low quality wood, chipped finishes."
4,It's a Pencil for Goodness Sake!!!,"It's a pencil and it works like a pencil should. I'm astonished by all the fuss folks make over pencils. These were chosen to bump an order up to 25.00 so I could benefit from free shipping. As an artist who compulsively doodles and sketches I quickly run through pencils. Is there a difference? Yes. The Black Warrior and the Dixon Ticonderoga's that are subjects of much discussion and blog posts do write smoother that other 2B pencils, but neither enough for me to feel loyal to one or the other. They sharpen well or not depending on the sharpener used. If I have to choose a pencil to grieve over it would be the Staedtler Mars Lumograph 9B. So long little blue stump! It's been great to know you... :-)"
4,Sound background and concepts for CM,"If you are going to be working in the field of build and release management, then you will need a good background and working knowledge of Software Configuration Management. This book is the one that I believe will most readily enable you to achieve this. It doesn't look at specific techniques or tools, just what SCM is and why we need to do it."
5,Best book on CM,I am very much impressed about the importance and value of configuration management. This book boosted my company productivity by very high factors.
2,Dog collar 'ID heart Purse',"This ID heart purse is dangerous, in a matter of a few seconds after putting it on my pet, the lil ""heart charm"" fell off and was in my pups mouth ""Dangerous harzard to mouth and digestive in dogs""I do not recommend it! While it is cute, I am so glad I was nearby when it happened and was able to avoid an health hazard & expensive trip to the vets!!!"
4,Very nice. Especially good for beginners,"The 'Australian Women's Weekly' Magazine has produced quite a number of very decent cookery books. Two of these are,Chinese Cooking Class Cook BookandCooking Class Chinesewhich, despite the very similar titles are different in content. Both books are the same in terms of quality, however, and a common review will suffice. As with all the books I have seen by this publisher, the illustrations are top-notch and the recipes simple to understand and follow. In truth, the dishes on offer in both volumes are more the vaguely Chinese sort of items one would find in very westernized 'Asian' restaurants rather than in an actual Chinese kitchen but for anybody just looking to put together a nice Chinese type meal they could do a lot worse than these two books. I have an extensive library of Chinese cookery books and I have kept these books in my collection for some time."
3,Don't just buy a Sony,"Regarding the person who recommended the Sony for Ford vehicles. It's just not that easy. I've used the CDA-9 and an older CDA-7 in my Explorer, and after working fine for a few days, the Explorer rejected them both. Cassette adapters are a tricky business for some reason. Cheap or expensive, it really doesn't matter. Compatibility seems to be hit and miss, from vehicle-to-vehicle, not just from brand-to-brand.Sorry, I can't review this product, just wanted to correct the comment below regarding the Sony product and Ford vehicles. I'll give it a middle-of-the-road rating so I don't mess with the average."
3,For Collectors Only...,"This DVD is really nothing special; everything on it can be found cheap other places (it's all public domain).The one original feature is the 45-minute documentary 'Remembering Shemp'. It's interesting, but not very creative. It's composed almost entirely of three talking heads (Shemp's granddaughter, his daughter-in-law, and her sister), nothing too provocative. Since it's not well edited, they end up talking about their own lives as much as Shemp's, so don't be fooled by the running time.As a Shemp fan, I'd recommend this as a rental, tops, the only reason you might want to own it is to have all this stuff in one collecion."
2,Shemp deserves better,"What a disappointing DVD. The only saving grace was the bonus feature: Remembering Shemp, but even that got tedious with repeated footage continually going on throughout the feature. How many times do you have to see Shemp waving a hanky around? 6 or seven times? The quality of all the shorts are terrible, the worst being the Camel Comedy Caravan with what looks like a cat's coughed-up furball on the upper left-hand corner of the screen during the whole show. Though it was nice to see some of Shemp's early work, with the way the are wonderfully restoring the Three Stooges, you are better to wait until the volumes come out with Shemp in them before you waste your money on this DVD."
2,Disappointing Quality,"I so looked forward to receiving this 2-disc set. The exterior packaging seemed complementary to the sets of 3 Stooges DVDs being released chronologically by another company. BUT - and I rarely bother to write reviews here - I was greatly disappointed with the over-all quality of the films on this disc. Granted, the first two selections on disc 1 are rare, Radio Pictures shorts, and they're choppy and not restored. That I could forgive due the rarity of their availability, but the rest of the material was given no attention at all to clarity of picture- it was as bad in quality as they come. Since most of it is available elsewhere in better condition, I expected that Passport would have restored and refined the prints. Alas, not to be. So disappointing... buyer beware!"
4,Room For All Good Talent,"These Shemp shorts are great fun although not restored. Curly or Shemp is the usual debate. I love them both. Each brings a different spin to the Three Stooges but Shemp works, in his way, just as well. Both Curly and Shemp evoke laughs. Even Joe Besser had the chemistry, but came along too late. By his time, the series was a shadow of what it once was, so he was never shown to good advantage. Joe DeRita, in my opinion, just didn't have it in any way."
5,:),"my 2 1/2 year old is obsessed! This is worth the money, within the first week of getting it we got what we paid for!"
2,"""Modern Bow""","I bought this book to try and get some information on bows and bow hunting, since there really isn't much literature on it. I tend to remember things better if I read it then if someone just tells me. This is a good book, if you were reading it about 20 years ago. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend who was starting out. It's just dated, good as a reference for what things are called and stuff though."
4,Review,"This ethics book is great. I just took step 2 and I can say that it definitely helps. Let's be honest, most ethic questions should be easy. However, this book helps if you have a few that you're not sure. I honestly thought it was more helpful for COMLEX (DO board exam) step 2 than USMLE. Overall, I would recommend it if you think you are weak, but I don't think it is a must buy. I would love to see this book be updated with more ethical cases. Overall, good read, but not necessary to do well on Step 2."
4,Was specifically what I was looking for.,"I was looking for a way to organize my rod locker on my boat. since this model is under 9 inches long, it allowed me to install one set on each side of the locker and still have additional room down the middle where a lot of other models would have had to have been altered. So now I have storage for 6 rods locked in as well as left over space for more rods, paddle, etc. Happy with the product so far...the foam is a little stiff at first, you have to work the rod in there a few times for it to loosen up but should be a very nice addition in the long run."
2,For the serious and patient fan only,"For years I searched store shelves in vain looking for a quality book on Peter Gabriel. When I at last looked online, I thought I had found what I needed. However, this biography reads more like a textbook than a warm or interesting biography. The author spliced the book together using available quotes and interviews, and seems to never have talked to Peter himself. And while there are many interesting tidbits, such as the fact that a schoolboy Gabriel once made a hat worn by Keith Richards of the Stones on TV, it really drags. Even I, a serious fan, found myself skipping through many sections. Worth the read? Yes. If you think of yourself as a serious fan. An enjoyable read? Not really. In fact, you may be disappointed in your hero when you learn how distant he was from his wife and family."
3,more the man than the music,"A welcome update to his previous work, Bright's new book still has the same positive and negative sides of the first edition. Excellent research is his finest point (he talked to people who knew the subject well and did give great insights), but the stress on all matters personal and private seems to me a bit over the top. Sure we want to know what kind of a person Peter is besides his rock-star persona, but the text doesn't always succeed in connecting this with Gabriel's musical output."
4,A life that unfolds like a sunrise...,"This is definately the best biography about Peter Gabriel that exists. I was surprised at how intimate it was especially in a sexual way, but PG himself I believe advocates openness. So... He also appears to have endorsed this book about himself. I was glad also to come to the positive ending aswell. May happiness continue... A satisfying read all round and best piccies."
4,"Funny, sexy, lovely","A very good read, if you are involved in long train rides, plane rides..or just rides! Full of fun, sexiness and love. Erin Mccarthyy rocks! Don't miss her You Don't Know Jack."
4,Dr. McDreamy,"This was another good book by Erin McCarthy. I liked the idea that these were two doctors instead of most books where the man is rich and the woman is poor. I also liked that she makes Josie a little frumpy. I hate when the women in books are stick thin with no chest. I can't have a good fantasy going about these characters when the woman could be blown over by a gust of wind. How is that attractive? There were some laugh out loud moments, which I'm finding are the norm for this author's books.All in all, a good book. It was a bit heavy on the sexual innuendos(which I normally love), but at times got to be a bit much. I like to have a good balance of sexual tension and the characters actually getting to know one another, but this book seemed to teeter a bit more on the sexual side."
2,yuk,"... sorry, this one really was not worthy of McCarthy. I was on page 100 before the book got interesting. Before that it was all just page after page of sex. Pick up a porn novel. I trudged through it wondering if this was McCarthy's first try at writing (?) I was kind, though, and gave another chance with ""Heiress for Hire"". That is a winner through and through. Skip this one and read that book."
4,Great book!,I adore Erin McCarthy. This book was a light fun read about two orthopedic surgeons. The hero and heroine go through trials of the workplace and sexual tension. McCarthy does a great job adding humor into her novels. Although I didnt think this book was as good as smartmouth McCarthy still did a wonderful job.
4,Good Read.....Rated R for Racey!,"This is the first book I have read by this author.I enjoyed the story. It had humor, enjoyable characters and held my interest. There were a number of sex scenes in the book that were interesting to read. It didn't have a smutty feel to it though. I liked the book.Defintely will check out her other books."
3,Smart Mouth...gets the gold....,"This book was not as good as ""Smart Mouth"". At one point I just laid it aside and starting reading another book. I enjoy Ms. McCarthy's work and will continue to read it, but this book was not her best."
2,I like romance...,"but this didn't strike me as particularly romantic. I found the male lead to be overbearing, the female character a little whiny, and the conclusion made no sense to me (I'll try not to spoil anything, but she spends all this time agonizing over her chosen career, thinking it's not right for her, and solves this dilemma by... continuing on with the same job, that she now miraculously loves?).When I read a romance, though, the main thing I want is to be charmed by the characters. I was not charmed. In fact, the sheer amount of smut, starting on the very first page, was a real turn-off. I was embarrassed by the thought of someone else flipping through the book while I wasn't looking (and the bright pink cover attracted a LOT more attention than I thought it would). So, yes. Covert romance operations can try other venues. This one wasn't worth the subterfuge."
1,All and all a ho hum book,"If you are a computer enthusist and hate feeling like a book is insulting you this book is not for you. If you are a beginner, this book could be for you. Personally I prefer books that go more into detail, this one certainly does not, it follows in the foot steps of the ""linux unleased"" series in that it only provides the barest ammount of information to get the user by. I really feel like you money could be spent on another book a bit better on detail"
1,Please don't order this,This is not the book to buy if you don't like being frustrated. The book is poorly written and X-Term cannot be configured using the stated interface. It seems that required files are missing. The web page that is advertised no longer exists. Get Red Hat.
3,Only for Newbies !!,Good introduction to the linux and usefull to the first time users. But it has only limited explanation about main topics and a bad command reference. Not so good as i thought :/
5,The best linux book,"If you don't know nothing of Unix or Linux , then this book is for you ! . It teaches you with straight english and gives all the meanings and underlines all the important words. You will become a Linux expert with this book . The 4 CD's are exellent ."
5,"Good BIC quality, nice colors",I purchased this set of pencils so I'd have something to reach for when I wanted to do the daily crosswords. They are great for this - the colors are nice. I like the click feature which advances out more lead. Typical good BIC quality.
2,Missing Lead,"The mechanical pencils themselves are great. Have nice grip, light weight, but more than half of the pencils were either missing lead or had none at all. Kinda disappointed that some pencils weren't usable because they didn't have lead."
2,Came already opened and missing a pencil,"When it came, it had already been opened and was missing a pencil. Other than that, the pencils work fine."
5,Great Pencils,"This is the third year I have used these pencils. The first 2 years I liked them and then when they changed I liked them even more. I do not like the 0.5 but I love the 0.7.Good Luck Pencil shopingMaggie Blane(Hopkinsville,KY)"
1,Terrible Pencil,"I have never had so many problems with a mechanical pencil. My main complaint is that the lead seems to break every stroke the pencil takes. I find myself repeatedly pushing out more lead. Soon after, the lead pushes out all at once because it can't secure an inch of lead. The inch of remaining lead, instead, slides out of the pencil and is wasted. I normally get about four pushes for lead before the remaining lead falls out. I will never buy one of these pencils again."
3,"Great pencil, weak construction","My wife got me a pack of these mechanical pencils as a Christmas gift after observing how many times I ended up sharpening standard pencils. I instantly fell in love with them! They're very convenient and comfortable. They write just fine and the eraser works great.The only downside (which for me is significant, hence only earning this pencil three stars) is that the clips are made of a fairly weak plastic that tends to bend and break if carried around in the rings of a notebook or hung in the ""pencil slots"" in a backpack or briefcase. Every one of my pencils has suffered this loss and so now they just sit in the bottom of my bag/case, which of course means they get dirtier and are harder to find.If you just want to keep it on your desk and need an inexpensive and reliable pencil, this will work great for you. If you want to carry it around, however, you might want to check out something a little nicer with a metal clip."
5,Great inexpensive mechanical pencils,"I homeschool my 3 kids, ages 8-14, and these are our favorite mechanical pencils. They write well and are easily refillable but aren't so expensive that it's a worry when one gets lost. The 12-pack price is a terrific deal compared to prices in the stores."
5,Awesome!,I love these mechanical pencils from BIC! It reminds me of the ones they used to have that weren't metallic. I hope they keep making these forever!! The only kind of mechanical pencils I would use. It's a good size for me to grip and writes very well. The cushion for your fingers is great because I do need cushion for that pressure on the pencil on my fingers. I would recommend this pencil to everyone!
4,A Good Jazz Organ CD,"I have this new CD. Joey does the songs that made organist Jimmy Smith famous. Not all of my favorite tunes are on this CD, but enough of them to satisfy me. Also the organ sound is kind of too tone cabinet sound with extra reverb, rather than Leslie rotating speaker sound. It doesn't have that raunchy sound I'm used to hearing from Joey. I wish he had put his own sound to Jimmy Smiths songs. All in all, it's a great CD to add to your Joey Defrancesco collection."
1,More like assorted hand-me-down make-up,"What I ordered was not what I received. I got a bag full of miscellaneous leftover make-up...not the ""Kit"" I was expecting. I gave this product 1-star only because Amazon didn't let me give it 0-stars."
1,Crap!,"Crap! Wish I could give it no stars. All I received was old lipsticks and junk, was a waste of money!"
4,pencil sharpener,It works just like they said it would. It is easy to use by my three grandchildren ages 8 thru 5
4,ok,The pencil sharpner works really well. My only complaint is it sometimes only sharpens one side of the pencil leaving wood almost to the top of the lead on the other side.
5,Pencil sharpener review,For years we had a Panasonic KP150 pencil sharpener and loved it. Unfortunately it was dropped onto the floor and the shavings collector broke. This new KP150 is every bit as good.
1,Discontinued by Panasonic,"After sending in the KP380BK for repairs, I heard from Panacare - USA (Panasonic) that they no longer have, and will no longer be receiving replacement models for any (including the upright version) of their electronic sharpeners. They are now refunding the cost of the models to anyone who sends them a broken model within one year of purchasing it (receipt required). Thus, the Panasonic electric sharpeners are discontinued in the U.S. (which is why they are difficult to find)"
5,The best electric pencil sharpener,Panasonic electric pencil sharpeners are simply the best. I already had one and decided to buy a new one in my last visit to US. This time the vertical one.
5,Excellent pencil sharpener,"Worth every penny. Very glad we bought the upright model, allows one handed use and uses less desk space. No problem with shavings drawer size, plenty big for home use, would work for the office too."
1,Shrapens cockeyed,"I am very disappointed in this pencil sharpener. It is the worst I have ever triedfor sharpening crooked, i.e., there is an excess of exposed lead on one side andwood all the way down to the point on the other side. Even the cheapest hand crankedsharpeners are no worse about this. Trying to guess which way to tilt the pencil toget it straight is the only way to get workable results at all, but is very difficultto pull off and takes many tries. I will not buy a pencil sharpener again withouttrying it out.Aside from that, I do like the vertical design, and the shavings box is bigger thanthe last electric I had."
1,Sharpener doesn't work.,"I ordered this sharpener as a Christmas gift based on the good reviews. The one we received didn't work at all, right out of the box. It just makes a humming noise when the pencil is inserted. Fortunately Amazon makes returns easy, but there is still inconvenience involved, and we still don't have a pencil sharpener."
4,Does the job well,"Not much to say other than it does the job and is well made. Stick in dull pencil, wait several seconds and out comes sharp pencil. Mission accomplished. So far my kids have not jammed it. Like the vertical design but make sure you have clearance for where you intend to place the sharpener."
1,I really wanted to like this sharpener.,"I had the same experience as Patricia D. Brown had: After having worked wonderfully, the sharpener produced dull and extremely fragile tips. Instead of producing a conical tip, the sharpener produces a cylindrical one, where the point is blunt and too much of the graphite is exposed.My sharpener became poor after three months, instead of Brown's nine months, probably because it was used for four hours twice a week.I really wanted to like this sharpener, despite its noise and its tiny pencil shavings holder. The vertical entry, sleek appearance, and Panasonic brand were enough for me to convince myself to spend over $100 for a sharpener. But it's junk."
4,Shocked at price change!!,"While I would give this a 5 star for overall product quality, I am shocked at the price hike!! I just came on to order a 2nd one for my classroom, since I loved mine so much that I bought a year and a half ago. However, I paid $35 for mine!! I have NO idea how they justify this being worth $140?!? It would have to be able to the job entirely by itself for that price. ;) I guess I will be looking for a different sharpener for now... Too bad~"
4,Had one for years and it's worked fine.,"Now, I don't use the thing every day and empty the container right after every use -- but this Panasonic has been great to me. Gives a perfect point every time. The only reason I'm taking off one star is because I really need one that can accommodate different widths."
5,"Great writing, plotting and characterizations!","In fact, what we've come to expect from Colin Dexter. His Morse series is a reader's dream! Dexter pens a great story, and the mysteries in these stories are also very good - complex and difficult to solve. As much as I enjoyed the televesion programs, reading the books has been a delight! Morse is just as brilliant as John Thaw portrayed him, but he is something more. He's much more vulnerable, mercurial, quixotic and yes, more eccentric. He drinks more and lives larger than he appears on TV, and these have an effect on his health. In this book, we see a vulnerable Morse battling his mortality while he tries to solve a complex case. He wins the battle this time, but we know that the next book will be his last and that makes reading this book a bitter-sweet experience. Read this series! It should not be missed!"
2,He Can Do Better,"This song is booorrring. I thought it was okay the first time I played, then I found I quickly got tired of it."
1,not adequate price,Very cheap look for this price.You can buy the same quality in a Dollar Store and save 60 bucks.
4,big performance,"This speaker is ultra-compact, but it sure does offer big performance. I used the keyhole slots on the back to mount them in my family room wall, and you'd never even realize they were there. Friends and family are blown away by the performance."
1,Worst Video Ever,This video was absolutely awful. I expected performances and all I got was the same music on everything and no Elvis singing. What a disappointment!! This return policy said to return it it had to be unopened. I threw it away.
3,Similar Themes,"Shirley Lim's book, Among the White Moon Faces, takes the reader through her life, starting from when she was a young girl in Malaysia, through all of her schooling, and through her move to the United States. Throughout the book she describes her thoughts and her feelings on her various hardships, and really tries to communicate with the reader.Personally, I felt very ambivalent about the book. I didn't particularly like, nor dislike it. The writing is advanced, and complex, so it's really not for younger readers. If you've read a lot of other works by Asian American writers, you'll notice a lot of similar themes. I didn't feel as if Shirley Lim said anything new, or different with this book. Also, I felt like the second half of the book went very slowly. However, if you enjoy a lot of descriptive writing, or autobiographies, you'll like this book."
3,Dividing into 2,"I see this book has two completely different division. First, her Malaysian life, second her life in America. Although her narration has been splendid and the description of the calamities of Malaysia was indeed too true, the lifestyle, the play and all her chapters are expressing the life of the people however, the memoirs jumps from parts to parts and did not chain up as a story. Well, it might be a new way of writing but I assure a lot wouldn't appreciate this style as much as me...for a Malaysian born writer, she's not bad."
3,"Great pic's, less info on geological history as was looking for.","This book was okay. I bought it to read in preparation of a three day hike in the Grand Staircase Escalante. The book has sections where it talks about the geology, people of the land, biology, etc. The language is a bit over my head and didn't catch my attention. To give you an idea of my education and intellectual ability, I have a masters in counseling and have taken several geology classes on an undergraduate level. So, the book just didn't cover as much about the formations of the land or the geology. However, if you are looking for a book on the area there really are not that many options (at least I didn't find them)."
2,a little dated for 2012,"Well I have not gotten past chapter 1 but though the book is published in Feb 2002, it was not written in it. It discusses the 1992 election that ushered in the Wilston and Shea administration. This sort of keeps the story from drawing me in."
1,NATAS REFICUL? Give me a break. Less than one star,"This author apparently thinks people are either too stupid to read ""Lucifer Satan,"" or applaud his apparent cleverness in disguising the bad guy. Fundie Christian fear-mongering. People who buy into this junk should also buy into Left Behind--that great science series where millions of people are raptured, but you can still eat in a five-star restaurant and hop a plane anytime."
4,Dated but still useful,"This work includes only the major authors in Canadian Literature, as well as a few other notables who contributed a significant volume or two to our national literature. The book was revised and reissued in 1978, the new edition consisting of 145 pages. A useful reference for those who happen to need some bibliographical info on a major Canadian author, but it is of course a quarter century old."
4,Seriously Complex Piano Music Played with Conviction,"When I first played this CD I thought that I had made a mistake in ordering it. There were no memorable themes or catchy beats to leave one in a state of anticipation for a subsequent hearing. Yes, the music is ""impressionistic"" so it paints impressions of emotions. These emotions often tumble forward like large ocean waves crashing upon rocks in the dead of night. Yet the playing is exquisitely fluid and sympathetic. As if the performer truly understands the emotional mysteries contained therein. He makes the music his own. It is that authenticity which keeps me coming back to this recording, that and the wonderfully recorded sound. It may deserve 5 stars as my appreciation of it grows over time."
1,"AGAIN, NOT A DISCWORLD FILM",Please understand that a company that calls itself BRAIN DAMAGE FILMS has nothing to do with either DISCWORLD or the writer named Terry Pratchett. I am certain this release will suck moose.
1,holster for v188,"My original one was delivered cracked, but within 3 days I received a free replacement, and Amazon didn't charge me for the shipping of the new one or the shipping to return it! This item is made of very thin plastic, so I don't know how long it will last. My husband has the same one, and his is fine. Once again, Amazon has been great and I am satisfied!!!"
2,Too much for this listener,"Apparently a lot of people are really into this disc. That is great.There was a lot of hype surrounding this disc, so I picked it up. Don't get me wrong, these guys have chops pouring out of every orifice, but I can't remember a lyrically good song on the disc, or even a chorus for that matter. This disc would have been somewhat interesting with no vocals, but the vocals just throw a wrench into everything.If you are into REALLY technical metal, I assume you will go to bed with this disc under your pillow. If you are more of a progressive metal fan, like me, pick up Kamelot's new album, it has the cheese factor, but it is very decent."
3,"Good, but not my style","This is interesting music, but not everybody's style. It certainly isn't among my favorites. Sceptic's Universe has a few traits I usually associate with '80's prog metal: it's heavy and the singer reminds me of Operation: Mindcrime era Queensryche. In actuality, this album is mush heavier than Mindcrime and the like. It is filled with complex rhythm and playing. There's no mistaking the fact that these guys are great musicians and capable of composing complex parts, but too often they seem to fight with the vocals for the direction of the song. I can see Spiral Architect becoming a great prog-metal band, but they still have some work to do."
5,One of the best discs ever,"I have listened to this disc since the day it was released, and all I can say is ""wow"". Technical, crazy, complex, brilliant is some of the words that best describes this record. A must buy for most prog-lovers, especially those who are really into technical stuff (even though this goes beyond just ""technical"".IMHO, the best songs are ""Insect"" and ""Fountainhead"".Peace."
3,"Instruments=yes, singing=no.","I just stumbled upon this alpha and omega Album, and just gave it an entire listen through. I love progressive rock/metal and can appreciate the instrumental achievement found here, but I just cant get into his singing. As somebody else put it in a review, the whole album couldhave been an instrumental but he just sang over it all. His tone isnt even on target most of the time, but in his defense this music is hard to sing to as it is so sparatic in its sound. I can endure and even enjoy high/screeching vocals if its done right, but these just stink in my opinion. Some examples of bands similar that I actually love are Darkwater,Suspyre,Cirus Maximus,Cloudscape,Zero hour, and quite frankly the best of all Devin Townsend and his extreme Strapping Young Lad. If your a bass junky/player you will enjoy. If you can ignore his vocals, which is hard to do, you can get alot more out of it. Worth recommending though."
3,too much,"Heh, my thoughts seem to have been anticipated by prior reviewers. This CD overwhelmed me a little. It's just too technical, to the point that it possibly violates the definition of music. The bottom line is that those of you who are into ultra-technical bands like Watchtower, Sieges Even, Spastic Ink, and Power of Omens will like this, while those of us who are into Dream Theater, Stratovarius, and Nevermore would rather pass."
1,what a mess,"As a big fan of progressive rock and metal, I was highly disappointed with this cd. It seems like this band try way too hard to be way over the top with songs going a million directions at once. After listening to the cd many times, there's still not a single song that I can remember. I can never go back and hum a chorus or vocal melody. This almost sounds like a bad jazz band on angel dust. If this bad toned it down a little for their next cd, I feel they will be potential of making a decent cd. The singer has a decent voice, he just needs to learn how to use it.There's nothing memorable about this cd no matter how many times you listen to it. Try Dream Theater or Spock's Beard or Shadow Gallery instead."
2,a little over-done,"I am a huge fan of progressive rock and progressive metal, but I think they went a little overboard with this cd. I admit it probably takes tons of practice for these guys to do what they're doing here and to get everything just perfect, but most of the time it doesn't really sound like they're playing anything in particular. The singer is great, but he'd be better off in another band. I don't know, it just sounds like a big mess to me."
2,This is what's wrong with prog-Metal...,"Spiral Architect, is yet another band who opt to exhibit their virtuosity, instead of writing good songs. Are they impressive? Yes. Is Nordberg a bass God? Sure. Is there anything on this CD that is worth hearing a second time? Probably not.I'd be interested to hear what these guys are up to in a couple of years. Maybe with age will come wisdom, and with wisdom, the maturity not to ruin their songs showing off their chops.If you are looking for some great Prog-Metal, check out either of Ark's two CDs."
1,Bleah!!,"Don't waste your money buying this cd. When I hear ""music"" like this I understand why Kazaa is so famous...the vocalist sounds like my sister singing in the shower (I even think she sings better...) and the bassist goes by himself all the time. I prefer Zero Hour or Treshold a million times. This is not music, this is a mix between a bad jazz and a worst progressive metal gig."
4,"Great Album, Great Band.","For all people who enjoy technical progressive metal combined with jazz fusion influences this album is great. Spiral Architect reminds me of Watchtower but they managed to add their own unique touch here, innovation, and countless amounts of instrumental technical skills that only the open minded listener would understand and enjoy to the max."
4,A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words,"The story of Max Factor as he rose from Russian immigrant to Hollywood royalty-the man who brought glamour to the stars and regular folks alike with the invention of pancake makeup, no fade lipstick and the idea that makeup should fit a woman's coloring. (He had rooms in his store for blondes, brownettes, brunettes and redheads-all color coded and enhanced to work with the skin tones of the women in each category!) The star of this book is definitely the photographs, however. Make-up test shots, his early years in Russia, wig making contraptions, print ads of the stars endorsing his products-the pictures tell a better story than the text!"
3,OKAY,"It could have had better tracks on it. I expected more because the other Oldies But Goodies CDs volumes have been pretty enjoyable. My mom and I do like some of the songs on here, so i guess it's not all bad. Also YET AGAIN there seems to be something wrong with Amazon's track listing. ;("
4,Pretty Good,"I am 30 years old and have acne as well as rosacea. I have tried everything over the counter for both problems, and most recently the very expensive laser surgery. That laser surgery (Isolaz) did NOT work. Save your money. It cost me $700 for three treatments and my acne and rosacea were both worse. I tried this product, even though it is very expensive. I have been using it for 2 1/2 months, and my acne has improved greatly. My rosacea is lighter and there are less ""bumps"" in my rosacea. My skin is not perfect by any means, but it is definitely 70% better than what is has been for the previous 10 years.Also, it is a great moisturizer. This is good, because I used to use Clinique's Moisture Surge which is like $40 itself. So, it sort of kills two birds with one stone. I like it!"
3,Made my redness worse,"This product did not work for me - it hydrates well and helped with dry skin, but made the redness on my face worse."
5,Very good moisturizer,My wife has some very dry skin on her nose. This product has taken off the dry patch. She still has a red tint but is not as noticeable. I bought some tinted zinc oxide that works to protect her against the sun. These two product together work well for her. She uses this product on her lips also. This is my first Amazon review. Don't hesitate about the price.
3,Good but expensive and there is a cheaper alternative.,"DERMAdoctor Calm, Cool & Corrected 2N1 Rosacea Tx is very good for red inflammed skin, acne and it keeps your skin extremely hydrated without causing the breakouts but it is extremely expensive for not a very big jar. And if your like most Rosacea sufferers then you don't just have your face to deal with and so you use much more than just a small amount for your face daily. I have found that Noredol is slightly cheaper and it is gel based so it goes a lot further and appears to be working just as well but not quite as moisturizing. But you can use moisturizer for sensitive skin in addition and the Noredol keeps you from breaking out even though you are moisturizing."
5,Saved my Skin!!,"Last summer my skin suffered a MAJOR Rosacea outbreak thanks to an adverse reaction to some topical medication I was put on. Nothing my dermatologist gave me helped. Then, in an act of desparation, I plopped down 85 bucks for this cream, and thank goodness I did; it brought my skin completely back to normal; in just a couple months my skin was radiant and clear! I am now back to using my normal oil free moisturizer, but if I ever suffer another outbreak, I know where to turn: Calm, Cool & Corrected!"
2,Didn't work for me...,"I gave it a shot for a while until the small bottle was completely empty, and it just didn't seem to make a difference for me. The cream feels cool on the skin, which is nice, but overall I didn't notice a change."
5,"Nice fit, great vendor!","The liner was just as described, and I really appreciated the vendor's email confirming the model of my truck before shipping it."
2,disapointed with content,"This CD was surposed to be about the year 1932.There were weird clips about events that were not introduced well and not at all informative.There was more raw info about the year on the back cover but content was terrible.Nothing about what things cost back then, sports info, state of the U.S., or the world.It was a waste of money."
3,Ex-Salvationist,"Not myself, but Ironside used to be a Salvation Army pastor once. That's what intrigued me to this book. I have not read it yet. That's why i'm giving it 3 stars for now. Hopefullyi remember to come back to this review and revise my opinion."
2,"Puerile, juvenile and banal","I expected this to be a good read as it seems so popular in the SF world, but it's really bad. The plot is cliched, as are the characters. There are a few genuinely interesting ideas here, but they're lost in the utter banality of the rest of the story and the terrible writing.I abandoned this book about halfway through because I just couldn't take it any more. There was no nuance, no depth and the characters, and I mean ALL the characters, are like the cast of a cheap, badly-written sitcom. It's like a constant string of dad jokes, wisecracks and cheap gags that simply are not funny. It got to the point that reading this started to feel like watching your old dad dance at a party and I'd had enough.A real shame, but I simply do not understand all the love for this book."
4,Interesting Concept,Well written exploration of an interesting concept. The idea of space exploration using experienced humans opens up entirely new approaches to storytelling. Will look forward to reading more of these stories.
4,Interesting concept,"The writer delivers a very interesting alternative to our current world. The concept of older people being useful and extending life beyond the typical amount of years we get is cleverly developed. Overall, I found this more enjoyable than many other works of science fiction."
3,Old Man's War,An interesting premise. At first read I was ready to put the book aside but as I perservered it got better and better. I will follow up the series.
3,"A Well Crafted Yarn, but Far from a Classic","While enjoyable and well crafted, this novel lacks subtlety and will not leave any lasting literary impact. Old Man's War is a another chapter in the long history of pulp fiction that has long been a mainstay of the science fiction genre, it has a visceral appeal with action, space-battles, and techno-magic, but does not have a compelling plot or characters, nor does it feature any particularly original thoughts.If you are looking for an easy reading, entertaining space opera-like novel, then I recommend this book. I would ignore the comparisons to Starship Troopers, for while this book has similar features, it lacks the superior prose and originality of Heinlein's much earlier seminal work, and you would (like I was) only be disappointed. Take this book for what is, and you will enjoy it, expect more from it, and you will be disappointed by it."
4,Some great ideas well realized,"I really liked this book, though I wouldn't put it into the first rank of SciFi literature. Scalzi has some great ideas and does a really clever job of sort of ""futurizing"" a lot of current tech developments to some of their logical conclusions. I think the universe he creates is well realized and seems believable and I can't wait to read the sequels."
3,"A Light, Enjoyable Read","Reading ""Old Man's War"" is a lot like having dinner with a friend you know too well--there are few surprises and some of the jokes are old, but in the end you enjoy the meal.The narrator/protagonist is an engaging old coot and is at times pretty funny. The supporting cast serves up a few yucks as well, though it is hard to tell them apart. They blur together without any real distinction, other than the ""gay"" or ""physicist"" tag.At times the writing is too talky and some of the bits go on too long, so feel free to skim ahead--you won't miss anything. The science is fairly pedestrian and somewhat dated, and the alien battles are more amusing than gripping.Scalzi is not the next big thing. I just wish the critics weren't hyping him to be more than he is. If you approach this book without a lot of overblown expectations, you will find this novel a fun escape."
4,Almost a Five star,"A good read, a little bit to much comes from RH, but if you like him it is not hard to get past that. Well worth your money if you like good SF that is not just a re make of history with ray guns. I just love the way he sets up the deal for a new body."
2,Confirmation Bias,"Recently, Old Man's War topped a readers' poll of the Best Science Fiction of the decade at Tor.com. Peter Watts' Blindsight was #4. Blindsight is by (very, very) far the better book (2 & 3 were fantasy). This tale is a decent yarn, but it's ideas are mostly rehashed and so thinly explained that many of its arguments about how we'll interact (hint: very violently and genocidally, though all narrated with a human-touch) with alien civilizations, much less the aliens themselves, are only plausible if you're looking to have your biases confirmed.If you want bleak-but-scientifically-and-plausibly-defended, go read Watts (you can even get his whole Rifters trilogy free). Or, if you're looking for a poignant tale of aging and war, go read Iain M. Banks' Look to Windward (which is also an excellent book). And, if you want great recent space opera, go grab John Charles Wright's Golden Age trilogy. If you want some confirmation bias, I suppose that this'll do."
5,Not as good as Heinlein - better!,"While the steady stream of interesting and entertaining ideas in this book is reminiscent of Heinlein, the quality of the writing surpasses all but the very best of Heinlein's novels. On the strength of this book alone, I'm adding Scalzi to my list of must-buy authors. The setting, the plot and the character development are all first-class. Highly recommended."
1,"bad science, shallow writing","""Old Man's War"" is a trite, weakly written novel that barely qualifies as science fiction. The characters are aging people from earth who are transformed into hyper-soldiers to fight aliens. The science (I'm a hard core devote) is absent or implausible, and the action is a series of chiches. For example, at boot camp the sargent delivers a brutal speech about the horrors of war, ho-hum."
1,Ridiculously overrated,Since most people just want to have quick idea about what they should expect from the product I'll keep this very short and to the point.If what you are looking for is just another action packed book which lacks both imagination and intelligence this one may serve you well.On the other hand if you are looking for a real sci-fi book I highly recommend you to stay away from Old Man's War as well as any other book written by this author.
1,"All talks, not enough actions.","If you expect an action filled novel like the Ender series written by Scott Orson Card, you will be greatly disappointed. I bought this book based on all the rave reviews I read here and I felt like a sucker. I could not finish reading this book because it bored me to tears. There are dialogs after dialogs, but no action. If this is a movie, there will be only one scene in the whole movie, of people talking to each others.So be warned!!!"
3,Inventive,"This is a solid debut novel with an interesting premise and plenty of action, but the writing leaves something to be desired at times, especially the overly witty dialogue."
4,Fun read,"Takes the ""Forever War"" and stands it on it's head. I enjoyed it as a guy who's entering my middle age. The writing was okay and the premise was interesting. I'll definitely read the next ones on the series."
2,Leans towards star wars,"Old Man's War leans dangerously close to Star Wars, in my opinion. Like Heinlein in Star Ship Troopers, Scalzi inexplicably feels the need to have humans fighting face to face with aliens. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENCE. For example, why not use drones? Why not use NUCLEAR WEAPONS? Are they really afraid of radiation - they can't deal with cancer? Blach! The idea that humans would go land on a planet with rifles, line up, and shoot at the aliens like the soldiers in Napoleon's arms is weapon grade balonium. The attempt to add hand to hand combat + sci fi is too contrived. 4/5 for a fantasy novel, but 2/5 for science fiction.If you want good sci fi, read books descended from Asimov, not Heinlein."
3,What to do,"Sadly i could not sympathise whit the novel and gave up after 19 pages, but seeing he won some good award, i maybe give it an other go.a day later i must say the book is getting better fast."
4,good fast-reading adventure,This book reads fast and is a lot of fun. Not a lot of tech. depth (thank god) just old fashioned sci fi fun. Reminds you of old school sci fi adventure.
3,Old Man's War,"I picked this book up at my library because the first line really caught my attention. The whole book was well written and seemed like it could really happen. (at least, if we could travel through space!)This would have been a four star book,(not five stars because it's not a book that I would read over and over.) I gave it a three, however because it was crude with quite a lot of bad language. Most of it went with the story, but I still found it disturbing.I would have pursued the sequal, but didn't because I didn't want to be exposed to more sex and bad language."
2,Not worth the time.,"The first few chapters showed some real promise, but quickly this book fell flat. Predictable, annoying, jarring dialogue coming from flat, boring characters is what you should expect. The main character is untouchable and emotionless. Too much time is spent explaining their emotions and motivations, not enough time is spent letting the characters behave within their world. The world is well constructed, but the characters don't live in it, as much stand in front of it. It gets worse in each chapter, by the end, we're basically just combining names of places with lists of characters that die there. There's no emotion, there's no drama, and definitely nothing important or interesting. At least its a fast read."
5,Every time.,I cry every time I read this book. Scalzi can reach into your soul and touch part of it you didn't know raised.
5,A great book,I had been hoping to discover a new (for me) author. Most of the ones where I could read anything they wrote and be sure I'd like it were no longer with us. This and red shirts lead me to happily feel I can settle in with lots of books to lose myself in. Sci if with just enough tech to make it feel sci fi but nothing that lost me or made me confused. And touches of humor to break up the battles. Week written and a definitely compelling story. You will feel connected to the characters and care about them!
4,Great classic-style science fiction with that human touch,"I loved this book. I read the whole thing over the course of a rather busy day, but it's an easy read, so it fit nicely into spare time. Most of the characters aren't deeply developed, but the reason becomes apparent through the story.The book also leaves some interesting plot lines open for future development and the characters that are developed are the kind you won't to have succeed in their journeys.I'll definitely be reading the later volumes of the series."
2,"Starts strong, but disappoints soon after ...","Bought the book based on the excellent reviews. Book starts really well - entertaining, sometimes funny and interesting, new idea (seniors enlisting to army). But excitement soon disappeared - book soon turns into boring ""starship troopers"" killing all kinds of ""evil, nasty"" aliens and plot just gets week ... towards the end I felt like the whole book should have condensed to 30-40 pages and let's go ... what's next? Well, that is maybe answered in other Scalzi's books, but I won't know ..."
3,Reasonable first offering,"Not a long book by today's standards, Old Man's War starts off well, with interesting ideas, humour, and fairly interesting characters. But, the book ends on a down note, with the last third of the book being plagued by too many coincidences involving the main character(at least 2 or 3 too many), none of the humour found in the beginning of the book, and a series of generally mundane battle sequences.I give it 3 1/2 stars, rounded down to 3 stars.I suppose if dressed up right, this story could evolve into a TV or movie screenplay."
3,Fun little book,"Just got done reading it and I found it an interesting and fun read. Nothing major or mind blowing, just fun. I agree with some of the reviews that the supporting characters, with one exception (Jane) were pretty dull, boring and interchangable. When I would read how one of his friends died I couldn't help but wonder who that person was exactly and why I should care.The battle scenese were nicely written and I do love me a good battle scene. The ending seemed a bit rushed with a final chapter was was more ""okay, here's what happened now, then this, then this"" but, up to that point I was entertained.The Arwen"
4,Interesting. Hard to put down.,"I didn't sleep much while reading this. The author has a good understanding of human nature, and the story explores some interesting questions."
4,Great trilogy,"Book one of a great trilogy. Book two is Ghost Brigades, concluding with Lost Colony. Don't waste your time with ""book 4"" Zoe's Tale. The action, humor, characters, and twists make this trilogy a great read."
4,"Fun, but. . . .","A fun read, but I liked Jack Campbell's Dauntless series quite a bit more. I disagree, in particular, with the lead review that praises the tone of the book. I found the tone uneven and often discordant. I also found the premise unpersuasive -- that a technologically advanced space army needs the ""consciousness"" of elderly people to fill out its ranks. But the book was worth it, if only for an excellent joke about the Chicago Cubs."
4,Compelling main character,"I was a bit skeptical about this book, but it turned out to be a fun vacation read. Scalzi managed to win me over despite the fact that military sci-fi is not my favorite sub-genre. The basic premise of *old* people going to war was great. The main character had real depth and his development is what kept me hooked. Some of the secondary characters and the overall cultural milieu were less compelling. Some other characters felt a bit shallow. Perhaps this is because, as you might expect in a war story, many characters don't last very long. The setting felt a bit contrived at times, as if it were only serving to provide character development for the protagonist. (And that development, as I said, was good... I'm just not sure I fully believe in the military/political structure of the Colonial Defense Force.) The romantic sub-plot was solid and surprising and is what ultimately makes me want to read the sequel."
3,"Entertaining, not mind-blowing.","I thought that overall book was a fairly entertaining read that kept me busy for a few days: a solid 3.5-star book. The reason I hedged toward 3 instead of 4 was because I felt the ending was a little weak, and the premise was highly implausible (even within the book's fictional boundaries created by the author).Pick it up if you're a SciFi buff looking for a quick, fun, light read, but don't be expecting anything really deep or complicated."
4,A decent read,"If you enjoy Heinlein, you'll enjoy this.If you worship Heinlein and denegrate anything that reminds you of him, you'll not like this.It's not great, but it's certainly a very good and worthwhile reading."
5,Wow now I can look forward to retirement!,A great space opera in the fashion of Heinlien. Story moves quickly and leaves you begging for the next book.
4,Rejuvination - at a cost,"A unique take on the immortality-through-cloning plot - to get your 'rebirth' you have to sign up for the intergalactic armed forces. Though the story took a while to get going, seemingly because the author took too much time (or pleasure) in explaining how the immortality was going to work in his universe, once you get past the army cliches, the story becomes quite fun. I like the alien races he created, and how he imagined our interactions with them to be. The story really got GOOD in the last third of the book, so I expect the follow-on books to be just as good now that the universe is already explained."
5,great read,"A lot better than many movies put together. A fine blend of fresh thinking, fast action and interesting humor. Very enjoyable to the last page. Can't wait for more from this author."
5,"I've Grown Tired of the Claims, But . . .","I have seen too darn many authors hyped as the new Heinlein, but had OLD MAN'S WAR been labeled as a newly-discovered 'lost' novel by Heinlein, I would have believed it. It is not only that good, but also that full of the flavor of Heinlein's writing. I have put the sequels to OLD MAN'S WAR and others by Scalzi on my wish list, and most definitely look forward to reading them.What more is there to say?watziznaym@gmail.com"
3,What's All the Excitement About?,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed ""Old Man's War"". But I enjoyed it more when it was called ""Starship Troopers"" or ""The Forever War"". Scalzi's book is well written and has a few fun ideas like the BrainPal and SmartBlood and the Ghost Brigades, but in the end it is very derivative of the above mentioned sources (as well as the movie version ofStarship Troopers). John Perry is an interesting character, but the reality is that he doesn't really change much through the course of the book, and in the end he doesn't seem that moved one way or another by the prospect of losing his resurrected wife from his former life. The novel is good on plot, well-paced and solidly written. It suffers from soft characterizations and a lack of originality. If you're going to give us this type of book, give us characters we care about or don't bother."
1,Not for Discerning Readers,"Judging from the cumulative score, a lot of people like this book. Good for them. But it has some of the worst dialog I have ever encountered. A typical example:""Sorry about that,"" Thomas said. ""I didn't mean to hold everyone up. The fettuccine was excellent, but my lower intestine would apparently beg to differ.""""Please feel free not to share such information in the future, Thomas,"" Susan said. ""We don't know you that well yet.""""Well how else will you /get/ to know me that well?"" Thomas said.Endless pages of this stuff. If it sounds funny to you, buy the book. Otherwise, save your money."
4,I couldn't put it down,"First the bad. I found the first few chapters somewhat annoying. The author goes a bit too far with his bunch of wise-cracking, smart-mouthed Americans in space. It feels like he was trying to be a bit too smart with his characters, who seem to have dialogue modelled straight out of a mindless Hollywood action movie. Get past that though and the story really takes off. I literally couldn't put it down and as a consequence had to struggle through work the next day in a lethargic haze. The story is exciting and moves quickly. Its not as original or as well-written as Haldeman's Forever War, but who cares, this is a fun novel that really draws you in. An excellent first novel."
1,"Interesting story, but way too much vulgar language for me.","While I enjoyed the premise and execution of the book, the level of vulgar language was way too high for my personal tolerances. Your mileage may vary, but if four-letter words aren't your thing, I'd recommend staying away."
2,Empty Sci-fi Miliporn,"That's it. It's miliporn. The concept was great, but in the end the author was not up to developing it. Actually its low grade miliporn because it's pretty obvious this guy is a Deitz-wannabe but hasn't the chops to pull it off. The Deitz cyborg legion covers the same issues from the same empty right wing positon but does a much better job. Or read, Their Master's War; The enternity Brigade; The Forever War; Bill, The Galactic Hero, I could go on but why point out so many books that do a better job on the theme?The real tragedy, of course is that the author has a great idea. If I was an editor and been given a choice sight unseen between this work and the Clone Republic I would pick this book immediately. The problem is that the clone Republic is a higher grade of miliporn than this piece. That's too bad because if he could open up his view and write for the sake of his work and not a check, this author could be a fantastic writer."
2,2.5 stars on the Amazon scale...,"...I've seen it written in a few places that Scalzi follows in the Heinlein tradition of scifi. The Heinlein that gave us Stranger in a Strange Land. The Heinlein that gave us The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. And the Heinlein that gave us Starship Troopers. In full disclosure mode, I admit that I'm not terribly familiar with Heinlein's work. I read a novel or two of his in high school before largely moving on to Gibson, Vonnegut, and other novelists that better resonated with me. A lesson there? Perhaps not...."
1,Trite,"I bought this book with the expectation of something new in the way of military science fiction. Ultimately the book proved to lack much in the way of character development and originality. The main character easily jumps past moral quandaries with a pause and a sigh. Perhaps it is an unfair comparison, but the Forever War deals with alienation in a much more effective way.Ultimately, it reads like John Wayne of the future with the main character saving the day in multiple, and very tired ways. All of the ""surprises"" were predictable and uninspiring and the hints of self-doubt are pushed aside like so many alien carcasses.I highly recommend avoiding this book."
4,An Excellent Trilogy,"I picked up Old Man's War because of the title and the great reviews on Amazon. I picked up the 2 remaining novels in the trilogy because the first book is solid science fiction. It was highly readable, the characters had depth and the alternate reality so important to sci-fi was consistent and believable. It was an enjoyable read.I think the price is too high. Yah, yah, I know all about Amazon pricing policies and publishers. $24 bucks for the trilogy is too expensive for a data stream. I read a lot and this will push me back to the local library. I'm on a fixed income and I can't afford $100 a month for 12 novels.Other than pricing, I'd buy more of what John has written. As it stands, I'm going to be walking to the library tomorrow."
4,A fun read,"The book is an easy read and is quite funny. Although it has some interesting sci fi ideas and human relationships, it does not explore these in any great detail. Just good fiun."
3,"interesting ideas, not that well written","I tried to like this book. The premise is interesting and held my interest for a while. I wanted to see where it was going. But the writing constantly reminded me that I was reading a story by an author--I never lost myself in the book--and ultimately I stopped reading. Never finished it. Its not that the ideas ran out, but rather than the prose was a bit predictable and distant."
5,Great Military Sci-Fi!!!,This is the story of John Perry and his enlistment into the Colonial Defense Force.The CDF's mission is to protect Earth and all other human colonies in the galaxy.In this first book you follow John through his basic training and subsequent battles that he and his fellow CDF soldiers fight against alien forces bent on human destruction\consumption.This book is a serious page turner!!! I loved it!!
3,Had its moments,"Old Man's War is a fast read that honestly doesn't have any surprises for long-time readers of science fiction. John Perry is a Mary Sue, but not an obnoxious one that you want to beat the tar out of. Random laugh out loud moments keep it from slipping into forgettable territory. Not fantastic, not horrible, this book is a good way to kill a dreary afternoon."
5,Light and fun,"Some people reviewing this book criticize the lack of hard ""science"". Not all science fiction has to be lengthy explorations of sophisticated tech paired with epic space opera. Some of the most successful science fiction franchises are anything but plausible. To that end: if you are seeking a novel of complex depth and hardcore believable tech then this is not for you. If you don't take things too seriously, then you may discover a gem. This is simple, rip-roaring fun and that invites you not to take things too seriously."
3,emminently forgetable except for the hype.,"Three stars means ""it's OK"" in Amazon terms. I would rather give Old Man's War one star to balance the giddy five star reviews. I can only assume that the readers that gave it five stars like classic old school science fiction from the 50's and 60's as Old Man's War reads like an old old book. The concepts are old, the science is old and the writing as dry as a very dry thing indeed. I couldn't believe the comparisons drawn with the giants of modern science fiction. One five star reviewer even states that it doesn't compare to something like Frank Herbert's Dune and I agree but if Dune is a five star book then how can this one be. I would like to suggest to Amazon that they change their rating system to one of ten stars like IMDB. It yields a much more accurate rating as there can be discrimination between great books and good books."
5,One of the Best!!!,"Easily on of my list of the top 5 sci-fi books of all time, Old Man's War is sublime.The sci-fi elements are top notch with a somewhat unique (and not unfathomable) twist on the ""supersoldier"" theme generally used to great effect in books like Armor and Starship Troopers.The story made me care about the well-developed characters and interesting missions. Scalzi really drew me into this universe. No character was the whiny ""Here is the emotion you should be feeling"" person used by lesser writers.The following two books, Ghost Brigades and Lost Colony, are excellent. Ghost Brigades has excellent action sequences and Lost Colony has a more political feel to it.This series should be a ""must read"" for any sci-fi fan."
4,Transhumanism and action with an interesting plot,"I'm fascinated by tales of transhumanism. Old Man's War is a novel concept that takes us to places we might find if we develop the technology to move the contents of a human mind around into various bodies. It's also much, much more.Scalzi's writing style is palatable. His plot devices worked for me. I found his characters interesting. It's a big universe out there, and Scalzi shows us what he imagines it might be like for humanity if we can ever move off our home planet.Military elements in Old Man's War are well crafted and plausible. I found the book to be hard to put down, which becomes rarer and rarer as I age."
5,Fantastic space opera,Very much like Heinlein. I loved the concept and execution of this book. Scalzi packs so much action and character development into this slim novel. I can't wait to read the sequels.
4,A Fine Read,"I really enjoyed this book. It has a very interesting premise and follows through on it (although it is somewhat incorrectly named). The dialog is often humorous, if not perfectly believable. The later part of the book becomes more serious, but in a good way. I recommend it highly."
3,Good light book not very hard science not action based or technical,"Decent Story, I can only understand 5 star reviews from that standpoint. Otherwise those people must not read much science fiction or like this light fast food time science fiction. Battles were fast and very undesrciptive. One of the aliens races I had no idea what it looked like and descriptions barely helped. The main character is basically god and cant barely do wrong and never has a bad idea. No great excitement but the story is decent enough that you will want to read it to finish. Not a bad idea for a universe just compared to alot of other books I read I felt like I was missing to much. If the author put a little more emphasis of fleshing out the action more instead of finishing up a huge battle in a page. I will read the sequels but I wont be buying it the same day like I do most stories I like."
5,An excellent read!,"I've been a huge fan of John Scalzi ever since I started reading his blog ""Whatever"" several years ago. I was apprehensive when I heard that he was publishing a science fiction novel -- but then I read it and was thrilled and relieved.Boy can *write*. Damn! Likeable characters, an intriguing storyline, and a plethora of original ideas. (Scalzi must have been feeding the idea fairies on his back porch something extra special). Now I just have to get my hands and eyes on The Ghost Brigades because I need more of this universe."
3,"A decent read, but lacking in a couple of areas","I ordered this book used, which helped lessen my overall disappointment with it, on the basis of a recommendation on a review of a Alistair Reynolds book. The poster on that review pointed to this book as a superior example of the theme of that book (Revelation Space).Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, it was OK hence the three stars. The characters while somewhat engaging, were kind of formulaic and one dimensional. Plot line could have been lifted from a WW II movie and proceeded pretty much as expected.If you want a light weight sci-fi beach book, you'll be fine, just don't expect much else"
4,Great premise and a story well told,"What a thoughtful and intriguing vision of the future that Scalzi portrays! This books really excites the imagination and was a joy to read. My biggest complaint was that the fun ended too soon. I haven't read much science fiction since reading the ""Foundation"" trilogy as a teenager, but this book has put me on the lookout for similar works, and I'll definitely add more Scalzi titles to my wish list."
3,"Old Man's War, an Interersting Concept","It was an interesting concept...On Earth, if you live to be 75, you can join the Colonial Defense Force, which means you give up all your earthly possessions (humor), get declared legally dead, you ship off to space and you can never go home again...You volunteer to serve for two years, or ten years if they need you. They need you. You assume they do something to make your body younger, because who needs a 75-year-old soldier?It's a 300-something page book and the first 100 pages aren't so interesting because it is basically a bunch of old farts wondering what is going to happen. That should have been reduced to 20 or 30 pages.After that, it gets better. There is the mandatory discussion about ""odds"" on living past two years, ten years, etc. There is training, this, and that, and so on, and some battles.Not a classic, but a good read once you get past the beginning."
3,"Tastes Light, Less Filling","Upon finishing it, I did wonder how this book became a Hugo Award finalist.While the book makes for a fun read over the course of a couple of sittings, it is indescribably unsatisfying. The story is sweet tasting but without any complex flavors. Character and story development are pretty run-of-the-mill here.Old Man's War was good enough that I'll want to read the next story, Ghost Brigade. But it's not good enough to warrant a purchase on Amazon. Public library here I come."
2,Ponderous fifties-style SF,"This book was a disappointment after all the good reviews on Amazon and the 2006 Hugo Award nomination. It is a clunker, with run-of-the-mill Heinlein style social and scientific extrapolations, but none of the subtlety, and pretty poor dialog. There is so much good speculative fiction around, that I recommend you do not waste your time with this."
5,"Entertaining, fast-paced book",This was a highly entertaining and fast-faced look at what war may be like in the future. The history of characters connected me to the individuals and I was upset when they were gone.I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
3,I was expecting so much more,I read good reviews on the internet about this book in which the author was compared to Heinlein and Haldeman. Unfortunately this book is just a shadow of those authors. I must agree with another reviewer that stated that the first few chapters were really great but then the book just ran out of steam. To me it's as if the writer was reading The Forever War page by page as he wrote this book. It's not a bad story. Just not in the same class as Star Ship Troopers or The Forever War. I was also some what surprised by the number of high marks here given for this book. I really wanted to like this novel but I just couldn't. And I so wanted to find a new author.
3,"Entertaining, expected more","I've read a lot of good praise for Old Man's War so I went into it with heightened expectations. I found it a quick, entertaining read, but I have a few criticisms: the main character's ""voice"" irritated me. The smart-alec hero does not translate well from TV to the printed page, and it was difficult for me to find him a sympathetic character. The plot seemed to meander all over the place with no real conflict or resolution, and I thought the ending was fairly abrupt, as if the author had just run out of inspiration. Overall, I rate this three stars."
3,Sci-fi from troop point of view,The story jumps all over the place when it comes to the technology. The battles in a strategic and even tactical level do not make sense. Author is mainly interested in the human and alien soldier part of the story.
5,"Great Read, totally recommend!",I got this book as part of the Humble Bundle eBook Edition. It is one of the most engaging and entertaining book I have read in a while. This is definitely a page turner and I highly recommend it.
4,Highly Enjoyable Sci Fi,"This is classic science fiction. We get the grand scope of a vast galaxy, filtered through the lens of one man, who learns alongside us about the perils of the universe outside of Earth's isolation, and what must be done to protect it and the human colony worlds. While I found a few moments far too convenient (like the survival of his two friends during the Coral Massacre), I found other moments to be satisfyingly gritty and real, like the stories of the deaths of the other members of his original group of friends. In a war where 75% of soldiers die before their commission is up, having all 7 of them survive would have been too far for my credulity to stretch.This is my first Scalzi novel, but I will be reading more, and I am thrilled to have found him. What a great piece of writing!"
4,Fun and entertaining,"Heinleinian but not Heinlein. Like Starship Troopers or not so much. A comparison to RH may be a little too much of an endorsement. Anyway, this book can stand alone without all that.This book is fun and entertaining. It isn't what I would call hard sci-fi although it has space elevators, alternate universes and space travel, brain pattern transference, tachyons, etc. It is mostly about modified humans warring with a variety of aliens over real estate, resources, and possibly religion. Spattered blood and guts and all that.Get the hard cover book if you can: the artwork is worth it."
3,Very pleasant diversion,"I was mightily impressed with the relatively literary treatment many sci-fi conventions receive in Scalzi's book. It's a quick read and covers some interesting science and sociology/psychology territory. The nicest thing is that a lot of seemingly random circumstances and events wrap back up with no glaring loose ends and an ending that's more ""Local Hero"" than Walt Disney. Definitely worth a read for people who enjoy Heinlein."
2,If Military Science Fiction has a menu...,"...this book is the Kid's Meal.Lightweight science, philosophy, dialogue, plot.After Pournelle, Drake, Haldeman and Heinlein, this is pitiful stuff.If you're looking for purely entertaining space opera, look up Bujold.The Heinlein quote on the cover suckered me in; won't happen twice."
1,Kindle price insanely high,"Kindle price insanely high. What the hell are you thinking, Amazon? Kindle price way above paperback, on a book this old? That's just not going to fly."
5,Great book,"I have to say I really enjoyed this book overall. The first 1/3 of the book is the better part, as he draws you into the world and creates a lot of mystery around what's happening etc. The rest is mostly action, missions, fighting etc which is still well written, but lacked the intrigue I got from the first part. Overall it's pretty fast paced and easy to read. I read it in just two evenings so it's probably on the short side."
3,Good book,"I was a bit suprised this was a nebula nominated book.I mean, it was good and all. The beginning and the ideas were engaging. Then it went into a bunch of light battle descriptions that really had no tension, no sense of being there. I also think the author was a bit too clever, which took away a bit mid book.Then I got hit by the ending, which I really liked.Overall good book. If like military sci-fi you should check it out."
3,"Good, but not great","I would just reiterate what some others here have already said. This is a good book, but not what I would call great. Scalzi is definitely a good writer and I will give him that. I will also say the book makes some interesting points and paints an interesting view of one possible future. Most of the book seems plausible though other parts kind of made me raise an eyebrow (I won't go into specifics so as not to spoil anything). As for all the people who seem to try and rebuff every negative criticism of the book, I think they are probably just looking for a deeper meaning that isn't there. There is plenty of originality in the book, but there are plenty of ideas that are just rehashes of other novels (I'm not saying he plagiarized or anything, just that the ideas aren't all new)."
2,Take it or leave it.,"I've read worse SF books than this, but many that were much, much better. If you're looking for something light but more engaging than a magazine, this might be good. It certainly doesn't warrant a five-star rating or words such as ""superb."" Yech."
4,Vastly entertaining,"For anyone familiar with military sci-fi, this book won't be terribly new or innovative, but it will be vastly entertaining. I'm not going to include any spoilers in this review; there are plenty of reviews out there that can do that for you. However, I will say that if you've ever been through Basic Training, you'll probably laugh outright at the training scenes, and Scalzi has done a good job of creating a unique and compelling world. His characters are strong and vibrant and make me want to know more about them and their world. The book itself is an extremely easy read, but it's engaging for all that. The perfect lunch break or after work mental vacation, and I highly recommend it (it's better than the squeals, too, but they're not bad either; it's just better). Only reason it's not a five-star rating is because it takes a whole lot to get me to a ""perfect"" rating."
4,Good Read,"I'm not a huge war-sci fi fan, but I really enjoyed this book. I liked the characters, I liked the story and plot, and I liked the action. I wouldn't call it hard sci-fi, but there is good science and it is presented as feasible and plausible.If you've read any Verner Vinge's ""Zones of Thought"" books, I think you'll like this book. At least it's much much shorter :)"
5,Old Man's War,I am an avid reader as well as an author myself and I loved this book! Couldn't wait to read the sequel and anything else that this author writes. Great work John! Keep 'em coming!
4,Good readin,"This is a very good book. Easy and quick and excelent story.You can believe in the characters and attach to them. At some parts, the story gets you thinking about life and human relations.I reccomend for a fun-reading experience."
5,Would you sell your soul to live forever?,Fast forward to the far future where the military-industrial complex controls the technology that can ensure virtual immortality. The only catch? You have to be an indentured warrior. They own your soul.Scalzi is an interesting author who puts a unique spin on the epic war hero mythos. The story is fast paced and exciting but at times the character feels disconnected and without a voice. This may be intentional to project that the main character has sold his soul for immortality so when the chance for redemption appears you feel his soul may be intact beneath it all. At least I hope so.
2,A pale shadow of 'The Forever War'...,"I'm glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it based on all the rave reviews here. This is so clearly a retread of ""The Forever War,"" by Joe Haldeman, that it was a chore to read. Yes, Scalzi does add a dash of Heinlein, but then I was always very ambivalent about Heinlein when I was reading him in the 1960s... too jingoistic and misogynistic. I'll try another Scalzi book at some point, but it won't be because of this tepid effort."
4,An Excellent Read!,This was a very good book. I would highly recommend it to any science fiction or military fiction reader. There were some very interesting and unique features in the story. I will definitely consider reading more from this author.
4,Good book,This was the first of John Scalzi's novels that I've read. Looking forward to reading others in the upcoming months.
3,"Strong start, but familiar finish","I loved the premise and first half of OMW, but I thought the last half stopped breaking new ground, and fell back on cliched military experiences. Aliens became too human, and the military ops were also familiar. I had hopes the introduction of Ghost Brigade troops would boost the last half, but that left me flat as well.I think ""Forever War"" and ""Starship Troopers"" did it better!That said, do check out Scalzi's ""Redshirts"", it's an amazing read!"
1,Boring,"Life in a space military thousands of years in the future, as written by John Scalzi, is as unimpressive civilian life in here in the early 21st century for the most part. Much of the story is told in mess halls as character's sit around having obnoxious conversations. When the action finally does come it's brief and underwhelming; the main characters shoot a few aliens and the action is over.As a former sailor I know military life can be dull at times but just the same I didn't want to read a novel about a bunch of space soldiers having lunch."
4,Great premise,"I really enjoyed this book and its new take on an old sci-fi theme. the story has been done before, but Scalzi twists the plot a bit, and his excellent writing make this book a joy to read."
3,not bad...,"Well, it may sound absolutely nothing like anything else the band's ever done, but this really isn't a terrible album. There's a kind of charming innocence about it that we haven't seen in any of their later work (no irony here), and while the songs aren't exactly awe-inspiring, tunes like My Lighthouse, Joking Aside, and Love Love are good enough that the Pulp devotee should hear them."
2,limited,"info on Pharaohs is good, but quite limitedfor the most part...this is a 'general' dog guide not much (not even a third)with regards to Pharaoh hounds"
2,Red Slayer,"It is a great disappointment, due to several historical errors. The most troubling error, when dr. Doherty states: Shalom is an Islamic greeting. It is a Hebrew one for millennia. Islamic/Muslim greeting is: Salem Alejkum."
1,A horrible Edit job,"I bought this book with the expection of the ""100% Pure Manga!"" blurb on the back being true to its word. I am a fan of Oh!Great's work, so I was expecting none of it to be censored.What to my shining eyes did see but EDITS. Lots of 'em! Edits so poorly conceived that they actually impair understanding of the story!CMX titles are definetely off my list, and if you are at all interested in reading ""100% pure manga"" then CMX is not the outlet for you. Do not buy this for yourself or as a gift, you are wasting your money."
3,"Nice bag, wish the gray/silver was so dark","I wanted something colorful, the picture is colorful. The product is colorful but the gray/silver takes too much of the color dots aways. It needs more red, green, white and other colors to make it more artsy. I wanted something different, and it's no so different. Does it's purpose but doesn't have that WOW to it."
3,Disappointed,"Although I usually love detail in reading history, this book overwhelms with detail. I read 220 pages and then skimmed. It's true historians by profession should get more out of THROUGH A FIERY TRIAL, but for the average reader and lover of history which I am, this book is not for you."
2,Not that great,"I picked up one of these at a store about a year ago and theres definitely nothing to brag about. My led breaks often when i try to sharpen them (especially color pencils) and my number one complaint is that the top is very loosely fit on the container so it easily falls off, spilling all of the pencil shavings everywhere. For as cheap as hand held sharpeners usually go for, I would definitely recommend something else."
1,Poor quality,"Very inexpensive sharpener. In many cases your pencils will cost more than the sharpener itself.But it's a good sharpener to avoid. It chews up the wood of colored pencils, and never gets a sharp point. For lead pencils, the awful blade cuts to a dull, blunt point. By design, this will never sharpen pencils well. Not even worth the low price. It's a shame, because Staedtler has made some very fine products before."
5,Psychology and the rise of the sociopath.,"The rise in sociopathic behavior among adults and children is troublesome, and this title by a leading psychologist discusses the trends, incidence and treatment of sociopathic antisocial attitudes. This not only explains the problem, it draws important correlations between causes and solutions which include social as well as personal approaches."
3,Incisive but Informative,"This was a very helpful book in getting an overall perspective on antisocial behavior. Though it came off a bit caustic at times - and also seemed to overly generalize to the exclusion of specifics - Wolman's book is an easy, accessible, and informative read for anyone curious about sociopathic/psychopathic behavior, its origins, and its implications for ""society"" at large."
5,quality,"From ordering to shipping, this was a quality transaction. I will order again from this company, with the solid assurance that comes from purchasing through Amazon.Thank you"
1,Russell Athletic Pro Cotton Pocket Tee Mens,"You advertised Russell Athletic Pro Cotton Tee but you sent me Russell Cotton Performance. This is a cheaper tee and does not fit as well, so i was not happy with the purchase and will not buy again!"
3,Only certain colors are 100% cotton,"From the Russell Athletic website:* Fabric: 100% Ringspun Cotton, 6.0 oz./sq. yd.* Graphite, Indigo Heather, Navy Heather, Oxford: 55% Cotton/45% PolyesterSo be careful which color you order or you may get a cotton/poly blend. Also, these are not the rugged heavy cotton tees that Russell made for decades. They're still a decent quality but not what they once were."
3,Russell,The review would have been higher but some thing has changed and the Tee's now shrink after washing. They are excellent compared to Hanes
2,These USED to be good,"Russell ""Cotton Performance"" pocket T-shirts have been my old standard for years, until recently, as the old shirts have been discontinued, and replaced by a cheaper (but not less expensive) substitute (the old shirts had a white tag which read ""Russell Athletic/Cotton Performance"" in the LL corner on the front). The substitute is thinner, has a poorer cut, and is poorly stitched (I use the pocket for my reading glasses; several have torn out after just 1 or 2 washings). Don't be fooled! The current Russell pocket Ts are CRAP.This company must be trying to squeeze a few more pennies from us. It can be nothing less than corporate greed. They won't be getting any more of MY money."
2,What once was,"Russell simply stated, doesn't make by mail order the quality of shirt they once did. There will not be a re-order."
5,Russell Athletic Pocket - T's,I have worn Russell Athletic Pocket T's for over 15 years. My first RA Pocket T's were bought as irregulars at a Big Lot store some 15 years ago. They were selling them for $1.00 with the neck label cut off but the RA monograms on the sleeve and bottom were intact.Since then I have bought quite a few from various sources and will continue to purchase Nothing but this item as long as they make them.P.S. I still have and wear 2 of my original purchase after all of these years..
1,Better buy it at the store.,"I am familiar with this product, it came perfect, labels, box, etc.It smell the same BUT it doesn't last after I use it.For some reason I use it and in less than an hour the smell is gone.It seems to me like a fake product.I tried to return it but I am not allowed."
4,Great Scent but slightly generic,"Good classic scent, but I would not describe it as unique in any way. If you are looking for something more memorable this cologne isn't for you."
3,Good product,This didn't smell how I hoped it would smell like. Smells a bit medicinal if you ask me. Glad I just got the sampler.
5,Eternity,This product is a must buy. You can get it on here for a lot less price than going to the mall to the big box stores. Yes it does smell the same as the $100 bottles you just save aa lot more money!Eternity For Men By Calvin Klein - Edt Spray 6.7 Oz
2,Is not like at Store,"I changed my EDT from D&G; light blue to Eternity because it smelled good and lasted long at Kohl's store; therefore decided to buy from Amazon. However, it is not the same:Smelled: Smell is not I smelled at Kohl's store;Lasted: Lasting is not long as it lasted when I used at Kohl's.Packaged: is original package.Eternity by Calvin Klein for Men - 6.7 Ounce EDT Spray"
3,Eternity,Its okay I guess. The sample bottle is not a spray so it gets concentrated in one spot and I can't tell if it smells bad or just too much at once. I'll give it another chance though!
2,Not great,"I'm pretty nice when it comes to reviews, but I really didn't like this product. It just plain didn't smell good. The reviews I was reading made this stuff out to be some sort of airborne aphrodisiac.Not in my opinion.It smelled like fruity mosquito repellent. Next time I take my family or friends out into the woods, maybe I should bring some.But it isn't all bad. If you like smelling like a hardcore camper, each application will last you quite a while. When I tried it, it lasted me a good couple hours.Maybe I just got a different nose than these other reviewers.Recommended: No.2.5 stars"
3,"worth watching, but...","This film is notable mostly for having one of Anthony Quinn's best performances, and one of Ray Milland's worst. And why oh why that god-awful song to start things off? Couldn't be more misleading, and no, I don't think that was the point."
5,comfort,"this was the most uplifting book i have ever read.Gracia, is truly a child of God. I would love to meether.She has a heart that sees beyond this earth.I will turn to this book often for comfort."
3,"Gracia Burnham's second book, to Fly Again","It's a devotional book, not the narrative I was expecting. Sent it to the thrift store where someone else may want it."
2,disk golf lover,"These disks are not worth buying... they are not durable, one shot to a tree and the led lights are dead... they are very light weight and are not stable in flight, if your a sidearm thrower you have not chance in throwing these disks like me... Also when i received them they were all scratch up along the tops and bottom... I do not recommend the purchase of this product"
3,"A or B, not A+B","Have been disappointed in this receiver. It doesn't do well as an audio receiver. The sound quality doesn't match the sound quality of previous audio receivers I've had. It's ok for movies, but doesn't provide the sound quality I expect for audio. Also, it won't drive two pairs of stereo speakers at the same time.It has left me wanting to look for a replacement, which is irksome after putting so much money on this purchase. I want a receiver that places audio first, or at least doesn't treat it as an afterthought."
4,Calm Delight,This CD offers a nice blend of classical melodies. It is a good collection of calm and delightful songs that are inspiring and perfect for setting a relaxing atmosphere.
5,Beautiful,"This CD takes Hillsongs Australia's best music and turns it into instrumental only sets that are perfect for relaxing, de-stressing, and doing devotions to. If you love Hillsong Australia or Darlene Zschech's music, this is a must-have in your collection. I would also recommend this album to worshippers who want something other than hymns that's not incredibly upbeat and want to put ""a new song"" in their heart!"
3,What happened Fatlip?,"When I bought this single, I was hoping that Fatlip would have a lot of time since Labcabincalifornia to make up atleast 2 songs that are off the hook. What's Up Fatlip? is a mediocre song that's only good feature is its video directed by Spike Jonze. Goldmine is slow and even though the rhymes are clearly Fatlip's, it made me skip over it after a couple of sceonds. I love Edy's Groove but no Fatlip! Overall, I wish Fatlip would get back with the Pharcyde because of their diverse and tight production."
2,Not the best,"I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in this film, I don't know why but I expected a better story and more interesting characters. It was really pretty boring and it seemed like Ty Power was doing a parody of pirate movies."
2,"Scuttled by power, salvaged(somewhat) by Cregar","Beautiful colour cinematography and lush setings are destroyed by Mr. Powers sulky performance as a bully and molester of women. The star mops around the film in such a conceited manner that one wishes him to be run through by George Sanders, who plays in a fine piratical form. The films other main fault is the lack of action, the first three reels are almost completly composed of talk. When the lacklustre action finale finally comes it is handled with unbeliveable ineptitude by Mr. King, he seems to have sped up much of the footage. Though damaged beyond repair by Power's performance and King's direction, it is boosted by Cregar's brilliant performance as SirHenry Morgan, but alas a supporting charachter can do only so much."
5,Lots of fun,"As the Governor of Jamaica, Henry Morgan asks that all pirate activities in the area cease. Jamie Waring (Tyrone Power), a friend of Morgan and ""former"" pirate tries to court the previous governor's daughter Margaret (Maureen O'Hara) much to her dismay. When pirating activities increase with Morgan as governor, he is accused of being in cahoots with Captain Leech (George Sanders), who refused to give up the life he loves. Jamie sets off to find Leech and the Black Swan (Leech's ship) and kidnaps Margaret along the way. Captain Morgan, believing Jamie betrayed him sets off after Jamie and the fun ensues."
4,Where's Errol Flynn When You Really Need Him?,"You get the feeling in ""The Black Swan"" that Tyrone Power could never force himself away from the mirror long enough to play a lowdown pirate convincingly. He seems like the man atop the wedding cake, especially in scenes with the lovely Maureen O'Hara. With his stiff American accent and pretty-boy ways, Power is a laughable pirate. This is a Hollywood costume picture in the worst sense. Eye-candy, to be sure, but the movie never transports you away from the soundstages of 20th-Century Fox. What's missing is the rakish charm and athleticism of the true swashbuckler of the screen, Errol Flynn, and the frantic, exciting direction of Michael Curtiz. Check out ""The Sea Hawk"" and ""Captain Blood,"" bona-fide classics from Warner Bros., to get a real flavor of mischief and high adventure on the untamed seas."
2,sabatini has been served better on film,"what with the several superior tyrone power adventure movies that have not yet appeared on dvd (""captain from castile"", ""suez"", ""blood and sand"" among them), its a disappointment that this flat pirate movie has recently appeared. while i normally love swashbucklers, there is little to recommend here, short of the admittedly beautiful technicolor. maureen o'hara & george sanders appear in the olivia de haviland & basil rathbone parts, and theyre ok, but power is soporific in the errol flynn part. a disappointment."
2,tedious,"Far from being an engaging swashbuckler, it quickly degenerates into our hero's boorish attempts to woo the petulant lady."
3,Great Tyrone Power movie!,"Swashbuckling and romance movie the way Hollywood used to make them. No special effects, just great acting."
5,Love it,"First i have seen this movie a few times, also have it vhs. I love all types of movies. plus the shipper was faster than the expected delivery date. Again, I always have loved this movie, and i am glad i have the dvd... Now if only the remaining titles on my list were to come out.. like The Spanish Main (Paul Henreid 1945), Against all Flags(errol flynn, 1952) and at swords point(Cornel Wilde,1952)and black sheild of Falsworth( tony curtis) My collection would be complete. Thank you amazon!!!"
4,ONE OF THE BEST,"The Black Swan is one of the best of the pirate movie genre. Tyrone Power is not as charismatic as Errol Flynn but he is dashing enough to carry the part off. Maureen O'Hara is beautiful and spirited so we root for her. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two leads is rooted a bit too much in the sexism of the time and seems off-putting to a modern audience. But the movie has few flaws other than that and has much to make it worth watching. The color and action are first rate. The story is fun. The special effects, especially the large scale model ships, are outstanding for the period. There is a shot of a ship running ashore that combines a model and live actors that is really stunning. It is the one image that I remembered from this movie over decades. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good swashbuckler."
5,the black swan,one perfect match!! handsome Ty and gorgeous Maureen with wonderful and skillful supporting actors make this film as one of the best swashbucklers ever made. unbelievable that someone could shoot such colour almost 60 years ago!!! these were the days when the stars were really stars. i enjoy every moment of the film even today.
5,The Black Swan,I loved this movie! I am a big fan of swashbuckler movies. This movie is just fun and entertaining.
5,Tyrone Power-The Perfect Pirate,"I remember as a child watching all the great old pirate movies with my Dad on Friday nights. Tyrone Power was always one of our favorites and The Black Swan is one movie that stood out in memory for me. It is a beautifully filmed and vastly entertaining film and one I just had to add to my ""good ole days"" section of my DVD library. If you love pirates-don't pass up on this treasure."
5,A Woman Needs to Review This Film,"Glancing over the comments of some other reviewers here, one would think this was a ""pirate"" movie. Well, yes, it is. More importantly, however, it is a romance, a film that very likely helped inspire the bodice-buster historicals that were so popular in the 1970's. Romances are fantasies and in such, it doesn't matter that the hero is prettier than he should be or if George Sanders' beard looked strange.For the women reading this, go rent this movie! Lots of fun, fun, fun with titillating scenes (tame for now) not usually allowed by the movie code. Tyrone Power as Captain Waring never looked so good and is shown shirtless, splattered with wine, and stretched on a rack for your pleasure.The tepid romance in Captain Blood with Errol Flynn is barely two stars compared with this movie."
5,Swashbuckling At It's Best!,"Old fashioned thrills, with swords, knives and pirates. Handsome men in flamebouyant costumes, beautiful women in frilly lace and gowns of silk and satin! What more can you ask of a movie except georgeous ships and tropical isles. Well look no more, it's all right here! Romance, old movie style, where the man only gets the girl at the END of the show. What a novel idea! Loved every moment of it, and you will too."
4,The Black Swan,"This was bought as a gift, my husband loves the sea faring stories, Tyrone Power is a great actor. The story and plot is very exciting and would recommend buying this for your husband and fathers. A true man's movie. A must for classic collectors."
3,I like Maureen Ohara,Nice to see how pretty she was in her younger days. Very good movie with her high spirits . It was just a good pirate movie.
5,Great swashbuckling movie,"It's a great film with lots of action, plus some pretty funny lines. If you like Tyrone Powers or are a fan of ""Captain Blood"", you will enjoy this movie. It would have been nice to have special features about the making of the film itself, but the movie easily stands on its own."
1,creepy boring,"while one can appreciate the extremely creepy setting and stylishly dark direction,I found that the story had little to offer,more like nothing,actually.The film is about two taylor siblings reunited,which sets one of them onto a derranged homocidal journey.The acting is so-so,the dialogue is non-existent and the movie itself is bleak,drab and lifeless.I haven't found it scary or even spooky,occasionaly it gets mildly creepy,but that alone is nowhere near enough to compensate for 90 or so wasted minutes of your life."
1,yawn fest,"This movie is lame, slow, boring, low budget and a sad, sad pathetic excuse for a film. This doesn't even deserve one star, there is probably as much as 20 words spoken in this movie and that includes the '12, 15' for when the tailors are guessing the waist, hips, etc sizes. I was truly shocked when I saw that this had more than 1 star for the average reviews. Half of this movie is zoomed in on the main characters face while he slowly goes crazy, taking all of us with him. If this movie gets more than 1 star from you ... you really need to expand your movie collection."
4,Starting to learn...,"The book is exactly as it's title states, it is a 'simple guide'. Having said that, it is a good introduction to understanding basic etiquette and helped build a better picture for someone who has never been to the middle east. This book would certainly be a useful 'pocket guide', however I was left wanting for more information."
1,Not for grading,"I bought these to grade papers. However, the pencils mark so lightly and unreliably that they are unusable."
2,Get the 1973 version by Joe Karbo instead!,"The Lazy Man's Way to Riches, by Joe Karbo, written in 1973, was outstanding. It revealed closely held and unusual information, some of which Joe learned in high priced business seminars in the 60's. Joe was way ahead of his time, and you will get tremendous value from the original book. But beware, the 20th anniversary revised edition from 1993 contained lots of extra information, written a decade after Joe's death, and some was in direct conflict with the original text. Before buying this 30th anniversary edition, get a used copy of the original, 1st edition by Joe Karbo from 1973 - there are plenty on Amazon right now."
2,"Cumbersome, yet imcomplete","I bought the Nixon updated version of The Lazy Man's Way in November 2004. The book is in two parts. First is the book you purchase. Then there's a ""shadow"" book, which apparently consists of workbook-type exercises, and is only available via online registration. The online registration promises all sorts of resources as of December 1, 2004. A month later, save for the first two chapters of the online book, nothing is available, and my emails to customer service have gone unanswered. I did just notice that the book has a 2005 copyright date. I've never heard of a post-dated copyright (have you?); but regardless, if you promise something in business, aren't you supposed to deliver? Or do you just make promises, collect the cash and go into hiding? I guess that's ONE lazy man's way to riches. I understand the original of this book is brilliant. If that's the case, I'd hate to see the title sullied by poor website management and customer service."
1,The Author Doesn't Support His Own Product ... neither does the publisher!,"It's now 2006. I just bought this book, mainly because of all of the online bonuses and workbooks promised -- Oops. There aren't any online resources available.I like the earlier version of the book, but this edition refers me to the workbook that I can('t) get online. Each time the book sends me to the elusive site, I feel cheated.I contacted Wiley (The publishers). They said that the site was supported by the author, and that they had contacted the author long ago about the problem.Then they told me to have a nice day.Is there any way to ""impeach"" this author?Keith Pascal, author of Wrist Locks: From Protecting Yourself to Becoming an Expert"
2,Falls short,"The advertisements that prompted me to buy this dvd were 30 second tv type commercials with very lively and entertaining cg, and music. The musical soundtrack on the dvd is incredibly amaturish, distractingly bad, and falls far short of the creativity the stories, animation, and accompanying sound effects attain. This made the dvd all but unwatchable for me. Very disappointing to see this production fall so far short of it's potential."
2,This cable doesn't really do anything.,"Unfortunately, you cannot simply transfer component video signal to vga. You need special hardware for that. Don't be fooled by the simple appearance of this cable. Unless you have a magic display device, this cable will do nothing."
3,Not as funny as I expected,"I bought this DVD because I previously watched Sanky Panky and it was halirious. This movie had the same actors, but their parts weren't as big and it wasn't as funny. Also, it seemed like the beginning was dragged out, and the part that should have been the climax seemed to be sped through."
2,It's Okay,"Baby loves it. But, it plays for less than 5 minutes. Just when he is about to start enjoying it. I have to rewind it at least 4 times. Very frustrating. Doesn't help me get things done when I have to stand there and rewind again & again. Baby is almost 7 weeks and just starting to pay this item any attention. It would be helpful it this thinglasted at least 10 minutes (I would even consider getting one that required batteries). If it had a timer that I could control that would be great as well. Would not buy. Received as a baby shower gift."
4,Nice shirt,"I got these to embroider for my husband's work shirts. The are not bad quality, and the sizing is correct."
3,ok,"ok, but a little thin, would be nice if thicker shirt,.like the idea of no iron.lots of colors. price high for this kind of shirt."
5,Floor mats in my 03 mustang.,"Of course since these are not made specifically for my car the do not fit excatly. But aside from that for being a generic size mat, they fit perfectly. Just at the very end near my pedals does it warp up a bit. Very satisfied with the price and look."
5,Highly recommended,"You can't beat the quality and price of these, they look like they would cost 3 times the price. In fact, these look better than the last set I bought (for another car) and are half the price. I think I'm going to have to trim the driver's seat one because it covers up the foot-rest in my car, but these stay in place well and look fantastic."
2,Did Not fit 2007 Impala,"The quality was decent but the description said that it would fit in a 2007 Impala, which was not the case. The front passenger and the back seat floor mats fit fine, but the driver side did not fit at all. Based on this I could not use the mats because the mat kept popping up over the gas pedal which is not a good thing when you are driving."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was thinking that I was getting a great deal on some car mats, but I was wrong. They are very thin, the carpet seems more like a thick fabric, and the mats do not stay in place. I'm leaving them in my car for now, but I'm sure they won't hold up. I guess I'm used to stock mats. I would not reoommend this product, but if you just need a cheap fix, they are okay."
2,4 Piece Car Mats,Was looking for floor mats to fit my car.These did not. Expected better quality.Probably would not recommend these unless you needed something for a older vehicle.
2,very cheap,will not stay in place moves around very easy it is made very cheap it compares to one at the 99 cent store
3,Rubber queen car mats.,Not bad for the money. Drivers side mat doesn't fit well in my BMW. Keeps sliding over gas petal. Dirt hard to vacuum of mats.
2,Don't expect much,Whoever photographed these mats did a great job of making themlook a lot better than they really are. Instead of ordering herego to your local Walmart and buy them for less and pay no shipping.
5,what smell??,PERFECT fit for my Grand Prix. Left a window cracked a tiny bit yesterday and just checked this morning and there is no smell at all.
4,Good for what they are...,"Which is cheap floormat replacements. If you want the really nice ones, then pay the $75-$100 for the dealer replacements. If you just want to swap in some new mats that may only last a year or so, this is what you want. They're thin, but look nice. Fit well."
4,"Nice, solid set of car mats",My only criticism of these well priced car mats would be that the rear passenger rugs are a bit undersized. Other then that it was no brainer to tidy up the insides of my 10yr old vehicle.
3,Be careful of the size,I purchased it for my 2011 Lexus GS 350. The front part of it which is under the brake area was too big for my car. I did not want to take any chances especially with a Lexus. So I had to return it. It was not bad quality though. Just make sure it fits right.
5,They get the job done!!,"I ordered these for my 2004 VW Jetta, and they work great. Yes, they may feel a little bit cheap but you do get what you pay for. I am pleased with them. They get the job done and seem just durable enough. Our driveway isn't paved, it is rocks, so it is nice to have in my car to just shake the rocks out instead of having to vacuum them out all the time.I was thankful to read the other reviews about the staples when you are taking the floor mats apart. It is true, be careful with them. They can rip the floor mats when you are dis-assembling them, and also very sharp (obviously! lol)I do recommend these to anyone in need of some decent floor mats!!"
4,Great,"I mainly got these cloor mats for looks so i could have a all black interior and they are great, universal. the only problem is fuzz continusly comes off but still good"
3,Great for the money,These mats are very basic but give the car carpet some protection. For the money they get the job done.
3,cheaply made,"I've used these for about 4-10 months now and the bottom rubber feet things have already ground down to nothing, decent set though for the price.would not buy again"
4,Identical to my original mats,"I drive a 2002 Nissan Xterra, which had the original floor mats up until I purchased these and they match perfectly. They stay put too."
5,Awesome looking quality mats!!,"Just got mats in last night. These are very reasonable mats and are awesome quality. They are not thick mats and if your going to be in any rugged terrain I wouldn't recommend these, you will see all the dirt. The black of these mats are bold and match my car even though my interior isn't 100% black. Only issue I have is that the driver side mat goes over the foot rest. It could be just that my car width isn't wide enough. My first impression with these mats in my car is defiantly a 5/5 for looks, 3/5 sturdiness, and 7/5 for economical price."
4,"Standard floor mat, good price","For the price, you can't beat these floor mats. I suspect they would fit most cars. They are a neutral gray color and fit nicely in our Honda Civic."
4,Great Product for the price!,"Great product for the price. Made well, and actually exceeded my expectations. I recommend them without reservation to anyone looking for low cost durable mats."
1,Review,"The mats were nice but they did not fit my car...so before you buy they should say what kind of car they go in, because it was a waste of time for me."
5,"Great floor mats, didn't fit my 2006 Jeep Liberty","For $15 these are a steal. Really nice, really well made floor mats with a universal fit. Unfortunately for me, the Jeep Liberty I purchased used uses some really small and ultra-shaped floor mats and these didn't fit.I thought about cutting them to fit, but I'm going to see if I can find some that fit better at the auto parts store. These fit fine in my roommates Camaro and Elantra so you will probably have better luck than I did."
3,Too many shades of beige,"I was willing to risk $20 to buy floor mats online, but I may as well have thrown it out the window...the Rubber Queen ""beige"" and the ""beige"" in my car are quite different, so much so that the mats just look stupid."
1,Terrible Quality,"Constantly move underfoot. Terrible, lightweight, disgusting. Ended up in the trash within a few weeks. Huge waste of money - very disappointed Amazon..."
4,Great for the price!,These are more durable and better quality than I had anticipated for the price. They also dull the road noise nicely. Only thing is the piece that goes under your heels is too high in the matt and end up under the petals. I have a 08 fit.
4,Cheap and Effective,"I would recommend this to a friend. If you're a real auto-aficionado you might want to try something a little pricier. For my purposes, I'm satisfied."
4,Floor mats,"Exactly what I was looking for, inexpensive mats that stay in place, don't move around as you're driving."
2,Cheap,"Spend a little more money and get a better set of mats. The carpet is nothing fancy, and does not like to be cleaned up that well. There is no hole for factory anchor points for floor mats, so the drivers side is constantly creeping up under the pedals. The rear mats are very small.But what do you want for what you are paying for them. If you have a old P.O.S car and dont car just want something in there, then these will work. If you want something of decent quality, move to another item."
2,Slide around a LOT,I have a 96 Maxima. These mats do not stay in one place. I have constantly put them back in their place. Not worth it.
3,I got a different one haha,I bought this item because i needed a floor mat for my car.The shipping was very fast it came 2 days after i purchased it. The problem is that they sent me a different one. They sent me a rubber floor mat but its all good i dont really care the product that they sent me was bdk rubber floor mat. Overall im pretty pissed that they sent me a different one but its okay.
2,"very thin, a good deal but very thin",when i purchased these mats i was thinking it wasgoing to be a thick mat that i was getting for mycar. the mat itself is very thin and seems to bejust a thin carpet fabric material.another problem that i found is that the mats donot really stay in place and it is very easy forthings to get under them. i guess you get whatyou pay for.
4,Can't beat the price,"As someone else said, floor mats are made for putting your dirty feet on.These are good enough for me!Color is a very sandy tan, and not dark like an Amazon cardboard box."
4,used in minivan,I put these in my wife's Dodge minivan and they worked out well. They stay put and the area for the drivers side feet are placed properly. The quality is exceptional for the price.
3,"Display is hard to read , just average","The caller ID display is hard to read but overall, it's just your average phone: not terrific but not terrible either. And the price is right too."
1,Disappointed,"This phone worked fine for about a year, and is now very erratic as far as the Caller ID window goes. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it is just white.Also, the hook for the earpiece is very small and allows the piece to fall off.The sound is fine, but the general phone is below expectations."
2,ergonomically awful...,I find this phone to be extremely hard to manage. There are several buttons on the outside of the receiver that are in the center where you put your hand to hold the phone and several on the inside of the receiver. No comfortable place to hold it which often causes cutting people off by accident. Too many buttons in the wrong place and a slippery texture that wants to slide. Not very well designed at all.
1,Blah phone,"I sent it back. The price was right but the caller ID didn't function. When I got in touch with AT&T, they told me, maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home. (Stupid Response!) I then asked, why would AT&T put a phone on the market that's not compatible with my other phones, I didn't get a reply!!! They wanted to send me a replacement. I told them there is no point in doing that, if, the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones! I guess AMAZON will be sending it back to AT&T."
1,FAILED AFTER 5 MONTHS-AT&T WON'T HONOR THEIR OWN WARRANTY!!,"It seemed like a great product until it forgot how to hang up the phone line, which happened after 5 months of occasional use. The (800) number for warranty service provides a message that ""Warranty Service for this Model has been Discontinued"" and refers you to the AT&T web site. Using ""contact us"" on the web site resulted in an email suggesting that I call the (800) number. So much for a one-year warranty, and so much for ""GENUINE AT&T QUALITY"". Next time I'm buying another brand."
1,Do Not But This Phone,"The caller i-d has no light. The caller i-d requires batteries. If you are on a call, and your call-waiting beeps, the phone does not tell you who's calling. Don't waste a dime. Not a dime. Period."
3,A word of advice.,"I've got 3 of these stops. Overall I'm happy with them. My only criticism is the plastic bolt they come with. I had an issue with one of the bolts binding in the metal nut and not working. I've since replaced them all with metal bolts. Given that replacement bolts will set you back less than $1 for a 3"" full thread 1/4-20 bolt. I don't understand why the manufacturer would include plastic bolts. I still use the round plastic nut for adjustment. If this is an item you plan to use frequently then I would suggest the upgrade."
4,Hardware issues,The mini-trak T-bolt and T-nut don't always work properly and may require the additional purchase of different T-nuts and T-bolts. I've heard Kreg has problems with supplying the proper hardware for their products.
5,Charanga 76' mellow sound......,"I attended college with Andrea the flute player of Charanga 76' when she told me of this recording I purchased it, and thier sound is so fresh and up-beat, they used the cow bell, which made it more exciting to dance. ''note '' the cow bell is not a standard instrument you would use in the charanga music......this is a must have cd, a collecters item, check it out you will enjoy it....'' SOY '' IS ONE OF THE TUNES AND IT'S SMOKING.......MAMBOCANO..."
5,Great Instructional Video,"I own several instructional videos from many famous guitarists covering progressive rock, jazz and blues genres. When it comes to covering theory, this is the best by far. Scott really goes deep into scale and arpeggio options for both major and minor chord types in the first section. The second section strongly emphasizes phrasing and building runs that sound fluid and cohesive over chord progressions. Lots of other very helpful material here. This DVD will keep me busy for a long time to come. Definitley a must have for somebody wanting to expand their chops beyond your basic pentatonic and major and minor scales."
5,lamy dialog,"excellent pen, beautiful packaging and good value, recommended. my experience with this purchase has been entirely satisfactory, all the service is perfect"
5,Lamy Dialog 1 ballpoint pen,"I have enjoyed Lamy pens for many years. The Lamy Dialog 1 is another impressive looking, smooth writing pen.I appreciate fine design in a quality product and I plan to treasure this pen for a long time.Lamy Dialog 1 Richard Sapper LE Ballpoint Pen - Titanium L274"
1,Outrageous Shipping,This tiny not-so-fragile $7 ornament could very easily have been sent in a padded envelope. Instead I paid $7 shipping to find it delivered in a huge box. What a waste...of packaging AND my money!
5,Great read,"This book does not present a history of the Hellenistic and Roman armies from every major battle to the next. It does do a very good job of explaining the changing world of command and control, equipment, tactics and doctrine. I love this book, I really recommend it."
2,What's with the repeated songs?,"Is there a reason why four of the songs are repeated? I think it's a waste of money to pay for seventeen songs when you're really only getting thirteen. Other than that, I like several of the songs; if there was more variety, instead of repitition, it would be a better CD."
1,I don't know what went wrong here,"I was introduced to kukicha when I purchasedHaiku Japanese Kukicha Twig, 100% Organic, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6), which was a tea experience unlike any I'd had before. So good! Then I fell in love with kukicha produced by Yamamotoyama, and so did my SO. Yum! A lot of their green tea is very, very good - we also love their genmaicha.This, however, tastes like coffee. It's unanimous: maybe I got a bad box that was contaminated when they processed tea after roasting coffee beans, but it tastes like weak but bitter coffee. Yuck!"
2,Not so much,"I don't know from macrobiotic diets and alkalinity, but I found Choice Twig Tea to taste of weak coffee, with a strong coffee aftertaste. It's not bad, it just doesn't taste like any other tea I've had. I'll finish the box, but I'll serve Darjeeling and China Oolong to guests."
5,Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for the Motorola I-275,"I have purchased 5 of these for my Motorola I-275's. I own two of these phones and have tried several different holsters. These holsters work the best for me for several reasons:-180 degree rotation-holds the phone securely-doesn't interfere with the phone's operation, speaker, mic, screen or keypad-sturdy and durableWhy have I purchased 5 holsters for two phones? Initially, I had purchased 2. After about a year, one phone was stolen with the holster attached. I have attempted to locate a replacement holster at EVERY SPRINT/NEXTEL store that I have happened to drive by in two different states (CA and NV). No one has had this style of holster in stock! So I ended up ordering 3 from my old stand-by, AMAZON, at a third of the price I paid for 1 holster over a year ago!Way to go AMAZON!"
1,Not Happy,The color that I wanted was purple. This looked purple when I ordered it the discription states that it is purple but when I received it the color was more a hot pink. Needless to say it is sitting in my drawer and will not be used unless for some reason the real purple case that I purchased later breaks.
3,uno orderhappy to find this product available,happy to find this product availableshipping was prompt but shipping package came open in transit and1/4 of shipment was lost
3,It's ok,"When ""The Hills"" began to lose its popularity, MTV decided to spin off a popular ""character"" (Lauren Conrad's BFF, Whitney Port) into her own dramality. This first half of its inaugural season was cool but never lived up to the excitement and intrigue of its west coast counterpart parent series. Honestly, I only stuck around due to a the Manhattan backdrop and the surprise guest appearance of Lauren Conrad herself. Other ""The Hills"" purists may find this series entertaining but, in my opinion, it never surpassed the original."
4,Some technical aspects are missing,"While whole book has enough details on plugins UI part, there is no information on third-party integration and plugin class loading issue is not covered enough (authors offer you to write your own jar class loader). Also missed a sample on PreferenceManager usage."
2,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THIS PRODUCT IS ADVERTISED. THE FACT THAT THE LINK VIEWED WHEN THE ALBUM IS CHOSEN DISPLAYS SEVENTEEN(17)TRACKS IS MISLEADING. THE ACTUAL PRODUCT THAT WAS SHIPPED TO ME ONLY CONTAINS FIFTEEN(15)TRACKS. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR TWO OTHER VOLUMES (OBG VOLS. 10 & 11), I'VE PURCHASED. BUYER BEWARE! THE ONLY REASON I RATED THIS SELLER WITH ANY STARS AT ALL, IS DUE TO MY OPINION THAT THE TRACKS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE ALBUM ARE EXCELLENT. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DOUBT I WILL TRUST THIS SELLER IN THE FUTURE."
5,Great!,Pencils were great. Great buy and I was very satisfied with the service and price. I didn't have any problems. I will buy from amazon again.
2,False advertisement STILL,"I was hopping Amazon has solved the false advertisement issue with these since it been a few months since the last review i saw about the artstick. No its still not there, and the pencils are not made in USA like they said, it's in Mexico and the tops are broken as well from the lack of cushions when shipped. The pencil outer shell is half chipped off or melted on mine and ? A few of them has a split down the middle on the side too...I don't know but it makes it seem cheap compared to the one made in USA one. Overall it good comapred to most colored pencils, but the quality had gone down. Very upset about it..."
2,All were broken!,"Although I love the color selection and the look of the product, each pencil breaks, must be re-sharpened and then breaks off again after just a short use."
2,Looking for a better option.,"As an industrial design student, I use markers and colored pencils frequently. I bought these as they were the most inclusive set I could find, and they seemed to be a good deal. Plus Prismacolor is the biggest name in the game. The problem I have is that the ""leads"" seem to be pre-broken at increments all the way down the pencil. When you sharpen a pencil to a point, the ""lead"" is broken just below that point so that when you apply pressure to paper, the point breaks off. I went through an entire yellow pencil in less than an hour just sharpening and breaking the point. I wish their was a better option to Prismacolor colored pencils, but I haven't found it yet."
1,No bonus Artstix,I received the color pencils in the tin. But there is no bonus Artstix. I think I am not the first one here that does not get them. They should change the name of the product so it would not mislead people anymore.
1,Do not buy!!!!,"Sure these pencils deliver a good color, but you're going to be buying a lot of them! The lead is broken on the inside, every time I try to sharpen them, I have to sharpen them down to a stump because the lead keeps breaking off in the sharpener. What a waste of money."
5,GREAT PRICE,The softer lead is easier to use and the colors blend well. The price was half the price of the local art store.
1,Caution: Check your colors + packaging !,"Everyone who has used these pencils, and even those who research them, will know that the soft cores are prone to breakage usually from handling.1) Check your packaging!This item was sent to me by Amazon in a box that allowed too much movement inside, and packingmaterial only on the bottom.2) Check your pencils!I found that 2 of the pencils were not from the set I ordered. They had different foil stampsand a few pencils were shorter ( which means they were Used).Make sure you get what you ordered, (I didn't get any Artstix in my package) It's not a debate about the usability of Artstix --just give me what I paid for!All in all, I felt like someone was trying to pull a fast one at my convenience. At least I only have to wait another week (even though I am a Prime member) and hopefully will get the right item packaged and shipped correctly, new and unused."
3,Great pencils!,These are great pencils. I would purchase them again but not thru Amazon. The product title and review stated Sanford Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencil Set 48/Tin with Two Bonus Artstix. The item came without the two Artstix. I contacted the seller and never got a reply. They also didn't look uniform. They still work great though. I would just pay the extra and buy them from an art supply store.
3,It could have been worse.,"I got the pencils on time, and compared the horror I went through ordering a different set of pencils, this was easy. However...1) There were no ""bonus artstixs"" in the package.2) Package allowed for way too much movement and breakage.3) All of the pencils were sharpened and as much as half an inch was missing from the pencils. (2 pencil tips were broken off from what looked like the sharpening)4) They looked used! There were small dents and tiny scratches in all of the pencils, whether this is from someone using or ""testing"" them or package movement, I'm not sure.All in all still great pencils, still work, but it's extremely disappointing to have to deal with such low quality from amazon."
4,Should be a five star,"But, I was disappointed when there was no true red, red scarlet or a red red of any color. I would think anything called a starter set would have the three primary colors. Aside from that, they arrived very fast, in great condition and I am thrilled with my purchase I am new to pencil color art and my instructor is great. I am loving this more than the paint media as I find it easier to travel with and so relaxing. My purchase would have and should have been five stars. But I didn't see red."
5,Albert Lee: Country Boy Instructional DVD,"What a goldmine!I think it would have been worth the cost, just to have a DVD of Albert playing his classic tunes.I think it would have also been worth the cost to have the 250+ pages of tabs.And I also think it would have been worth the cost to have this wonderful interview with a truly great, humble and likable musician talking about his craft.And they are all there, over 2 hours worth.Yes he plays most of the examples pretty quick, it seems like it is hard for him to play stuff slowed down and keep the original technique and timing. And this is definitely not an Albert Lee teaches note for note video (but there are tabs after all). These are not intro country lessons either, but there is a storehouse of information for anyone interested in taking the time to tap it."
3,"Amazing Guitarist, Poor Instructional Method","There is no doubt Albert is an amazing guitar player. The best feature of this DVD is his live performances. However, I found the instructional portion to be disappointing, if not odd. Albert doesn't really teach anything. Instead there is a gentleman sitting across from Albert asking question as Albert plays. The ""interviewer"" repeatedly asks Albert to slow it down, or explain what he is doing. It's like he has to drag information out of him. The interview/instruction method used here has a ""Spinal Tap"" feel to it. To me, it seemed as if Albert is almost a reluctant participant. I have been playing 30+ years, and am by no means a beginner; in my opinion this DVD has a poor instruction methodology. If you are a diehard Albert Lee fan then I recommend you purchase this, at least for the live performances. Otherwise your money would be better spent elsewhere."
5,Definitely Worth It,"A refreshing insight into the world of the deaf. Folling Theo's daily life with his deaf family and his new infatuation with another ""hearie"", I fell in love with this book. Kind of depressing at times because you're always wanting more than what the author will give you, but I suppose that's the trouble with good books. Definitely worth it."
2,Too much angst and sympathy,"I was looking forward to reading this book, because I know people who are deaf and have survived strokes. However, the characters in this story are very one-dimensional, the plot is thin, and even for a book written for young adults, the main character and his mother are much too angst-ridden.Lastly, I know very few people who are deaf who as DEPENDENT and ISOLATED as Palma, especially in contemporary society where we have so much technology to take advantage of (TTYs, closed captions, computers, etc. etc. etc.). Most people who are deaf lead very fulfilling lives in the company of both deaf and hearing people."
5,A striking story of a boy whose family is deaf,Jean Ferris' Of Sound Mind is a striking story of a boy whose family is deaf. He serves as interpreter and often as the semi-head of household in a silent world where his parents often struggle with hearing people and daily living challenges. Theo wants to go away to school - but how can he leave his dependent family? A striking story of coming of age and disability.
5,A Year Down Yonder: Not Far from A Long Way from Chicago,"Richard Peck does it again and does it better with A Year Down Yonder. It's hard to believe that anything could top the award winning A Long Way from Chicago, but this does. This time Mary Alice goes to live with Grandma Dowdel alone, and the results are hilarious. Mary, who was always more wise to the ways of her grandmother, learns a few new things about the town and her grandmother while managing to cause a stir herself. Once again, Grandma Dowdel's antics are both humorous and heart-warming, but it's her commentaries about the people of the town that make it a side-splitting riot. A Year Down Yonder is a must read."
4,A Year Down Yonder,"If you liked ""A Long Way From Chicago"" then you probably will like this funny story. When times get hard in 15 year old Mary Alices family, they send her to live with her grandmother. Here she learns to appriciate her grandmother. You will laugh out loud at Grandma Dowdles actions. If you are looking for a funny story to read then you have just found one."
5,Constant Laughter,"Oh my! this book is destined for a movie and i will be first in line. it is not just funny for kids, but i thought that it was the funniest book ive ever read. you will not be disappointed. also buy the audio version. the reader is awesome."
5,C'mon for A Year Down Yonder,"C'mon for A Year Down YonderThe book A Year Down Yonder by Richard Peck is very interesting, exciting and adventurous book with lots of detail. This book was specifically set in the early 1900's when they had just finished the depression and were having hard times recuperating. The family that this book is based on is one of the families that were not recuperating very fast. The members of the family are a boy, girl, mom and dad. The father had lost his job and the daughter had to move away and live with her grandma. The girl wasn't looking forward to staying with her grandma on a farm in the land of nowhere. The girl and her Grandma started to bond and that was when the book got good. I do not want to spoil the book for youso I will stop there. I really liked the book because it made me want to keep reading and that is why I gave it five stars."
4,Four Stars for A Year Down Yonder,I read the book A Year Down Yonder by Richard Peck. I gave this book four star. The book was very well written and was a lot of fun to read. The book is about a girl who has to go live with her grandmother until her family can bring in more money. During her stay she is part of many events. One of them were when her cat had a kitten. When the painter that comes to stay with them invites a woman over and a snake is found in the ceiling. They even have a turkey shooting. Don't worry they don't use real turkey's. Those are only some of the fun and exciting events that happen. So if you want to find out if Mary Alice's parents can get more money so they can bring her home and find out about more of the funny things that happen then pick up this book.
4,A Long Way from Chicago,His Granma Dowdel has rules Joey must follow. When she is ready to leave they must be ready too. Grandma Dowdel is taking a trip in a boat. I don't know what her plan is yet. I am reading this because we read A Year Down Yonder in social studies and I thought it was funny.
5,A tale you'll read over and over again,"What ever happened to the sweet old grandma that everyone hears about? If have a grandma that is beyond normality like I do, this book speaks your childhood. When two young children visit their grandma, no telling what surprises are in store for them. Granny carries a shotgun, hides a toothpick under her tongue to use as necessary (normally to make her more impressionable) and can scare the living daylights out of you. If the Big Bad Wolf ever messed with this Granny, he'll wish he'd never been born. There's fun and laughter on every page. Kids will definitely adore it."
2,A Year Down Yonder,"The book I read is called A Year Down Yonder by Richard Peck. It's about a girl name Mary Alice with her mom and her brother Joey-Joe. They are in a taxi going to a train station to meet their grandma there. When she gets to the train station she see her waiting for her. They both get on the train and leave.When they both get off the train they go to her grandma's house. As soon as they get there Mary has to go to school. But Mary doesn't like school because she was suspended and didn't want to go back. But now she has to.Later on in the story Grandma and Mary become best friends. Soon Mary gets maried.I gave this book a 2 beause I think it's dull, boring and I feel like falling asleep when I'm reading this book.End!"
1,Past country to (too) crude,"Purchasing the book for one of my children based on its having won the Newberry medal was a mistake.I decided to read it myself.The author certainly has an entertaining readable style. However, as a reader I felt I was gradually being dragged down a path that wasn't apparent at the beginning of the book. Sort of like having an acquaintance with brilliant storytelling skills, who carries off a progressively more off-color tale - by the end, you wish you hadn't heard the beginning.I stopped reading on page 106: where the postmistress suddenly runs naked down the stairs in front of the grandmother, teenaged girl and boy, etc.Not for me, and not for my kids."
2,Slow,"I paid extra for the fast shipping because I needed this book for a school project to write lesson plans. The extra amount was incredibly expensive, especially because it took just as long for it to arrive. This was my first time ordering from Amazon, so I didn't know to expect it to take a good or so for the items to arrive. Anyway, I ended up having to buy an expensive book from Target to get my project done and next time I will go with the slow shipping, as it takes the same amount of time anyway. Good news is, the book was in excellent condition and I will use it in a project within the next few weeks."
4,A year down yonder Book Review,"The year is 1937 and the depression has hit many familys including the family of Mary Alice. Her father has lost his job, his brother is forced to move out west to plant trees for the civilian corps and her parents are forced to move into a dumpy one bedroom apartment. Mary Alice walks off the train form chicago with two thoughts in her mind and two items in her hand.....The best things about this book are how it explains the life after the depression in a small country town, how her grandmother is so weird, also all the grandmothers schemes and how the writting was easy to understand. No really long paragraphs and no boring parts. This book was very dramatic, and great!I reccomend this book to ages 9- 13 it was really enjoyable.I hope you love the book!M.S. Rox"
5,book,My husband & I both enjoyed htis book and his others! He is a master story teller and easy to read! It arrived quickly and new!
3,A Year Down Yonder,This book was not particularly interesting to me. A teenage girl goes to her Grandma's house for the summer. The two of them do weird stuff like go pecan picking on halloween. The Grandmother goes on a turkey shoot amd shoots turkeys. I have to admit the Grandma was kind of funny. My taste tends to be science fiction and sports so others may very well enjoy this book.
5,A Year Down Yonder,"The girl, Mary Alice,goes to live with her grandma in Chicago in a little village. There are a lot of mysteries. The end is exciting!"
5,Very Good Summer/Vacation Read,"A Year Down Yonder is a very cute, nice, good story that is perfect to read during the summer or when you're on vacation. The story takes you through a year with a young girl during the war when she's sent to live with her grandmother. She learns alot about her grandmother and as a reader you'll learn to love both of them. I highly reccommend this book if you're looking for a relaxing, good-mood book. Enjoy!"
5,"Great book, but read it with your kid(s)","This is one of the best books I've read with my daughter in a long time. We read it out loud together (she's 9). I'm glad I did so, since I think there is a lot of information that would be confusing to kids nowadays. I think you need to have at least a sense of what the Depression era was like (I'm 40 and rely on my knowledge of history & stories from my parents & grandparents). But, we both loved this book! Now we need to read A Long Way From Chicago."
4,A Year Down Yonder,"I really liked this book, and I think both children and adult readers would also enjoy this book if they read it. My favorite part in the whole book is when those boys try to come and tear down Grandma Dowdel's privy, then the main boy trips over a string and grandma pours glue on his head! I think in some spots the author could have cut some parts out when it got kind of slow.My least favorite part was when Grandma and Mary Alice went over to Old Man Nyquist's house and he was pinned under some wood, I thought he was dead that's why that was my least favorite part. The author put to many words in it that I didn't know . I personally thought that a little more should have been written about Joey. I liked the way it ended with Mary Alice getting married in Grandma's house, and then right at the end they wrote who she was getting married to, Royce! I would surely recommend this to others, and I wish there was a sequel to this book."
2,"""A year down Yonder Review""","''A Year Down Yonder"" is a good book but, it has too much talking and not enough action. There are a lot of good parts in the book.. I like when grandma tries to get even with people in a non-grandma like way. The main characters in this book are Mary Alice, Grandma, and Bootsie the cat. I think that ''A year Down yonder"" is a good book but they should make more action in the book."
2,A Year Down Yonder,"A Year Down Yonder was a interesting book because it has a very good setting. It was written by Richard Peck. This is a maybe book. It has magnificent setting but it is a slow book. It is about a girl that has to live with her grandma because of the Depression . If you like slow, funny books this is the book you are looking for."
3,It was O.K,I read A Year Down Yonder. It's about a girl named MaryAlice and the setting is from Chicago to the countryside. That's where her Grandma Dowdel picked her up from the train. The only thing she had in her hand from the ride up was her cat Booties and a radio. Nobody liked her Grandma Dowdel. her Grandma was one of the people who got kicked out of school. But at the end it's nice because Rocye McNabbs gets married to MaryAlice.I give this three stars. It wasn't very intersting to me. I don't recommend this book to readers. I just like something with more detal. It was OK at some points but not very much.
3,"""A Year Down Yonder"" By Richard Peck","""A Year Down yonder"" Is a funny novel. Mary Alice is a high school student that comes from chicago to her grand mother's house in the south. There she gets picked on by the school bully. When Mary and her grandmother go out one day toget pecan for their pies grandma dowdel takes a trackto and runs into a tree and some pecans fell out. The moral of the story is to never give up reams thay might just come true. The reason fo living for her grandmother is because her parents split up and they decided to send her to her no orinary grandma dowdel. so now it is your turn to read ""A year down yonder"" to see what you think."
2,Amazing it's a Newbery Medal book,"Ok, I usually find that Newberry Medal books are amazing children literature. But A Year Down Yonder sure wasn't. I thought it was boring, strange story that didn't make me laugh like I thought it would. I think Richard Peck could have made a really great, funny, enjoyable story out of the plot that he had. But unfortunately he didn't. Me and my friend read this for school and we both didn't like it. This is what we said about it on ""The Books You Read for Reading Buddies"" poster. ""It was really hard to get into, and once we got into it, it was still boring."""
4,a great book!,"I thought was a great book full of adventure and comidy. I think it is greta for ages 13 and up. There is a slight stange part about a landy and a snake, but it is very funny.It's about this girl that has to move in with her grandma because of the depression.I would rekamend this book to anyone that like adventur/comidy books."
5,Terrific,"This is one of my favorite books. Laugh out loud funny with great dialog,Grandma Dowdel reminds me of my own wonderful Grandma, who raised a family of nine during the Great Depression in a small West Virginia town. They are so similar. I've read other books by Richard Peck but this one hits every target perfectly. Enjoy!!!"
4,A Year Down Yonder,"Fifteen year-old Mary Alice has been sent to live with her terrifying yet caring grandma. Mary Alice doesn't fit in in her grandma's ""Hick Town"" in Illinois, where she is known as the rich girl from Chicago. Being her grandma's sidekick, although it's interesting, isn't easy, either. For her grandma, the terror of the town, is known as being trigger-happy. But even though it's hard, being around her granmda never fails to make Mary Alice's life interesting and funny at times. And most surprising of all, Mary Alice learns that deep-down her grandma's heart is filled with caring and kindness. ""A Year Down Yonder"" is both a heartwarming and hilarious book.~*Caitlyn*~"
5,A Funny Grandma,"In a Year Down Yonder it is a very good and funny book besides the part in the chapter a Dangerous man. The reason why I didn't like the chapter is because a lady ran out of a house with nothing besides a snake on her.The reason why I thought it was funny was because Grandma is always pulling pranks on people in her town. She is also is kind of bossy in a nice way because grandma gets her way all the time so Mrs.Wilcox can stay in town and keep her house,and Grandma also is bossy in a nice way because she helps other people have a good life. Grandma also cares for other people in the inside. But on the outside she looks buff and mean. I totally recommend this book!!!:)"
5,Wonderful Sequel! Grandma Dowdel hasn't lost her touch!!,"The Depression has just ended and Mr. Dowdel has lost his job. They have to move to a small apartment and their son, Joey, who is seventeen is sent to the Civilian Conservation Corp. to plant trees. Their daughter, Mary Alice,who is 15, however is sent to live with Grandma Dowdel until the family has enough money. All the way from Chicago to Southern Illinois. Mary Alice's two touches to modern civilization are her cat, Bootsie and her radio. Living in Grandma Dowdels house is embarassing, yet you would never want to miss her crazy antics! The prequel told the story through Joey's eyes. Now you get to know how Mary Alice copes with it all. In all, A Year Down Yonder, is bigger, funnier and heaps better to the wonderful prequel!"
5,Great Book!,"Another strange time at Grandma Dowdell's. In A Year Down Yonder, a 15-year-old must survive her very strange time. This is a great book for ages 9+. It was really good. The detail is amazing, and you can really picture what's happening. I recomend this book for people who like, or love, to read."
4,Kelsay's Book Review,"It was 1937 and the Great Depression was over, but the recession had just begun. Thousands of men were out of a job and Mary Alice's father happened to be one of them. Times were hard on her family. They decided Mary Alice would ned to live with her Grandma Dowdel for a while. That little farm town was the last place she wanted to go but there was no other way. On her first day there her grandma sent her straight to school. Marcy Alice had never thought highly of her grandma. She was mean, cranky, stubborn, and old, but maybe there was more to her than Mary Alice knew yet. Before long it's Christmas and Mary Alice was cast as the virgin Mary for the nativity scene. By this time Mary Alice had come to realize that her grandma was very smart but crazy and it was that kind of respect that got them through."
2,No refills - not reusable,"I love the look of these mechanical pencils but have given up on this style because, for the life of me, I have not been able to figure out how to refill the lead once it runs out. I have taken these apart and tried inserting lead every which way, and it's just a huge hassle and I have not ever done it successfully. I think a mechanical pencil should be easily refillable and reusable, but these just end up in the landfills once the lead runs out. Not a good purchase."
5,Perfect for my kids and I love them too!,I bought these because my kids use them. They love them and the lead doesn't break as easy as other mechanical pencils. I just wish they were refillable but I have to shop around for the best deal.
3,every thing was great but...,every thing was great but the box of pencils was opened when the package arrived but all pencils were in tact
4,LUV THEM! <3 Always n' foreveer!,"First things strait, I never put 5 stars.Anyways, I love it. It came 1-2 days before the estimate date. Veery greeat! Luv It!The lead barely breaks. It's so strong because you don't push the eraser, you twist the cap thing where the lead come out. I didn't know that, but I'm glad it does. Because the lead barely breaks (: Yeea Buddy"
1,"Never, ever saw the lead","I bought a small pack (5 or 6) to give to my writers group. It's a good thing I tried one out first. I still haven't gotten sight of a lead, though I've twisted and twisted. I had one like this once and liked it, hence the purchase. Any ideas? I've read all the reviews, but still haven't seen any lead and I'm tired of twisting. How many twists does it take, 50?????"
2,I prefer the wood pencils to these...,"While these mechanical pencils have some advantages over a regular pencil, they are not what I would recommend. The reason behind this is that they are not refillable, and, with the ones I had, the lead would occasionally break inside the pencil, and I would have to throw the pencil away. The refillable pencils are better because they can be reused over and over, these have to be thrown out when they run out of lead. Another thing that I don't like about these is the method of lead advancement. To advance the lead, you have to twist the tip where the lead comes out. After using other mechanical pencils, I became used to pushing on the end for more lead, and got frustrated when this technique didn't work on these pencils. These pencils do have the advantage over regular wood pencils of not having to be sharpened, but I think I prefer wood pencils to these.Loggie-log-log-log"
2,Don't buy--you're only hurting the environment!,"The pencil does have smooth action and it is easy to hold. A simple twist allows one to retract the lead; good for then carrying it around in one's pocket. The lead does not break off as much as it does in some other mechanical pencils.But, and this is a big but, this pencil is NOT refillable. So, it will simply end up in a landfill. All that plastic and a long metal spring inside are just so much garbage--and consume resources and energy in the making. A regular lead pencil, made out of wood, is much more environmentally friendly. Other mechanical pencils, that are refillable, are a MUCH smarter buy-- both for reuse but also to spare the Earth.Anyone who buys this really is saying that they don't care about the environment!Shame on Papermate for making such a thing. Now, if they would make it refillable, I'd reconsider my rating!"
2,This pencil is okay,"I would not reccomend this pencil because it is a total waste of cash.The pencils are not refillable, and the lead breaks really easy. Nobody wants to have their one and only pencil that is not refillable run out of lead in class!The only choice for you then is to borrow one from a classmate, and usually they won't let you borrow one.I would not buy this pencil if I were you.Sure, they look pretty cool, but they are a waste of money."
5,Simply the best,"These mechanical pencils are the best I have ever used. They seem to hold up better than most mechanical pencils. Your typical mechanical pencil has a click the top to let out led way in which it works. With these pencils you twist the tip and I find this method much more sturdy and precise. I find the led breaks much less often due to the fact it has a twist adjustable tip and 0.7 led size. Not only is the quality of these pencils greater than that of ANY other led pencil I have used, they are extremely cheap at 12 for around $4 you are only paying about 33 cents per pencil, where as some mechanical pencils charge you $4+ for a single pencil. In my opinion these are by far the best mechanical pencil and you can't go wrong by buying them."
3,The writing tip wobbles,"My office got these, and I didn't like them. Something, whether it's that twist top or the ""cushion point system,"" makes it feel like the lead is loose. You know how sometimes with a standard pencil the lead breaks off below the level of the wood but doesn't fall out, and you can still write with it but it feels a bit loose and wobbly? That's what these things are like for me, all the time. I asked our office supply manager to switch to a different kind of pencil.On the plus side, the twist-top in place of a push-the-eraser click system means you can't accidentally advance the lead when you erase, which is nice, and the lead doesn't actually break that often, even though it feels disturbingly loose when writing. Also, kudos to those who have pointed out that these can in fact be refilled, with a little ingenuity."
3,"Works well, but don't like cushioned tip","Love everything about it but the annoying cushioned tip. You have to press down since it's a pencil so it has a ""mushy"" feel as you write. Great eraser."
4,Pencil for Rite in the Rain,"While these may not be the world's best mechanical pencil, they work great a field pencils. They are great for Rite in the Rain paper - can get wet. You can even use them with DuraRite paper and take then underwater. You don't have to worry about salt killing them because they are cheap and you don't need a pencil sharpener.Wood pencils often get soft in the water."
2,Ok,This led pencil does not have a push to advance lead and the lead. Does not fall out if u push it all the way bu it does come with lead
3,Not as good as store-bought.,"I bought a batch of these at an office supply store a few years back and loved them. I kept losing my high-end mechanical pencils, so I started buying cheap ones that I wasn't worried about losing. I tried many brands, and these are the best disposable pencils I have found. The erasers don't dry out or leave smudges like some other low-end pencils. To advance the lead, you twist the bezel at the bottom, instead of clicking the top like some disposable mechanical pencils.My gripe is this: about 75% of the pencils in the Amazon order (I bought 60 pencils) have very hard-to-twist bezels. But the rest of them are fine, so I think the manufacturing quality has gone down."
3,The last 2 boxes were not very good,"The first couple of boxes I bought of these pencils were very good. They were my and my son's favorite cheap mechanical pencils. The last 2 boxes, however, were a disappointment. Last night, a lead kept retreating back up the barrel, even when it's not being used (poised; stopped). And there were at least 6 pencils that just didn't work or stopped working (lead won't advance at all) after a week or 2 of light use. I'm looking for a different set/box now."
3,Not for Me,"I first bought a package of these from Walgreen's. I like the design and large eraser. Writing with this pencil is smooth and the lead isn't too light or too dark. The eraser is soft and reliable. However, if you are someone who uses a lot of pressure to push down on the paper I wouldn't recommend. When you press down a little too hard the lead goes back into the barrel. I think it's due to the twist out design. I found that when I wrote, the lead was bobbing in and out. Pretty annoying."
4,Mechanical Pencil,My hometown recycle center will not allow me to place the pencils when done into recycling. That's my only complaint. These pencils are terrific.
1,Painful of Heart,"I have very eclectic tastes, am easy to please and I thought I would never trash an album, but AVOID THIS CD AT ALL COSTS!!! The problem is with the Menotti ""Violin Concerto"". Throughout the performance one can hear someone grunting and moaning in the background. It could be the soloist. Maybe the conductor. It is a horrible distraction. The other two works on the CD are fine: Randall Thompson the ""Peaceable Kingdom"" and David Diamond ""Rounds for String Orchestra"". However all these works are available on other CDs. For example, there is a nice recording of the ""Rounds"" on the Delos Label Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony"
2,"too many errors, unprofessional","This book does have a lot of good info. However, the author did a very unprofessional job in that there are just too many errors in the code samples; it seems each time I try any of the more complex hacks, the code samples are riddled with syntax errors to the point where instead of focussing attention on learning more about baseball stats, I have to focus on debugging details.If you are both an expert in the R program and are fluent in MySQL, you can work around the bulk of this without wasting too much time. However, if lack either of these skills, you will find this book nightmarish IMO. The small amount of info the author gives in R, for example, is not nearly enough to troubleshoot all the errors.It's too bad - this could be an excellent book if the author hadn't been so lazy about getting the details right."
4,Good explanations,"You have to be a programmer to do much with the code in this book. There is no robust system to download you can just run. However, it goes beyond programming and has a lot of explanations of advanced baseball statistics. Mostly historical statistics such as ""Was Barry Bond's better then Babe Ruth and how do we use statistics to tell?"". The world could stand to have a few more books involving baseball and programming."
1,Total Disapppointment,"I have tried just a couple of the Hacks in the beginning portion of this book (#11, #14) and nothing has worked as displayed in the book. I have followed everything word for word, read the errata, double-checked everything over and over. The objectives of the book are great, they just don't work in the real world."
1,Too expensive,I am buying these candles for 9.99 or less in Marshalls. I buy other articles in Amazon but this is one item too expensive to buy here
1,Yankee Candle,Found out a few days before Christmas that this item was either lost or destroyed in shipment. Was very disappointed.
1,I'm a teacher and I HATE candles.,"This item should be removed from the teacher want list, along with all artificially scented bath items. Burt's Bees is great, but I promptly throw away items like this and smelly bath items that send my allergies through the roof!"
4,Smells wonderful!,I got this as a Christmas present for someone who loves Yankee Candles and I think she'll love this one as well! The scent is absolutely heavenly and makes you hungry for some Christmas cookies!
1,What a waste of time and money!,"I got this movie becasue I liked Quentin Taratino's previous success in ""Pulp Fiction"". This is nothing like it and does not show the same inventive flow. It is cartoonish, dull, not exciting, boring, full of insipid and umemotional violence and generally not worth wasting time and money to see.I am glad I saw this, however, so I won't waste time and money on KB2."
1,Why was this movie ever made?!,"This was probably the worst movie ever made. First off, I will say that I like Lucy Liu as an actress, but this movie degraded her acting prowess. Uma Thurman was sadly disappointing. You can find better acting in a children's theatre than in this movie. Also, there is such a lack of realism. Maybe that was what Tarantino was after, but the movie would have been better if it focused more on the plot and storyline and less on the gallons of fake blood that exploded from severed limbs. I won't even mention the music, of which made me cringe everytime I listened to it. If you do like non-realistic depiction and bad acting, then this is the movie for you. Rent it before you buy it."
1,Not worth the film it was printed on,"""Kill Bill"" absolutely sucked! And this is coming from someone who loved ""Pulp Fiction"". Please don't waste your precious time and money on it.It was beyond boring and the acting was embarassingly bad.I feel sorry for Tarantino. ""Kill Bill"" seems like a desparate attempt to recapture the intensity he had with ""Pulp Fiction"" but with this one he failed miserably."
2,Faking it is just too easy,"I cannot understand all the positive ratings. I watched the European dvd last night and have just two comments.1. The Western actors tried to hard to make their studied Japanese lines sound like real Japanese. I speak Japanese myself, the intonation was off and some of the lines sounded ridiculous!2. The fight scenes were miserable. Do I need to say more? They should have used Michelle Yeoh instead of Lucy Liu for example. Ballet and sword fighting are two totally different things.Yes there were some nice scenes in this movie that why I give it two stars, but for me it was irritating most of the time."
1,Absolute Wubbish.,"This film is very violent. Since it is a two parter, I should have perhaps waited perhaps untill the second part came out to decide on a grade. However, if the second part ends with '''The Bride'' being revealed as actually a man, then I will give it ten stars. Absolute Wubbish!"
2,A Great B Movie Correlates to an Average Movie,"Apart from the great cinematography, superb soundtrack, and thoroughly entertaining, beautifully romanticisized violence, this movie is just a B movie with a finely polished veneer. To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth."
1,Stupid.,"Wow, this movie sucks. Ok, so Tarantino has a non-chronological, attempted mind-bending style. But ~think~ people, what REALLY makes this so great? Right; Nothing. I'll stick with much better movies such as Fight Club (a true masterpiece...), Gladiator, Tears of the Sun, etc. Even Pirates of the Caribbean makes this movie look lame. (ohmygod, did I just say that about a Disney movie???)"
3,Just A'iight!,"I borrowed this from a friend, my buddy Bobby Asslong, who is normally very keen in his reviews and referrals. But he missed the mark with this one. He called it a true classic, with the markings of an award winner. I call it, a bloody awful, overrated Shanghai extravaganza. Not bad, but certainly not as good as it was hyped.I would recommend renting before you buy. Maybe my friend, Mr. Asslong would be willing to lend you his copy.MC White said: Just a'iiight!"
5,Violence and revenge made slick and fun,"Kill Bill is stylistic art, to be appreciated subjectively. Expect to be entertained, but also expect to be piqued. It has no real plot, but the story works anyway. I hate gratuitous violence, I refuse to watch slasher movies, and I don't enjoy true crime or martial art films. It's difficult to explain the appeal of this uncompromising, irredeemable revenge film, but I can say that it touched some primitive, atavistic part of my emotions (humans have a degree of bloodlust built into their genes, necessary for the survival of our ancestors, which, ironically, may be the undoing of us now), without making me feel dirty or used when I left the theater. Tarantino also doesn't throw in the usual bunch of moralistic, hypocritical baggage that comes with other violent movies. There's no vigilanteism, no heroism, no phony honor system, no blind loyalties, and innocent people are left alone. Anyway, Kill Bill is as fun as murder and mayhem gets."
2,Disappointing Effort,"I am very disapointed in this film. I have enjoyed some of Tarantino's other films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Jackie Brown"". However, this movie was a let down. I understand what he was trying to do with the violence and the blood splurting out or every wond. It seemed he was trying to make a real life movie resemeling Japanese animation. It may do that is some slight ways, but the plot and the writing are terrible. I do not have any desire to see ""Kill Bill 2"". I also find it funny that people think that this movie was originally made with the idea of making two movies and that a sequil was required due to the success of the first Kill Bill. The truth is that this series of movies was only suppose to be one complete movie. I am not sure if it was mere greed of the belief that people would not sit through the entire length of both movies combined, but Tarantino decide to cut the movie in half and try and make twice the money."
3,Jap,"Does everyone out there speak Japanese? Because I don't so I didn't get half the movie! OH, it's the fighting scene that we are only suppose to get out of this thing."
2,"OOZING WITH STYLE, BUT LACKING IN SUBSTANCE","The soundtrack though is a fabulous treat. And so is Ms. Therman. The fighting finale would match, or beat, the 'Burly Brawl' from Matrix Reloaded. But sadly that's about all going for the movie.Sure, it's a typical Tarantino visual feast with delicious camera shots from wicked angles. And yes, as a martial arts movie it may hang with the top of the tops (was it just me or did anyone notice ""Crouching Tiger"" influences too?)But his 4th film nowhere near matches the sheer class of Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction. Once the hype has faded, I am sure people'll realise how mediocre this film really is, stylish maybe, original somewhat, but a boring script that shows little direction.What's most worrisome is that this tripe should be long enough to be cut into two bits. Perhaps the stuff that cults are made of, but a disappointing movie overall. One can only hope that the second part is where it's at."
2,Not a patch on the original drama,"I give Tarantino his props for creating his own genre of blood splashed action but he has absolutely no idea when it comes to paying homage to the original kung fu and samurai films that he claims to love. KILL BILL is well-crafted but overlong and it lacks the passion and sense of duty and honor that make the true HK and Japanese so-called ""chop-suey"" flicks so well regarded. Not a bad way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon but hardly worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as some of the true HK classics."
1,Taratino as always over-did it. OVERKILL.,"Once again another ""Good Movie"" According to Taratino, The movie is over kill, and the very ugly uma thurman, movie really is overkill in the action sequences, in the violence, in the acting, pretty bad movie. I hate ""catchy"" hip flicks."
2,Big Budget Gorefest,"Basically, it's a B-movie with a huge budget. If you like sensational violence with severed limbs and hot girls killing each other; then you'll probably enjoy the flick. I was bored by this movie and struggled to make it to the end.I've never before seen a movie where I kept thinking to myself ""What a waste of money?"" so much. Tarantino could have made the same movie with 1/4 the budget and unknown actors. Then maybe he would have further developed the plot."
1,Mind-Numbing Garbage,"I went to see Kill Bill in the middle of a mostly mind-numbing convention. The movie did nothing to improve my mood. The level of violence--implied, threatened, and realized--overwhelms what could have been an interesting storyline. This is commercial exploitation at its schlockiest--before one can understand Kill Bill 1, one needs to see Kill Bill 2, where supposedly all questions will be answered (Who is the Bride? How did she become an assassin? Why did someone want to kill her? Why did they pick her wedding in the middle of Nowhere, Texas? Who is Bill, anyway?). I come out of few movies wishing I hadn't wasted my time, but this is one of them. Skip the DVD and find something good, like Master and Commander."
5,love it,"kill bill is one of that classics that everyone should have, uma thurman is an epic actress and beauty one and tarantino as always make nice movies and bizarries ones hahaha xD"
2,Video Game,This movie is basically a non-interactive video game. Lucy Lui plays the boss of the game. It could've been a lot better with just a little more thought and a lot less stupid violence.
5,Great Movie,"What a great movie. Great fight scenes. Even a little anime in it. Uma thurman plays a woman who wants revenge for getting beat up, betrade, and a little bullet in the head. Making a hit list and going after the people. The last one on the list is bill (of course). The movie basically explains why she's after him, who the people who beat her up are, and how she kills the people she's after. This movie is definately a must have for any fan on martial arts, revenge, and bloddy movies."
3,it has moments,"Quentin Tarentino is One of those Directors you either feel is very Creative or you feel He is very Over-Indulgent&this Film is a combination of both. Uma THruman is His Modern Day Pam Grier getting down. I dug the fight scenes&the Music worked,but some things sorta made the film lag in spots.interesting but some things could have been trimmed out. still Tarentino will have you talking one way or the other."
3,Hmmm.......,"The first 20 min was just great!!!! Good action, but after that the movie was so rare, and with chapters, and couldnt understant nothing after that.The acting is good ! but the movie is weard :$."
3,It was Alright,It was ok but the cartoons were annoying and the blood was just unbelievable to the point that you ask your self a human body contains that much blood??
3,Have a little patience...,"Okay, it's a decent movie, and yes I'd like to own it but why would you buy this release. Have a little patience because this is a cash grab no different then splitting the movie in 2 for it's theatrical release. Wait until after Vol. 2 has been put out and but the big box set you know is on the way with both Vol. 1 and 2 and likely all sorts of extras. Shame on Tarantino for breaking this movie into 2 pieces in the first place, if legions of Hollywood guppies will sit through 3 hour movies like Dances with Wolves or Titanic surely Tarantino fan's would have sat through this film in it's entirety."
3,A lot of oomph and a lot of Quentin,"Kill Bill, Volume 1 started was filled with a lot of energy, and Quentin Tarantino, seeing how it was his movie, definitely left his 'better' marks on it. However, I could not fully get into the movie. I know that Kill Bill is a homage to old Asian fighting movies, and spaghetti westerns, and in that light the movie flows, but from an average viewer standpoint who probably has not seen too many of those, it just is a lot of fighting with a lot, and a lot, of fake overdone bloody scenes. Now, if you like Quentin then you will probably like this movie, because it is done in a very creative, yet still Quentin style. I guess, the movie overall is okay, especially since they had the time to put in a creative anime sequence, but I still did not think too highly of the movie overall."
3,"Generally a good flick, but somewhat disapointing","I have seen most of Quentin Tarantino's films, and can appreciate his twisted, artistic way of directing. I love the films Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, both 2 great cult-classics. I thought this movie would be another classic but i was let down.I love a good, gory film, but i think he went a bit overboard with all the decapitation, and limbs getting knocked off left, right, and center. Overall it had the same Quentin Tarantino style humour, and twisted characters. If you injoyed Bruce Lee type films this movie is for you, but if you were looking for another Reservoir Dogs, or Pulp Fiction, you might be disapointed."
3,"good movie, but ...","It doesn't look like the DVD will have that much stuff on it. A movie this big would have to have tons of extra footage and making of material. So they would naturally wait to make this material a third disc when the whole set is released at once. I'll upgrade my home equipment for that one, but I think I'll sit out this one."
2,Trite Bloodbath,"I found this movie highly predictable and way more violent than any of the other movies. .The only really good moments are when they're playing a good piece of obscure music... ie, the intro song ""Bang Bang"" sung by Nancy Sinatra.My favorite moment was when the flute music plays at the end. (not a spoiler) I kept thinking what Japanese song this was and then I had the strange idea it could be Zamfir, but thought if it was it would be kind of a geeky joke between Tarentino and the few people who actually remember those tv ads for the panflute recordings... And by jove... the song is called ""the Lost shepherd"" performed by Zamfir. ;)If nothing else, I'll get a nice soundtrack of music from this movie. That's a guarantee with Tarentino movies. :D~L~ who's giving her copy of Kill Bill to her brother"
5,"REVENGE BABY, YAH!!!","Alot of people criticize this movie for being too violent when they haven't even seen it. If you are a true lover of cinema you will appreciate this film. Yes there's lots of blood, gore and violence but if you give it a chance you will see that it is all so over the top, it is almost cartoonish and you won't take it so seriously.If you have seen it and aren't going to watch the vol.2 because you think it is more of the same, you will be pleasantly surprised with a diologue rich, fraction of the violence, well completed story of revenge. So if you have made it through vol.1, treat yourself to vol.2 you will be glad you did!"
4,a bloody movie,kill bill vol.1 is better than i thought it would be. this film was way better than volume 2. tarantino did a vary good job on this movie. this is the most violent movie i have ever seen.
5,"Terrific, Important Film","Uma Thurman's performance is sublime. Philosophically and emotionally complex with no pandering and tons of po-mo, pop cultural fun. A huge leap forward for complex portrayals of women on screen. Loved it."
3,HOLLYWOOD Tarantino??,"Great movie I have to say, paying respect to crazy asian cinema. My only gripe is Uma Therman being in the movie. I would have like to see Quinten dig up and unknown actor or maybe some B movie or expoitation actress. And although I like Lucy Lu I can think of a hundred different asian actresses that would have fit the role better. ANyway, great movie! If you like this movie check out any movie by Takashi Miike like: Iche the Killer, Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive 2, Dead or Alive Final, Audition, Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl.... any one of these movies makes KILL BILL look like a Walt Disney film!!"
2,Unrealistic gratuitous violence,"This is about what we have come to expect from Mr. Tarantino. If you are a fan of Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one as well. If you are not familiar with his work, then this may be the least offensive you might start with. The gore is mostly phoney but still prevalent. Ms. Thurman is an attractive young lady, no doubt. But her attractiveness quickly disappears in the gratuitous mayhem and glorrification of blood revenge. The fight scenes are pure martial arts fantasy of the cheesiest variety and are only props for additional blood-spurting ""entertainment."" There seems to be little of value in this one but Tarantino fans are die-hard fans and this one is classic Tarantino."
5,Great movie,Extreme violence is not something that is usually appealing to me but Tarantino's movies give you enough space between reality and fiction to make it interesting and you don't recognize the gore. The music in this movie is perfect as in all of his movies. He is an extremely creative director and this movie is a classic in my opinion. Volume 2 is as good or maybe even a little better.
5,Classic,"Wow! Quentin Tarrantino makes another interesting film with this story about an ex-assassin who must return to her profession to take revenge on the people who ruined her wedding and killed her unborn child. Uma Thurman does a great job as 'the Bride' as she goes on to kill the first two people on her hit list (the rest of the hit list is taken care of in Volume 2 of this film) There are many memorable scenes in this film, especially when O-Ren Ishii punishes a crime boss for making fun of her heritage, or the Bride taking on the Crazy 88's. One hell of a film!"
3,slightly dissapointing,"this movie , though good, is probably not as good as you hope. The action is exciting, but not very realistic, a cartoonish gore. The movie has a sense of humor that fits well, but overall just fails to make the movie a star. the sequel however is a real winner and you must see this one first."
1,"K--- the Director, Please!","What are you people smoking? This movie had nothing; it just plain stunk. Okay, Pulp Fiction was decent in a quirky way, but is that all this director can do? Enough with the quirk, give me some acting, a good story, and believable characters. I made it only half through this nonsense. The good news I won't have to bore myself with Kill Bill 2."
1,Trite Pretense in Action,"I liked Tarantino's Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction.I rented this because it starred Uma Thurman and I love samurai movies.Too bad this and part 2 are PRETENTIOUS trash. As I watched some scenes unfold, I was actually embarassed for Quentin."
2,"It`s Tarantino So It`s Good, Right??","(...) Basically, Uma Thurman`s character just wants to ""Kill Bill"". And this movie is pretty much a staightforward sequence of well-directed and cleverly made action scenes with enough blood and violence to deserve cult status and some appeal. Mix some black humour, cultural and cinematic references, technical gimmicks, a cool soundtrack and even an anime sequence and you will have ""Kill Bill"". What seems to be lacking is a decent and original plot, since this is nothing more than a typical revenge story about a vitimized and angry tough woman. Overall, this is flashy and disposable entertainment that doesn`t care to provide much food for thought. Not that it is a bad thing, but Tarantino has done better and a movie like this doesn`t deserve all the praise it got.Disappointing."
1,Proof that popularity has nothing to do with quality,"What a waste of time, money, air, breath, fake blood, stunt men, wirework, etc, etc, ad nauseam (and there was a lot of that). This is just crap. It doesn't even get any better on double speed when they all sound like Chip and Dale.Tarantino is the nerdy kid that got picked on at school all grown up and now he's laughing as he takes his vengeance out on you the viewer.Watch anything else, for your own sake, please. I mean that, anything. Well, maybe not 'Battlefield Earth' but even then it's a toss up."
2,The mother of gore movies,Much to violent. This is a sick glorification of both untrammeled and pointless killing and maiming. The picture ought to be banned. Even I myself felt gloomy and irritable the next day.
2,WHY?,"""Why am I watching this?"" That's never a good sign, when you ask yourself that 20 minutes into a movie. What we have here is plenty of bloody action, but no plot, and intentionally poor dialogue. Artfully staged mortal combats, but no reason to care about the main character. Sure, she was shot in the head on her wedding day. But why? And by whom? Who is she anyway? Why should I even care? And then I find out I need to sit through a second movie just to find out why? Are you kidding me? It was all I could do to get through this one. Pulp Fiction this is not. Unfortunately."
2,Snoozy,"Snoozy.Like watching Kabuki theatre, or Noh...it is that dull, and unless you have the same visual and cinematic archeology, you never ""get"" it. I feel like Homer Simpson watching Twin Peaks. Not only do ""[y]ou never forget that Kill Bill is an exercise in genre-sampling,"" you get beaten over the head with and told you are a dummy because you don't know what the film is referring to.The story follows a woman who goes on a rampage of revenge. Smarfart cineophiles get their eyeballs stroked like tools with nearly every shot.The mundane and exotic are contrasted so starkly you begin to think the film is actually being shot in black and white and you are simply graphemic."
2,slice and dice volume I,"This is a very graphic blood and guts fight movieusing sharp edged instruments.I don't like Quentin Tarantino (Rating R) very much after having seen a number of his movies:mostly because he is very very good atgrossing me out. A younger me would have hid his head at this movie; the older me says he hopes no stuntmen/ extras were hurt doing this.I'd buy shares in his company, because people are going to line upfor these movies. I just don't have to like his product or the manbehind it."
3,A nice little genre play....,"I don't think I'll ever consider this to be a great film or anything, however Tarantino has a great visual style and so on."
5,The Ultimate Tribute!!!,"This film is so entertaining and so cool, a great tribute to 70's Westerns and Martial Arts films. Just watching Uma Thurman in her yellow outfit similar to Bruce Lee's in his unfinished project ""The Game of Death"" has to bring back memories for Martial Arts movie fans everywhere.The fight things are spectacular, the Japanise anime complements the movie very well, the music is great,even the dialogues are fun to watch, an unusual thing for action movies these days. You can even know that the actors are having a good time playing their roles.Chapter Five called ""Showdown at House of Blue Leaves"" in which The Bride stalks O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu)with the 5,6,7,8's music playing in the background(fun music)and then gets in a sword fight with her gang in order to get to her is the best action sequence I have seen in years. It's fast paced, violent, intense, cartoonish, fun, just great!!.This is not a must see, It's a MUST OWN for every action fan."
4,Style and Gore,"Quentin Tarantino is insane - But definately my kind of insane. This movie has moments that shine like some of Quentin's best work, but the other parts fall short of the perfection of Pulp Fiction. I understand that you cannot compare a masterpiece to something that is just a fine piece of film making, like Kill Bill is. It's just the unbeliveable gore that is shocking. Not only does the spraying blood start to become humorish (which had to be the intention), it also is distracting from this outstanding thriller. This is not something, the faint of heart should watch, but for those thrill seekers out there...Quentin wants to take you for a ride. I cannot wait for Vol 2."
2,Miramax Sucks!,"I loved this movie, okay, let me get that out of the way. But they are such sneaks. In order to get more money from the general public, they will be releasing several versions of both volumes once they are all on DVD. I have seen the volume one DVD and it had the worst features. Don't waste your money on this and wait until the ultimate version comes out."
3,I DON'T WANT TO WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me get this out of the way before people start thinking that I hated the movie. I didn't hate the movie. I loved the movie. I just thought that since we can enjoy a 3 hour movie like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter in the theater, we can enjoy Kill Bill for 3 hours. I would have done it, and I'm sure alot of people would have done it. But the fact that we have to wait 4 months to see the rest of the movie sucks. Okay, The Matrix Reloaded pulled it off with giving us 2 hours and 18 minutes of movie and then saying ""TO BE CONCLUDED"", but Kill Biil, Vol. 1 was only 1 hour and 50 minutes and left us with a major cliffhanger wanting more. COME ON! I just hope that Miramax will release the movie as a whole when it comes out on DVD because buying two different halves will be a waste of money. I'd rather get one long movie in one package then spend 40 bucks on one movie. Anyway, go out and see Kill Bill It is really good!"
5,At last not another jerry bruckheimer piece of crap,"Since reservoir dogs quentin tarantino can still blow us away with something original and fresh.kill bill is funny fast and bloody as hell with obvious influence from manga classics such as ninja scroll.Great soundtrack, great cast and great directing from a man that always thinks out side the box."
4,Over the top genre collision,"What makes this film work is the fact this it IS an over the top genre collision. Non-Stop action from beginning to end, with the violence pushed to unbelievable, making it easier to take and making this BBBBad in the very good sense of American slang.QT barrowed from the best, turned it on its ear and made something very new and refreshing out of it!"
2,"The family liked it, but...","although i'm a fan of most of q. tarintino's work, well, this one didn't do much for me. This was a very stylistic movie, some very nice cinematography, and almost no plot. the violence was extreme, but also stylized and came off kind of cartoonish.i'm told if you were a fan of those cheesy karate movies, you'd appreciate this movie more. i don't know. i'd rather have a plot for the movies i see."
3,Tarantino's Hang Em High,"HANG EM HIGH is the 1968 Western in which Clint Eastwood's character is strung up but doesn't die. He spends the rest of the film killing the men who hanged him. That is KILL BILL VOL 1, sort of. But HANG EM HIGH has none of the following: fake blood pumped through firehoses, a cartoon, an extensive close-up of a foot, a black and white segment for no apparent reason, cool music, and subtitles. What KILL BILL shares with HANG EM HIGH is comic book dialog and comic book intellect. It's good teenage fun, if you can get past the pantloads of tricks. And Uma Thurman is a tremendous physical actor. For me, good trash maxes out at three stars; four stars is for good art; five for great art. Recommended."
4,Killer Cast,"What's not to like about a film's credentials like Uma Thurman, David Caradine, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, and... If you're a fan of comic books, or graphic novel's, and/or G.N.'s translated into film(like the Batman movies, Sin City, or ""V"" for Vendetta, etc.), this is one for you! Tarantino's filmmaking style lends itself well to this ""animated adult comic book"" style! Uma does a typically powerful roll, and well cast as a modern chick superhero with today's C.G.I. realism! Her sly""I know what you're thinking"" smile is perfectly cast! A truly fun, sexy, action adventure, trip into the imagination. A visual Feast! Sit down to it and expect to have a good time, without any other motivations!"
3,limp,"this is suppose to be QTs attempt at the martial arts vengeance movie. it is stylish and extremely bloody. but it lacks the dialogue and the street grit of pulp fiction. there is a great opening scene cat fight but the movie wanders afterwards. the characters do not seem real, more cartoonish than actual people. there are some of the old QT movie cliches that you will recognize, but it seems a little outdated now. the fighting is lacking simply because you are dealing with amateurs, not bruce lee. the older QT gets, the more he seems to rely on more blood and guts, less story and humor. QT got lucky with pulp fiction and has yet to match the old magic."
3,Child's play for Uma Thurman makes Jack a bored boy.,"First of all, I don't think it's fair that a woman should be able to 'effortlessly' wield so much power. If there is no peril in the fight, then there is no glory in the triumpth.Secondly, the name of the film gives away the ending, which is stuipid. No one likes forgone conclusions, that's why everyone hated Titanic. ..."
4,Great Movie But Not Without It's Flaws,"Quentin tarantino has been making some very twisted and horrible films in his past, Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, but it looks like he's making an attempt to REDEEM himself!this time he made his first great movie!Only problems with this movie are-it's out of order-they bleep out the heros name - BAD MOVE, it's annoying-too much anime in the O-ren scene-the MUSIC! the 5678's, the music from one of hip-hops worst producers ""the RZA"", tarantino needs to open his eyes and realize this is the 21st century, not the 1970's!"
1,Gross and Stupid,"My husband and I are huge martial arts fans, but this is aweful. Blood and violence everywhere too the extreme that it was pointless. We didn't even finish watching it. Obviously we'll be skipping Vol 2. And that jumping forward and backward in time just gets confusing."
1,psychopathic movies,All I can say is it is amazing how people are deluded into believing this is some kind of art form . When it is only the product of a daranged mind whose sole purpose is to pollute society and our young peoples' minds .You can pontificate all you want about how he is taking different styles and re-arranging it or whatever . Maybe he is doing that but it doesn't take a couple of hours to put those ideas together into a script . That's not genius . What is genius is how he has fooled thousands of people . I have seen him on American Idol as sitting judge . Can't put two coherent sentences together . Get another hobby people .
1,Sickness as art,"When hollywood doesn't know how to capture an audience with anything intelligent or unique, they can always resort to the cheapest and easiest trick in the book. Just shock the audience. Show them something more repulsive or twisted than they've seen before. It's easy to do, and it always buys a few good reviews from people who think anything that shocks them must be art.The fight scenes in this movie are less imaginative than what you can see at home in Alias or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but they add ridiculous amounts of blood to please the small minded serial killer wannabes out there. No realism - just characters that never go into shock or bleed to death. This movie carries on Hollywood's seeming goal of desensitizing the public to any kind of atrocity - perhaps to help make the real atrocities in the world more pallatable for us. Don't see this film. I did, and it's a memory I wish I could erase."
1,Kill Bill,I have not walked out on a movie in many years. But 20 minutes into this movie I left. I do not believe in censorship but this was pure crap and a waste of time to show. I would like to meet the people that gave this a 4 or 5 star. There are so many good movies out there that get left behind - and this is not one of them!
5,"Lacking in bonus features, but still stellar!!","I saw Kill Bill twice in the theater and could not wait for it to come out on DVD, packed with bonus features. Alas, one commentary and some trailers. Sigh...This film is still an awesome tale of revenge, with Uma Thurman as the Bride, who awakens from a coma and begins visciously and methodically taking out her former co-DiVAS. The anime sequence, telling us of the childhood suffering of O-ren Ishii is even more spectacular than in the theater! The special effects are top-notch, even the sounds of the swords, and are more cartoonish than gory. It is truly the little things that make this a unique film, including a soundtrack produced by the RZA.I can't wait to see the second installment, hopefully it gets a better DVD treatment when the time comes."
3,good...,"This film was good...although this feels like it should have been a part 2 (tarantino I believe already had volume 2 partly done and partly thought out). I don't know why but this film feels slightly rushed.Bascially you have a woman, who was going to get married but got brutally battered and left for dead by a bunch of assains. Waking up after a 4 year coma she vows revenge. The music in this movie was good (classic stuff). the hanzo sword scenes weren't bad but not as good as part 2. You have a little comedy, a little sass, and a lot of attitude. I read a few reviews were people misread the animation scene (cause there is one and it surprised me cause you don't expect it in a film). Anyway some were saying it was porn. There was no sex, no talk of sex, and no sounds of it. So how can someone see it that way is a mystery. My only guess is those people didn't actually see the whole film (you know how some are, they see 2 seconds of a one hour film and want to give a review)."
3,Japanese Release Was Better,"This movie came out while I was living in Japan, so I happened to see it in a theater over there. I was very impressed with the story and the overall quality of the movie. Definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's better works.Then, a year later, I was visiting America and saw the American release. I couldn't believe how much they butchered it! They edited it so much to avoid the NC-17 rating that it ruined the overall quality. The fight scene against the Crazy 88's was spectacular, but they changed it to black and white and cut out the messiest parts. Other particularly gruesome parts were edited too. Even the amputation of Sophie's arm was cut. (No pun intended :P )I love the Kill Bill movies, but I will never purchase the hacked-up American release. The unedited Japanese version, done exactly the way Quentin intended it to be, is all I care to see."
1,Overrated,"Definitively this picture is overrated. The story is simple, nothing special, maybe a 8 year old boy would make it more spectacular, the film develops as a video game, a little bit enjoyable, not serious, i was very dissapointed."
1,i didnt even get the dvd,"i was very excited to own a good movie but when it came, it was just the dvd, there was no dvd.whats the point in that?"
1,Kill Bill,"The worst movie I ever viewed, made no sense at all, I fell asleep twice. What a joke!! And Those ugly toes, why didn't they just cut them off and just have Uma walk around on bloody stumps to a Burger King. And on the way, falling into the wood chipper from Fargo. And what about the whole story line of a bride getting shot in the head, why? didn't she put out? I mean she did pretty a good job while in the coma. Even Repoman and Rabbit proof fence beat this on by a mile."
2,This movie was really bad,"Kill Bill v1 resembled an old poorly-dubbed chinese kung fu movie far too much - the action sequences and sountrack were that hilarious. In addition, the animation sequences looked completely out of place. If q.t. was looking to reproduce the ""freshness"" of pulp fiction style-wise, imho he failed miserably. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I saw it on a nice new plasma screen at the Sun Valley Inn, after a decent meal."
1,Gratuitous violence posing as stylish,"Disgusting. Trash without any redeeming value. Violent to the point of making one feel depersonalised. If you want your children to become murderers, this is the film to get them. Tarantino has a great sense of black humor but none of it came out in this film. It was just degradingand sick. On my 5 worst list of all times."
2,A Postmodern Pootie Tang,"Even though the postmodern era has ended with september 11th, this movie persists in the motif. It falls in the mindless genre of Japanese action film, and oddly enough, the protagonist weilds a sword while on the airplane. Kill Bill is nuanced and subtle!"
1,You have got to be Kidding !!!,"This movie, was just horrible; I hated it, and if l could give it below one star, l would, in a heart beat.I can not see how anybody could like it, but it would seem people do - perhaps they were under the influence when watching it !!!"
2,Boys will be boys.,And this movie proves that girls can be too. One of the most boring distasteful movies I have ever seen.
1,Terrible....,"Just terrible.. If you feel good after watching this movie, you are crazy. Recently, some movies like this and ""Lost in Translation"" just exaggerate Japanese culture. As one of Japanese living in the U.S., I say ""Please, please don't do that. It's not funny."""
2,"Kill Bill, Volume 1",This movie was over done with violence and exessive gore. The only reason I gave it two stars is because Uma Thurman did such a fine job as an actress that she carried the whole movie. Also I have to add that the fight scenes/Kung Foo were very well choreographed. But basically the only reason I would have any interest in seeing the sequel is because of her performance. Other than that the movie would be garbage in my opinion.
1,"Amazing movie, terrible DVD","Kill Bill Vol.1 is a fantastic movie, if you like QT you will love this movie. The problem is this bland, almost featureless DVD. Miramax has already said that he's thrilled about being able to put out multiple versions of of this movie on DVD to make more money off the saps that buy the early versions. Rent this DVD and wait for the full thrills versions that will be out after Kill Bill Vol.2 makes it to DVD."
1,ALL HYPE.... Really lame and unoriginal,"Imagine Quentin Tarantino, a well known hollywod producer, gets tired of making original movies. Most of his movies ( Pulp Fiction, Dusk Til Dawn1,2,3 etc.) are entertaining, but have been done before or at least have a totally familiar theme. Well now, Quentin just decided to lower the bar even farther. Take B-grade kung fu movies, B-grade western movies, Japanese Animation movies, and steal the most famous scenes out of them. Then throw in tons of people getting killed. You might think this would equal action, but no, it gets old in two minutes. Both volume 1 and 2 are horrible. I tried to like these movies, but I don't understand how anyone could be entertained from this. Wait a minute! I know what it is! The best part in this series is playing name that scene! It's like a trivia book of other people's ideas!Don't bother"
1,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Matrix","It's basically a comic book for teens. Overblown dialogue and fight sequences in the tradition of those ridiculous choreographed Hong Kong Kung Fu Flicks of the 70's. Sometimes stylish in a trashy way and with occasional flashes of great music (loved the Japanese girl rock band.) But overall it gets boring after a while and your eyes drift to the clock. Worth a watch just to see what all the fuss was about, but ultimately a dud."
5,Kill Bill Kills,"As my girlfriends and I walked into the movie cinema on the weekend that Kill Bill was released, we were either going to watch Tarentino's movie or a Denzel flick.We picked Kill Bill, and what we saw was one of the most gorrish, violent, and bloody movies in our lives...And we loved every scene.Lucy Liu was the ""beast"" in her scene. Her entourage rocked! Uma Thurman was the best person for the character she portrays. At the end of the movie, we were left wanting more and when we saw that closing scene, we left the theater mad as the devil because we just knew that we wouldn't be able to wait for Vol. 2 with ease.Folks, get the movie. This one is a heavyweight."
3,"BUCKETS ""O"" BLOOD","The thing I took from this movie most of all is... how I saw more severed limbs and heads and open wounds squirting out blood. This river of blood was crazy,the blood would pour out from the wounds and then squirt across these huge rooms like it was under high pressure. I wish my water lines had this kind of pressure. One dude got his head severed and the blood came out so strong it knocked two other guys down it looked like a fire hose!! We all watched with our jaws slack as Uma hacked and sliced and cut and stabbed the whole Deadly 88's gang. there was so much blood.. oh my so much....how did the actors stand up?"
2,Very disappointing.,"I had high hopes for this movie. I thought both ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were great, innovative, interesting movies. But this movie... I totally wasted the $4 I paid to rent it.The first half was quite good. Very stylized, the characters seemed interesting, Uma was doing a great job. Then, all of a sudden, it's just all this extremely lame and gratuitious violence, not to mention that they stole (along with so many others) some of the wall-climbing ""Matrix"" moves. Boy, I'm tired of seeing those.The worst part, and my husband agrees, is that when people would get stabbed with the samurai blade or have a limb chopped off (it happened a lot), the blood would come out in the super-fine spray, like an airbrush, not like an artery had been severed. Call me a nitpicker, but that got old, too.I know Quentin Tarantino has better movies in him. I just hope he makes those movies before a third ""Kill Bill"" installment."
4,What is this mess!,This movie surfed on the blood of violence and nonsense. The fatalities are overly exagerated. It is unbelievable. I can't believe that I wasted my money on this crap.
3,Awesome Beeping Noise,At certain parts of kill bill volume I and II there is a really annoying beeping noise that i can not get rid of. I have had my copies sent back for new ones but the ones they returned do the sam thing.
4,A Celebration of Moviemaking!,"A esquisite and fine piece of action cinema comes in a powerful and weird film. Has the type of great balance of action and art, but has a few stupid glitches that could of easily been fixed. Miss this at your own risk! It's problably the most gorgeous B- movie ever made!"
4,Uma Rocks ... Lucy Lui & Vivica Fox ain't bad either!,"Watched this on the recommendation of a friend -- and I liked it! Ala Quentin Tarantino - it's super violent - but it's cartoonish violence. Someone's arm gets cut of ... and it spews like a geiser. It's gross but funny at the same time. Some the scenes actually ARE cartoons. You aren't horrified. It's like ... Monty Python meets all the Samurai movies you've ever seen.Uma, co-creator of these movies, is perfect as The Bride. Love the yello track suit, an homage to Bruce Lee. Lucy Lui - somehow this reminded me of her Ally McBeal days? Perhaps its the quietly lethal air she has about her!(some of the trivia tidbits about the conception and filming of this movie are really interesting - amazon has a compilation of much of them in the DVD listing)Kill Bill Vol. 2 has already been added to the netflix queue. (Where we finally get to see David Carradine!)"
5,"Bang, Bang! My Baby Shot Me Down","I see there are some people purposely posting one star reviews. Please, you wouldn't know a great movie if it hit you over the head with a sword. This movie is awesome! What QT did is he took pieces of old kung fu, spaghetti westerns movies and reshuffled it to make it his own unique style of film making. Clearly an original."
5,A Hell Of A Move!,"Kill Bill, man what a great movie it was! It was kinda different from the rest of Tarintinos movies but it was great. Very fun to watch and a great plot and everything! I loved the ending and im wating in pain for the next one to come out! I cant wait till it comes out. If I could have given it more than 5 stars I would have!"
2,Bad video feed,I finally gave up watching because of the bad quality of the video feed. The bits I saw were quite good.
2,Too self-satisfied,"I can put up with this director's questionable tendencies in other films he's made, because they are quite good. But this film was nowhere near the same caliber and was not just a waste of my time, it actually offended me in its treatment of Japanese cinema and thus helped me understand why some folks are refusing to see Django. In fact, it convinced me to boycott that film too"
2,way too much overkill....actually kinda pathetic and I like Uma Thurman.....,nothing worth reporting it really wasn't that good....could have had a little more opportunity for some sense of realism...but I read thats what many peeps like the stupidity of it....
3,"Not for small children, maybe not for children period","Kill Bill DVDOne wonders who is buying this stuff.Kill Bill was made by the extreme fringe of Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill is a quest for revenge.The Bride , Uma Thurman is carted away in a four-year-long coma. She wakes up and vows revenge. The movie is all about her revenge and how she gets it.Warning gobs and gobs of blood.Not something I'd let small children see, in fact I don't believe I'd let children of any age see it.If you enjoy Quentin Tarantino you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise save your money for something else.Gunner March 2008"
1,Wow...awesome!,"Man...Tarantino is back! And by back, I mean boring!If you like style without substance...Kill Bill! It's got awesome swordfights broken up by pointless moments of dead space and 8th-grade short-story dialogue! It's got one-sided characters! It's got the lamest cliffhanger ever! And it's only half of a movie! Ooh boy! I can't not wait not to see Vol. 2! [...]"
2,Very violent and bloody,"Saw this movie yesterday and believe me, there is way too much of violence than I have ever imagined. Especially the amount of blood and the way it has been portrayed (just sprinkling and squirting, god, awful), I feet very abhorrent. After watching full movie, I didn't understand why the assassins were trying to kill her in the first place. May be this is reveled in the second part, which I'm no way interested to see.If you enjoy violence with too much of blood, this movie is for you otherwise, your time and money is best spent on other good titles."
3,very so so...,"not really good, but not bad either... it's worth a watch, if you're really bored, but not much else."
3,Very unexpected Movie,"This Movie should not be showed to kids under 17 because movie is full of a lot of revenge. Do not be disappointed about Vivica Fox Or Lucy Liu.it's a long movie uma Is great for the character she portays, Alot of Kirate fighting & Sword Fighting makew this movie A THRILLER."
1,Overhyped,"If this isn't the most overhyped movie ever. Where is the Tarentino magic here? Was there any magical conversation pieces found in Resevoir Dogs? No. Just brutal, over the top violence.I was immensely disappointed. The movie was a joke. It's the old story of when your outnumbered 100-1 in a fight, you're actually at an advantage. Doesn't that become tiresome? The movie did!"
1,This One Tied for Worst Movie of All-Time,"Absolutely no reason to watch this movie. Watched for 30 minutes, and found it to be torture, with the worst bathroom humor and violence done in bad taste one could imagine. The guy who directed this film should be a bum on the streets, why make an atrocity like this? If I could have given it 0 stars I would, a complete waste of time and a real downer."
3,More like Monty Python,"The first half of the movie is awsome. The music, which Mr. Trarntino always uses to perfect effect, rocks. But it's when Ms Thurman arrives in Japan that is ""falls"" apart. The flying limbs and gushing blood. Sorry, it reminds me of a Monty Python movie."
1,TRASHCAN MOVIE!!!,"This movie should have been a comedy! Altho it wouldn't rate very high,I just laughed most of the time. I like action movies but this movie is more of a fairy tale. How could anyone rate this movie 5 stars it is simple trash! If you could rate on the minus side it would rate -5"
1,Terrible movies,"Tarantino is terrible if you wish to know more on this check out my review of the sequel to this movie. I can't believe you can buy the star wars trilogy with this movie, that's absolutely ridiculous. One good series, and the beginning of a terrible one."
2,this movie sucked,there was only 1 good part in this movie. it was in the begining when there was a fight between 2 chicks. that was the best part of the whole movie and the only reason it gets 2 stars. without this sceen it would have no starts. the movie looked good in the trailor and previews i saw 4 it but it kept changing from black and white back 2 color then 2 japanese anime crap. i am not 1 of those ppl that hate violence but evrytime a limb was cut off blood squirted out like a fountain and it looked so fake. i own many dvds and this is my least favorite 1. i would recamend renting this 1st cause there is 1 good sceen and those of u who like japanese fighting movies would like this. otherwise dont buy it bcause it sucked
3,"Decent Flick, Worth A Look","I'm not sure where to start, this film left me kinda confused about the quality of movie Tarantino is capable of.Firstly, the violence was hyped in this movie and really there isn't much of it. It was looks pretty fake. So i dont know why everyone is so grossed out by this movie. The Plot was OK, typical revenge plot, not many twists, straightforward. The high point of Kill Bill Vol1 was the fight choreography and the music. Dialogue was cheesy, profane typical of Tarantino movies. I'm personally a big fan of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs. Four Rooms and From Dusk Till Dawn. This offering however left me somewhat dissapointed. I dont think i'll be rushing to the theaters to see Kill Bill Vol2 and i certainly won't be bying this DVD."
4,Quentin's Best,"I've never been a big Tarantino fan (nor an Uma Thurmon fan), and I waited for this movie to come out on video before watching it. I had low expectations. Man! this movie blew me away!!! I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the filthy language (that's a hurdle that's hard for me to get over). But, aside from that, it was a great action-packed movie with excellent music and great acting. Uma will never do better than she did in this movie.One may be tempted to think this movie a little cheesy, but that's if one tries too hard to fit this movie into the scope of reality. It's not supposed to be realistic, it's supposed to be entertaining and humorous. When the guy gets his head chopped off, don't analyze the way the blood squirts out and think it's unrealistic, just laugh at it! You've got to have a good sense of humor while viewing this. If you don't mind blood and violence, and enjoy seeing a good revenge movie, this is the movie for you."
3,Why does everyone think this guy is so great?!?!?!,"Well, Kill Bills and okay action movie, and well QT admits to stealing and taking from other movies, but why is this guy considered a genious, i was viewing kill bill for the second time the other day and i was trying to figure out why the hell this director was using certan lighting and dramatic shots for bogus scenes, it seems he does alot of stuff just cause it ""looks cool"" and that there is a rape of what his inspirations where trying to establish on screen, there's alot of great work out there and then this guy exploits it. Kill Bill 1 and 2 are good movies but there greatly over exagerated, if any one starts breaking into movie history, directors, (comic books) you'll see that he's not doing anything that hasn't been done, he does good work but i second guess his ""genious"" so Kill Bill gets 3 stars"
4,COMIC BOOK STYLE TURNED INTO GORY MOVIE,"Tale of a female assassin who is betrayed by her organization and, after recovery, begins the process of hunting each individual down separately. Promises lots of gore, slick fighting scenes and Uma Thurman back on the screen.Best scene was the fight sequence against the Crazy 88. Very kewl. :)Unfortunately, no audio commentary from Tarantino."
5,old school movie,"this is a older movie, but a good one. had to get it for my dvd collection. lots of action"
1,Eeeh? Did I miss something?,"Blood, blood and more blood. Fighting, fighting and more fighting. Maybe the fans like it, but I'm so old fasion that I want to have a plot in a film to like it. If you like gore this is your film, but I don't like it."
5,Quentin Kills,"EVerything about this movie is what you'd expect from Quentin. It is comparable to his classic Reservoir Dogs in innovation, style and his innate ability to pick up on popular culture conciousness and take it to the next level. If this homage to 1970s, King Fu doesn't get to you then you just don't like Quentin. The end fight scene is better than any I've seen in action/fantasy, Kung Fu with swords based in the Orient."
2,A VERY BAD DEJA VU,"Why did I get the distinct impression I was watching a very poor parody of ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"", starring Vincent Price.A slight bit of humour (mixed in between profanities); and throw in a Bruce Lee film, and you have: KILL BILL, VOLUME 1.A very bad movie. The anime segments done properly had the potential for a bit of creativity. The only problem was: I kept thinking how much money Tarantino saved by not having to film these sequences with actors and actresses,--live action style.All in all, a very forgettable movie. I feel no need to see volume 2.Braithwaite"
2,Yuck,"My opinion of the movie has somewhat mellowed since the last few days after seeing Kill Bill. Still, after mellowing, I find the movie distasteful. The only thing that keeps me from rating this movie even lower is the excellent cinematography and the extremely well done fight scenes (alright, alright, the whole spurting blood thing was funny), and the insanely cool character GoGo. I understand that its a parody of many movies and has got lots of influences, blah blah blah, but all in all, it was a huge corny ball of weirdness. This movie is SO overdramatized, and sometimes the script and the dialogue makes me want to hurle. During most of the movie, it felt like Tarantino was trying REALLY REALLY hard to make a live action movie based on an anime or something. Makes my head hurt just thinking about this movie. But hey, don't let this review stop you from watching this trippy film. If you like watching skinny blond girls who speak bad japanese wave swords around, go ahead."
3,I thought it is was last DVD but I was wrong,"OK guys,If you want some blood without any question from where it was derived - this is your movie.However, the more you are looking into the skeleton of the movie the more you are understanding than movie makers just wanted your money and nothing else.As a former doctor I can tell you definitely (try to judge me for that)that after 4 (four) year in coma you can not jump from your bed and go whatever. It is nonsence. Sorry for possible mistake. I would be proud of you if you could just move your finger!!! THis movie is complete mess. Who did this Massacre and what for - this is not informated till the end of the movie. But as I said before - If you like blood without any explanation - do forward."
1,A Horrible Excuse for Gratuitous Violence!,Why anyone would waste their money purchasing this movie is beyond me. The concept of a female assasin is not an acceptable excuse for gratuitous violence. Don't we have enough in the world already? Quentin Tarrantino has certainly done it again. This man obviously has a passion for morbid violence and evil. This film is yet another example of how the public is seduced by violence if it is package in a slick sophisticated manner. Don't be fooled!
5,I don't care if there wasn't much of a plot.,"Did Kill Bill have a strong plot or character deveopment? Nope. But, so what. I cant think of very many movies that have been as entertaining as Kill Bill. When martial arts movies, or action movies in general, try to actually be a good movie they almost always suck. They usually end up just being silly, have 10 million plot holes, and don't make much sense. Thats aasuming they don't make you fall asleep. Obviously there are a few exceptions, but I wont get into that.But Kill Bill, after the first few minutes(during the opening credits if you are familiar with 70's Kung Fu movies) you know what you are in for. A movie that is ENTERTAINING. Come on, the movie has Uma Thurman with a samurai sword. No one should watch this movie looking for a acadamy award wining material. Yes on some levels Kill Bill has to be one of the worst movies ever made, but holy crap it was awesome."
4,STOP REVIEWING ITEMS THAT AIN'T OUT YET!!!,"If you want to write a review about the movie only, please do it on the ""Theatrical release"" product page.Leave this page to talk about the Blu Ray when it actually comes out, and then review the product as an overall package, aspect ratio, extras, transfer quality, audio, packaging, languages & subtitles, etc.Most people already know the movie, but even the people who don't know it, don't want to read an essay about its alleged meaning --there are other places for that - IMDB, for example.So until the BD arrives, please refrain to post any more ""reviews"" of a product you don't own yet. Hopefully this comment will get pushed down with REAL product reviews when the day comes.Have a question about this release? Scroll down, you'll find forums to ask and people glad to help you. Want to review the movie and its cultural context and whatnot? Go to IMDB or the Theatrical release here on Amazon. Thanks."
3,typically Quentin Tatantino . . .,"Not much of a story line, but a lot of violence filmed in such a way that it didn't seem as horrific as it is in real life. Typically Tarantino."
2,Great Movie. Terrible DVD,"Exactly. Kill Bill vol. 1 itself is a great action flick. It's extremely gorey and violent to almost a comedic extent at times but for fans of martial arts movies or Tarantino, it will not disappoint. However this is, obviously a rushed DVD. There are very limited extras and since vol 2 is out in theaters, it will only be a matter of time until we see the special edition with deleted/extended scenes, and a collector's box featuring the 2 volumes together in time for christmas. Be warned that during one particular ultra violent action scene, the screen flashes from color to black and white in order to avoid the NC-17 rating. If you want to see Tarantino's film uncensored, then buy the Japanese import or wait for the next dvd release. If this doesn't bother you and you just want to see the movie you saw at the theater then pick this up. Just please don't give Miramax your money twice."
5,Fantastic movie!,"This movie is really fun. The way that Tarantino uses obscure music to set the mood for his movies is out of control. I just saw Vol. 2 and I was a little dissapointed, but Vol. 1 is really cool. If you are a Tarantino fan (Pulp Fiction, Resivoir Dogs, True Romance) you will like this movie. Otherwise you may think that there is too much swearing and violence."
5,Unbiased at the start,"Not being a Quentin fan, I came in without to much expectations. I watched Pulp Fiction after the hype and found it over rated.But, with that said, this movie was incredible. It captured everything that made the classic Bruce Lee movies great and expanded on them. The anime to tell the short story was inspired and perfectly created.I definate must add to my DVD collection."
5,Great flick. A true classic,"Tarantino at his best. His love of old westerns, and martial arts films is quite evident.The cast is great, which is mandatory for a film like this in which the bad buys give the film its identity."
5,awesomeness!!,Everything was great!! I ordered on Dec.13th and received DVD two days later!! Thank You!! Keep up the good work!
4,Awesome Movie,"Tarantino really outdoes himself with this one. All-star cast, interesting dialogue, intense fight scenes, incredible musical arrangements... you will not get bored with this gem of a movie. Uma Thurman really kicks ass, both literally and figuratively!"
2,Hugely Disappointing,"Mr Tarantino should have used lightsabers - it would have made the movie far more believable. Also, Uma Thurman's character should have been played by Nicholas Cage.Verdict:Avoid"
3,The pricing structure will have to change to be successful.,I agree about the price. I'm going to have to think twice about paying over $20 for a UMD - and I'm unlikely to buy it if I already have the DVD version. I'm either going to buy one or the other. I think the sweet spot is $14.99. I supposed if I just bought the DVD and made a 'copy' for the PSP that would probably work better for me overall.Hopefully SONY will price them decently and not let greed overcome them. I have bought House of Flying Daggers and Hellboy at Software etc. and pre-ordered National Treasure and Hero from Amazon so I'll have four already. We'll see how this plays out...
2,mixed feeling,"I found the cinematography fantastic and the music and dialogue as well. The storyline and philosophy is based on Japanese samurai movies from beginning to end. But I found the violence to be unbelievably over the top for an R movie. ""Natural Born Killers"" is tamed by comparison. Slightly off topic but I was shocked to see someone coming in with a friend and both bringing their 4 kids obviously all under age of 10 to watch it; oh the baby was there too and we all sat in the first three rows of the theatre.To the reviewer who thought it trumps every samurai movie ever made, I seriously doubt it but in terms of sheer violence, blood, and gore I think it has. Also to the same reviewer, anime can be ultr-violent but that is not the norm; I don't think most societies are as obsessed with simulated violence as Americans are.Although as an adult I kind of liked the movie; but the excessive violence was a major turnoff."
2,Tarantino... You are not Sergio Leone.,"Sick of this guy riding on Pulp fiction and Reservoir Dogs for the rest of his life. They were great movies... but this movie is an imitation of Sergio Leone\Ennio Morricone work. There is no vision here... In fact what tarantino has done is work backwards. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns were inspired by Japanese films amongst many things. Here, Tarantino turns a spaghetti Western back into a Samurai tale. There are scene for scene shots from 'Good, Bad and the Ugly' and that makes me angry.Its an entertaining film but Tarantino is just ripping Sergio a new one... Kill Bill Vol II and Inglorious Basterds aswell.Then there is the homage to B-grade movies ahem ahemand the manga derived animation... as if we've been hiding under a rockHas he devoted his life to resurrecting other people's work.He gets the big bucks for this? He openly admits he likes someone or something and he rips it off and thats ok now..."
3,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this film is so good! i didnt want 2 watch it at first because it seemed 2 voilent, but in the end i did watch it & woz suprised because i atually enjoyed it! it is voilent but its got a good story 2 it aswell tho. tho at times hard 2 follow! the only bad thing about this film is that at the end i wanted 2 see the next one as well!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL"
5,Kill Bill,"Tarintino is the king of retro cinema. He is the only director who can recapture the golden age of seventies cinema,Kill Bill is an outstanding film,this masterpiece is like a mainstream Golden Harvest film. Bring on volume 2!!Also release them both on DVD as soon as possible please."
4,Who says white girls can't do martial arts?,"I was a bit skeptical about this film, simply because Uma Thurman was going to do a bit of martial arts in it. No longer will I be saying that - she does an excellent job with the fight scenes (and there are a lot of those) and I definitely can't wait until installment two comes out.This movie leaves so much undisclosed: her name is always bleeped out, the news about her child, and who the heck Bill is. Tarantino did a great job of cliff-hanging, and leaving room for more information in movies to come.The cinematography was also rather creative, in my opinion. I like how it went from black and white, to color, to animation; from English to Japanese. The language changes seem so fluid that it took me a minute to notice that another language was being spoken.Kudos to 'Kill Bill.' Tarantino gives us a two-hour bloodbath, and keeps us wanting more!"
2,Curiously unimpressive,"I went to the cinema expecting to understand what the hype was all about. Maybe I should have done some research beforehandEveryone was amazed at Tarantino's fourth film, saying 'Oh God, it must be good'.Pul Fiction - yesResevoir Dogs - yesJackie Brown - No!Kill Bill - Hell no!This was a film based purely on action, with no thought on a complex storyline. A simple revenge based film, with admittedly good choreography, but unrealistic battles and a general poor filmEveryone also seems insistent that Tarentino is a genius. To my mind, for genius read pretentious. Some scenes were genius, but the anime sections went on far too long, and as for other parts...Actions fanatics may enjoy this. I certainly did not"
1,Pretentious and derivative,"Yep, pretentious and derivative. I have no objection to the violence--I have tremendous respect for good movie violence--but Tarantino has ripped off so many other film makers mercilessly with this movie, it's ridiculous. I wouldn't even give it one star but evidently that's not an option..."
1,"""intentionally bad"" is still bad","Ugh, this is one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. And I'm saying this as someone who loved Pulp Fiction! Watching this rancid exercise in self~indulgence is like being trapped in a car on a long road trip with a boring film nerd who just won't shut up. I have been told that a lot of this tripe is ""intentionally bad"", which is apparently a good thing, but nevertheless intentionally bad is still bad. It's evidently based on all the B movies Tarantino has seen, so I guess it's trash stealing from trash. Avoid unless you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone else play video games.Ivan Rorick"
5,"price, not that big of an issue","the price isnt much higher than dvd's, and converting a movie to umd format, you can't expect it to be cheaper i mean come on...... and the quality is just as good as dvd's, if not better."
2,Incomplete storyline,"A vengeful bride, a murky assasination plot and lots of violence and gore are the key elements in this Quentin Tarantino movie. As ususal, he tells the story in a series of plots which relate to a larger theme. The problem is that at times the plots are not in sequence. This leads to some confusion on the part of the audience. Combine this with the undeveloped background of the characters and the audience is left with too many questions. There is a humorous element in the premise of a bride (unnamed) who is exacting revenge with a Katana sword, sort of like Bride Magazine meets Highlander, but overall it is a silly unbelievable plot with little redeeming value. Some good sword techniques if you are into the Martial Arts though. I understand Volume 2 will be out soon and will explain some of the things which were left out in this version of the story. Maybe someone who sees it will fill me in."
1,"Violent, disgusting, pointless","I find it sad that this movie has received such accolades when it's nothing more than one gratuitiously violent scene after another. For example (spoiler alert), early on in the movie, Uma Thurman kills the mother of a four-year-old girl -- right in front of her. (And since when do four-year-olds ride the schoolbus? Get a clue, Quentin.) Later, during the anime sequence, a young girl hides under the bed while her mother and father are brutally, graphically slaughtered. Ha, ha... am I supposed to laugh now? Do yourself a favor and skip this disgusting, unfunny waste of celluloid and buy something that will make you feel good. Like, say, Chaplin's ""City Lights."""
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!,"Now, don't get me wrong- I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I'm in awe of Tarantino, love the postmodern ironic/unironic constant appropriation that infuses this movie with style, panache, thrills, and giggles. It's a GREAT movie!But, the DVD is TERRIBLE! A music video (not even a good one) of some wacky Japanese chicks (give me Shonen Knife anyday instead) and ""The Making of..."" is ALL you get for special features. And, And, AND,,,IT'S CENSORED! How come only ONE of Sophie's arms are cut off? Where's the second? HOW MUCH IS MISSING FROM THIS DVD? WHY ARE WE BEING SOLD A RE-EDITED VERSION OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE????Why? To make more money, to justify a stupid ""director's cut"". This is a rip-off, and I'm appalled that Tarantino, who claims to love cinema, should abuse us this badly.Wait for the director's cut... don't buy this piece of trash DVD."
1,Vile,"A lot of people think Kill Bill is art. But, then, a lot of people thought the Earth was flat.This is a snuff film. The violence is tawdry, unexplained, and the camera alternately snoozes and leers over it. The characters are *less* than cartoonish stereotypes -- half of them don't even get named, and none of them have an inkling of motivation. The editing and soundtrack are plagiarized from much better movies.Just a waste."
1,Wish I Could Rate 0 Stars,"Kill Bill, Vol. 1 deserves fewer than 1 star. I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel. It's essentially a third-rate, high-violence, somewhat twisted Charlie's Angels. Two main problems. Unlike the Angels, Uma Thurman is not, in the least respect, attractive. The second problem--she can't act. She's simply a terrible actress. Can movies still be good even with bad acting? Sure. Unfortunately, Kill Bill still sucks for a number of reasons. I know it's an action movie, but even as far as action flicks go, this movie has a crap storyline. I know the special effects are ""supposed to"" suck, but that idea in itself kind of...well, sucks. Overall, have I seen worse films? Yes. But only two. Bottom line: If you appreciate skilled acting and cinematography, avoid Kill Bill, Vol. 1 at all costs. There's nothing for you here."
2,not even close to what I expected,"If you like the idea of a chick killing a lot of people using samurai swords, this might be just another average movie for you. Otherwise it's not worth your time. The movie lacks storyline and development. Acting is bad. And what's up with the insertion of anime in this? It was 10 minutes long too..what the heck are they thinking about?"
1,No point,"Besides being incredibly boring, I don't believe Uma Thurman could beat up a wood duck, much less the hundreds of victims she defeats in this move."
1,A MOVIE FOR GEEKS!,"As other reviewers mentioned, Quinten Tarontino has to be a real Geek. Only such a personality would have these stupid fantasies of burtally mass murdering people.Don't waste your time on this trash."
1,I don't understand why this movie gets such good reviews,"I saw this film when it was in theaters. I don't understand why so many people think this film is so great. It reminds me a geat deal of an older movie ""Falling Down"", but with an angry white woman as the lead instead of an angry white male. Being a non-white in this movie is a death sentence. Umma Thurman's character makes it a point to kill or mame just about every non-white in her path. I walked away from this movie wondering if Tarrintino doesn't have some serious issues with the non-whites of the world."
1,Bad Attempt into action kung foo,Honest truth is I feel asleep watching this movie within 20 minutes in. I thought the movie was boring. Yeah there was enough fighting in the movie but the fighting was not that convincing. The movie would be perfect for kids who just love to watch fights and blood. Other then that you would just watch this movie and wonder why they even bothered making the movie.
5,Movie,I got this movie during the holiday season as I could not pass up a opportunity to own his awesome movie on blueray.
5,"Fun, no question about that.","Kill Bill was indeed a daring movie and creative to the extreme, putting down the other movies released last year. This movie had a mix of everything everybody tends to love, even the unexpected -- and I mean that in a very good way."
5,Kill Bill is awesome,"I just saw this movie, and it is great. i rented it for DVD, and i must say, this is a spectacular movie. Quentin tarentino has created a masterpiece. I am a big fan of high adrenaline actcion films, and japanese katanas ( i own one). this movie combines the two and creates the sweet, sweet equivalent of mixing lemons, sugar, and water to lemonade. it makes me want to see kill bill volume 2 tomorrow!"
1,terrible,thought I would watch this and then Volume 2 on a movie channel on TV...made it through this one and deleted Vol 2.
2,Quentin is a Fantastic Director...,"which is the best thing that comes out in this movie. It's a heavy kung-fu action flick that attempts to outdo all other kung-fu and action flicks. It's extremely bloody; well past the point of being ridiculous.Overall, the music, directing and cinematography are perfect. They are the only things that keep this movie alive.While Tarantino's writing hasn't gotten worse, per-se, it's just not up to par. The dialog is good, not great. The story is fairly routine. And, except for the girl with the ball and chain, the characters are not particularly memorable. I didn't find myself identifying with, liking, or even rooting for any of them.Unfortunately, even the best production and effects can't make up for a weak backbone. Quentin calls this his ""4th movie"" during the intro. Maybe he should stick with that count but include True Romance and scrap this one."
4,the shipping is great,i think you should have a selection of movies and ask the customer which regional psp they are getting then it will work i have 2 PSP's one american and one japanise so if i buy the any rejion UMD DVD it will work but most of i will recomend u guys definetly!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,hmmm,"Well I liked it, it was amusing. It wasn't brilliant, nor indicitive or a morally defunct society, one thing I could notice, but it was good It made fun of older japanese anime, the sword fights were not perfect, but interesting. I laughed alot, the soundtrack was well done (having Wutang's producer do it was a good call) I liked it, but to the rest of you, saying this movie is THE GREATEST THING OF ALL TIME, or...THE WORST THING OF ALL TIME....get over yourselves, yeesh."
4,not as good as his others...but still a must have!,i really give this one 4.5 stars especially for uma thurman's performance. she is killer (literally) in this movie! the 70's styling of the movie was okay but a bit unbelievable. still some great fight scenes and a sick storyline. a must have!
4,Full DVD Not Here,The full unedited movie was released on DVD in Japan not here. jbox.com is a good place to buy it if you have a region free player.Movie 5 starsDVD 4 stars
4,Best movie of 2003,"I saw a lot of action movies in 2003, from ""Daredevil,"" ""X-Men 2,"" ""The Hulk"" to ""The Matrix"" sequels and ""Terminator 3"" -- but ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" was the single best movie I saw all year.Some people refused to see the movie because they didn't want to pay twice to see both parts. Well, even if you just see the first part, it's worth the money.Tarantino brings together all the elements: Action, suspence, acting, dialogue, and of course music. Most movies are filmed and the music is added on later, but Tarantino sets up each scene to last as long as each song on the soundtrack, making the movie into a series of music videos.And the over-the-top martial arts sequences blow ""The Matrix"" out of the water. Any fan of Tarantino, or martial arts movies, or good movie soundtracks, needs to own this movie.(Of course, I'm holding out to get Vol. 1 and 2 together in one box -- but if you missed Vol. 1 in the theater, you should definitely get the DVD, then see Vol. 2 in the theater.)"
3,Kill Bill bleeds over the screen,"This a pretty good movie and it had A LOT of blood. However, it did not have enough depth. They could have added some more to the movie but it was alright anyway and it makes you want to watch the sequel. The movie did have some good fight scenes though. Overall it was pretty interesting to watch so if you are looking for a good action movie, this is a good one to see. However, warning, this is not for the faint of heart. There is much blood and gore. But if you don't mind watching someone getting their head chopped off and then seeing the blood spill out of their lifeless body then by all means this is the movie for you. By the way all of the blood looks extremely fake and seems to be made the same way the blood was made for the comic book scenes. What a pity."

2,Say it ain't so Quint!,I'm not a professional movie critic but atleast I know a piece of crap when I see it. Any critic that gave this turd a high rating has got to have there head so far up quint's @$$ that they need a flashlight to write their review. I love all quint's movies (this is the exception). All of his flicks are great with witty dialogue and gorey action scenes. But this one was such a disappointment it almost brought me to tears. I felt I should say my piece and let everyone know not to be misguided by critics or any fanboys that say this is a great movie. Hey I like quint's flicks but atleast I can be objective and not come off as some fart sucking fanboy. Jeez!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED! But I still think Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors ever! I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the scene with Sonny Chiba. Other than that the movie was pretty bad.
1,Boring,"This movie is really dull. I saw it in the theater and wished I had a remote. Let's have a long scene where Uma Thurman pretends that she can't speak Japanese but maybe she really can even though she can't even pronounce ""yakuza"" correctly. Let's have this go on for five minutes and then find out that it is completely unimportant and irrelevant to the story. What fun. There's a reason those bad kung fu movies were only shown in ""grindhouses"" - they were crappy and very few people wanted to see them. Okay, let's be cool and say that bad is good, and pretend we're the first ever to say that things are relative. That will really show our parents, huh? This is a movie for fourteen year old boys. Dumb ones."
1,A complete waste of 20 bucks!,"I loved Tarantino movies like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" so I paid 20 bucks for the DVD thinking this movie would be great too. WRONG!! This movie is so bad that I had to turn it off after about 45 minutes. Probably only the 3rd or 4th time I've had to do that in my life, so that's pretty bad. It is very slow-moving and boring, and it constantly strays away from the point. You have to sit through about 15 minutes of cartoon-fighting which I thought was retarded. If I wanted to watch cartoons I'd borrow my nephew's DVDs. There wasn't nearly as much fighting or violence as in his other movies (at least in the first half) but of what violence it did have sucked. And the parts where he tried to make it funny were not at all funny. They were stupid. I can't believe this movie sucked so bad! What a huge disppointment. Don't waste your money - it sucks!"
1,what can i say?,"Kill Bill is the typical american film. With lots of super special effects with lots of violence and with bad actors. But this is the kind of films that americans likes. I am upset because we are going to have 100 kill bill films. Thats the same that happend with good films like matrix 1 or terminator 1. There were good films. But they made another 2 films on the american way. They won millons of dolars but they ruined what it was a good story.Continue watching jack ass ,beavis and buthead. The mirrors of the american societyschwarzenegger for president!!"
5,Genre Highlight Revival,"I myself have read the early script and have followed the development of Kill Bill. Although I have not seen the movie yet, and I am pretty sure it isn't even finally cut, but no matter what you want to expect or what doubts you may have, Kill Bill will be more influencial than the movies it's influenced by. Kill Bill is a HOMMAGE to all kinds of Tarantino's favorite movies which is reflected by the choice of actors, characters and ways of filming.I especially look forward to the scene where Uma Thurman is gonna cut a baseball in half in mid-air!!Be sure to watch the awesome Trailer."
3,"Good movie, but cover is partially broken","I bought this for myself since I really like the movie although when I got it a couple of minutes ago, the cover was partially broken (the clip to close it was broken and the disc is a little dirty/sticky) I was not very happy..."
1,very disappointing,"The fight scenes are a joke, with limbs flying everywhere, and blood spraying everywhere. There is a 10 minute cartoon in the middle of the film?????, and two loud beeps near the beginning...an audio error I suppose. Save you're money."
2,brutal and profane,"This film is very creative in an almost plagiaristic sort of way, coming across like a blend of Jackie Chan and spaghetti western. At the same time, it is a long string of hyper violence, fountains of blood, profanity and crude sexual references. It reminded me of an gratuitously violent video game made into a movie. It closes without ending, setting the viewer up for a sequal. I find very little here to recommend."
1,Garbage,"I knew it would be, but I was tricked into watching it. My co-workers were going to go watch kill bill 2 and told us all to watch the first one to know what was going on in the second. Either way, I never go to see 2, and on top of that I fell asleep during that too long fight scene with lucy lu. I was just disapointed. But I am anxious to see 2 so I'll know what becomes of Bill... i'm sure he dies though... seeing it's called kill bill. ultimately, if you don't like fight scenes that take up the better part of an hour and too much fake blood, this isn't he movie for you."
1,Kitsch.,I guess when you have money and connections in Hollywood you canslap together something as bad as this and call it a movie.
2,Corny as expected.,"When I first saw a preview, I said to myself...What a F***?? The yellow haired western women wearing Bruce Lee Uniform from a movie GAME OF DEATH, and holding a Japanese Katana. Hmmm...This does not make sense. Years later, I saw the film when my friend insisted to see it. What a stupid corny movie~!!! I liked the music, and artistic screen, so it gets two stars."
1,"Kill Quentin, Volume 1","This is one nauseating piece of garbage. What next from this supposed ""genius"" - a multi-volume epic about someone with chronic diarrhea? Every critic who praised this tripe should be horsewhipped. And would someone please explain to me how, after 4 years in a coma, Uma the ugly can suddenly sit bolt upright in bed? And how is it that her legs are atrophied, but her arms are fully functional, hmmm? And why for God's sake didn't they use a body double for the foot shots of this chick? Talk about ugly feet - in extreme close-up, no less! Yecch! I've seen better looking feet on any number of zoo animals! But perhaps it is in keeping with the nasty, ugly tone of this trash masquerading as art. What a bunch of [bleep]!"
2,Abysmal,"I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs, and was hoping this movie was of the same calibre. Unfortunately, this movie was not nearly as clever, interesting, or rich in plot as Reservoir Dogs. In fact, if you took out the gratuitous violence, and replaced the overdone and unrealistic fighting scenes with something that resembles a plot, it would still just barely qualify as a movie."
1,Movie SUCKS!!!,"This movie proves once again hollywood which has this obsession ofviolence to promote movies stinks real bad! Any viewer who claims this is a wonderful movie needs to get his head examine!! If you want to see real gore, go to your local morgue and smell the real death of dead human corps. This movie sucks real bad!!!!!V."
1,horrible,This movie was very stupid and comic like. I cannot believe i wasted a couple of hours in my life on this movie.
1,More pollution from one of Hollywood's sickest minds,"All this movie did is confirm my suspicions that QT is a loudmouth wannabe auteur who can't get over shocking people forfun and profit. Idiot. Why doesn't he just keep his adolescent femme fatale stroke fantasies to himself instead of inflicting them on the world?And I just don't get America. People freak out over a tiny glimpse of part of Janet Jackson's breast, and yet this ultra-violent, dehumanizing, brutal, over-hyped empty garbage continues to be produced. Go figure. Anything for a buck in Tinseltown, I suppose. The saddest part is that children will watch it. This filth is one of the best arguments for censorship I can think of. Way to set the bar lower, Quentin!"
1,I am surprised people like this kind of movies!,I just saw the 4 star rating and renting this DVD. The only thing that's good about this movie is music. I felt the movie is tooooo voilent and worthless and is made by the director just to look different! Everything looks too artificial and you get a feel director concentrated more on trying to be different rather than trying to make a good movie.Fountains of Blood would be a more appropriate name for this movie!
3,"Great visuals, but not much of anything else","Whether you like this movie depends completely on you.Either you will like the fight scenes, which are pretty awesome, and ignore the fact that there is not much of a plot (especially in this first volume), or you will keep waiting for something to happen besides a bunch of people getting killed and be completely disappointed.That being said, I enjoyed watching this first volume. It was much better than the second volume, which spends a lot of time on a plot which I could not stand. Someone who is expecting something other than a lot of graceful carnage, however, will not enjoy it."
4,Kill Bill:Volume 1,"This is a fun movie, pure entertainment but of course can't be taken seriously. A lot of action and subtle humor."
3,"Lovely, but a bit too violent for many palates.","I, personally, very much enjoyed this movie. However, there were times where I wondered whether I was watching a movie, or simply watching violence erupt on screen. This movie was definately filled with action, high paced, as well as slower paced suspence. The unfortunate thing is that is seems that for all the action, there is very little of the story.Overall, it was a high-quality movie, but if you're looking for something with a good, strong storyline, you may want to look elsewhere."
3,Great for the price.,"This little laminator does its job fairly well considering the price.I have to let it warm up much longer than the ""go"" light suggests, and sometimes I have to put lamination through a few times to get it to finish.Otherwise, great! Light and easy to travel with."
3,Royal pl 2100 Laminator,Was very satisfied with product until the release button quit working and the document got stuck and I couldn't get it out.The warranty was out but I had only used it about twenty times.
4,Great book,This book has great illustration and the classic Aesop Fables I expected. The stories are short and easy to read.
5,lovely thinking for the reader,"I have always loved Easops Fables...and had a book of my own when I was a little girl.Now I am buying a book for my grandchild, and am pleased to see that the pictures and layout are as I remember my book.I do not like the modern childrens books with very way out designs, and the different way of telling the old stories we all loved when we were young.This treasury of easops fables seems to be just what I would expect from an old favourite."
3,"a great book, but not for my classroom","While I appreciate this book for its beautiful, large illustrations, I wish I had browsed the table of contents before purchasing it. I had intended to use this book with my first grade class because we are studying Aesop's Fables. However, since two of the fables in this book contain the word ""ass,"" this book is not appropriate for my classroom. I have no problem using it with my own children, however, so I'm not sorry that I bought it!"
3,Disappointment,"My husband bought this for our daughter, so he could read them to her. He remembered an Aesop's Fables book he had as a child with 50-100 stories in it. So he enthusiastically bought this book, and was disappointed to discover it only has 20 stories. He didn't feel he got his money's worth."
3,Not what I expected,I was hoping for a more complete version. The pictures are nice and it has most of the classics. You can get a more complete version for the same price though.
5,Wonderfully written and enormously engaging.,"Normally a book about a physically and mentally disabled child would not be my first choice of reading material. ""The Boy in the Moon"" manages to give both knowledge and personal insight into the author and his family's relationship with his son Walker, without a lick of sappiness or self pity. The book is divided into 3 overlapping parts, the first, about Walker, his family and the hardships and joys of raising a child with so many problems; in the 2nd part the author takes some trips to meet other children and their families who suffer from this disease and also goes a bit further into the genetics of CFC; in the 3rd part the author explores various ideas and plans for Walker's future."
3,A matter of taste - and overproduction,"The sound of these arrangements is very professionally done, but it's just not my cup of tea. The pan flute is a simple acoustic instrument and it doesn't hold up here against these complex and elaborately produced arrangements. I would prefer that other acoustic instruments provide any accompaniment.Also, Amazon lists 12 songs and my copy starts off with ""Angels we have heard on high"" for a total of 13."
2,Ordinary detective and ordinary sex,"If you are interested by Domination/Submission or SM, forget this book. If you like stories of private eyes intermingled with sex, rather try the series of novels with the character Alex Kane of John Preston."
4,Definitely For Adults Only as the by-line suggests,"For a first glimpse into the 'Idol' world of homo-erotica this book could be seen as a must. Although a sequal (to Chains of Deceit) the reader loses nothing from missing the first novel.Although the ending is slightly disappointing the levels and variations on the sexual scenes should more than make up for it.I read the entire novel in one train journey, and bought another from the series for my return."
2,LANGUAGE GAFFE,"When I saw the part of the movie where there were supposed to be Chinese soldiers, one of them was speaking Tagalog---the national language of the Philippines. I can't believe that this mistake was overlooked. That spoiled it for me."
2,Keys to Boredom,"The cure for insomnia. Dull screenplay that drags on for over 130 minutes. Almost nothing happens the first half, all kinds of background story that isn't needed and is dull. Overall, this movie is political and religious propaganda. Chinese sets aren't very convincing either. Did I mention this film is dull? It's dull!"
5,The measure of success,"So little is called success by the world. But success in the eyes of God entails dying to self and giving all we have for the sake of the kingdom. Humility and a joy that comes from acknowledging life as a gift even in the disappointments and setbacks that make us appear to be failures, that is how God measures success. It is a rare jewel when we find a production where Hollywood 'gets it.' Mother Teresa used to say that God did not require results, only faithfulness. This is a moving and inspiring story of one who went practically unnoticed to the world but, of whom the scripture says, 'the world was not worthy.' Very well done indeed."
2,Can't hold a candle to the details of the beautifully written book.,"Liking the book so much, I immediately purchased the DVD. Did not care for it. Having read the book with all of the details, the movie just could not hold a candle to it. I was very disappointed with the movie.So much was left out that if I had not read the book first, I don't know that I could have even made sense of the storyline. Some of the greatest, funniest, saddest parts of the book were not even in the movie at all. All of the beautifully written details were gone. I just think the movie does a poor job of interpreting the touching parts of the book, which IMHO is what makes the book a masterpiece.For all of you who like this movie, all I can say is read the book, (if you haven't already) it will blow you away."
4,AJ Cronin.. great old movie,enjoyed this movie after reading the book. great story and well acted. book and movie are excellent..
5,Excellent,The Keys of the KingdomI received the DVD in very good condition. It is a wonderful story and I look forward to watching it many times. The actors are excellent and the story very moving. It makes for a very pleaseant few hours of viewing.
5,"THE MOST HEART TOUCHING,RELIGIOUS FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!","One of Gregory Peck,s finest roles ever! BETTER Than GOING MY WAY. A True Classic Film !"
5,Movie purchased through Amazon,"This is the first time I have ever seen or purchased ""The Keys of the Kingdom"". I had remembered seeing some previews on TCM one time but never saw the movie.I am glad Amazon had it in stock because I am an avid fan of Gregory Peck.The actors and movie makers of today should take some lessons on how to make movies without all the muck and mire and profanity that they have today. It is a very refreshing film of excellent quality and clarity. I am just sorry Thomas Mitchell had to die in the movie. He is another wonderful actor. The first time I remembered seeing him was in ""Stagecoach"" with John Wayne. Who, by the way I might add, is the one that made me decide to join the Marine Corps in January of 1951 to September 1973, a veteran of both ""Korea"" and ""Vietnam"". After seeing ""The Sands of Iwo Jima."" Another great film of excellent acting.Lloyd Breckenridge, MGySgt.USMC (Retired)."
5,The Keys of the Kingdom,My copy was excellent in quality in video and audio. I enjoyed the film as much now as in the past. I was very pleased that this story had made it to dvd. Thank you. It's still an excellent story.
2,Waste of money!!!,After talking to the rep at Fram he suggested This HP oil filter. I hoped it would boots my oil pressure like the Fram rep recomended. After installation I there was no increase in my oil pressure. This filter cost 4 times more than the standard Wix filter I normally use. All and all a waste of money for my application.
2,lacks specific details,"I purchased this book because I wanted to know how to set up an internet site. Although the book briefly describes the aspects necessary, it fails to provide any specific details. As well, it emphasizes Win95 instead of NT or UNIX which is the industry standard. This is only a good book if you're interested in getting an overall perspective on setting up an internet site rather than wanting to know specifically how to do it."
2,Confusing and a Chore to Read,"I recently bought this book at Borders and will be returning it first chance I get. The writing style is very ""thick"", imho, found it to be a chore to read. Only got as far as chapter 3 about domain names when I said, ""no more!""This book is not written for a novice for sure. Don't know who it's written for to be honest, but I'd avoid it."
2,Very confusing and for real dummies.,"I think this book was very confusing. It was very difficult to find things about different subjects because the index and the summary didn't give me many choices and information. And the content is only for real dummies. As I have an intermediate knowledgment of Internet, it was not very useful for me. At least the language is very friendly and easy."
3,Expensive,I bought these pencils on the recommendation of my art instructors because they blend colors very well. I also bought a box of generic pencils from Wal-Mart for about $5. I use the WM ones primarily because I didn't find a dramatic difference in the few drawings that I did.
4,My wife really likes it,"The watch may not be flashy, but she wanted functionality. She has worn it for a year now and it still looks good, still keeps good time. Some Internet watches just plain don't work well, but this one has been good to us. We love the moving bezel for timing events."
3,Sacred Hymns of the Catholic Church,"Truthfully this book is not what I thought it was. I was looking for a book of hymns, you know music sheetsthat you can use to play on a piano . It was my fault in that I assumed it was a book of music. I am returning itand I have ordered a book containing sheet music from Amazon. This book though looks like a good book forsomeone that is interested in the nuts and bolts of Catholic hymns."
4,MCXROCK,If you love Prince you will love this CD set. It has old as well as new songs and well worth the money but you need to be a fan to truly love this set.
3,Ultimate?,"Not only is this set missing the songs mentioned in other reviews, but where is ""Mountains""? Either the single or remix (which is great) should be included.It's pretty obvious that two cds aren't going to be enough to include all the great songs/remixes from Prince. If you don't already have the remixes included here, this set is worth buying."
1,"No ""Ultimate"" compilation at all! Extended versions are the worst ever!","I got this album with the idea of getting what I thought was a reasonable good compilation of Prince's greatest hits. Well... CD 1 is okay... But... What about CD 2? The 'Extended' and 'Dance Mix' versions of ""Little Red Corvette"", ""Rapsberry Beret"", ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""Kiss"" REALLY SUCK! Why to avoid the excellent, original versions? The people at Rhino made a really bad choice on issuing this awful compilation and titling it as ""ULTIMATE""!!I would prefer to return this awful ""Ultimate"" compilation, get my money back and try buying Prince albums individually!!"
4,"The Disc 2 (12"" version & mixes) is the good news","Kind of pricy, considering I'm only gonna listen to the 2nd disc (Disc 2). It's worth buying since I'm glad to hear these mixes and long versions on a disc. Most of these songs were not released in cd form, but only in vinyl format. The first disc (Disc 1) is something a Prince fan would have already... so, it's no big deal. Overall, get this cd if you're into Prince's long versions, which are cool to hear since the longer it plays, the FUNKIER it gets."
3,Good Remixes But Good Songs Left Off!,"The only advantage to this set are the remixes. As for the other songs, they can be found on earlier greatest hits releases. Also, there are several songs left off, including ""Erotic City"", ""Batdance"", ""The Most Beautiful Girl In the World"" and a few more classics. Disappointing collection. You are better off with the three disc collection release in 1995."
4,Worth it for the extended songs,"I got my copy in Canada, and it has the 17/11 track listing, although Amazon assured me theirs has the 15/14 track listing. I guess I'll have to buy one to find out.Sure, it stinks that they included edited version of songs, but this set is still worth it, for the extended versions.Personally, I already had almost all of the extended versions on vinyl, which I had transferred to disc and mp3, but it's nice to get the remastered versions, and there were actually a couple I didn't have.If you don't have the 12"" singles, or haven't ever heard these versions, you should certainly get this CD set. Great stuff!I would have given it 5 stars, but the short songs detract from the value, and so does the fact that Prince didn't even want this released, and the label is just trying to make as much off of him as they can."
2,Ultimate? Not!!!,"Warner Bros. dropped the ball big time with this one! Instead of focusing solely on the extremely-rare extended mixes of tracks which we all seek, the folks at Warners give us a full disc of stuff already released on other (or better, with regard to those edited versions) discs! The German import 12"" versions of 'Sexy Dancer' and 'Erotic City'? Not here! The 12"" versions of 'Housequake' and 'If I Was Your Girlfriend'? Not here!! The extended mix of 'Anotherloverholenyohead'? How about the extended mix of 'Irresitible B***h'? Not here!!! And I'm just scratching the surface! These releases (and many others) are much-desired, and merchants are exacting small fortunes for scratchy copies while selling on Ebay and used record stores! There are a few nice ones on here, but to call something 'Ultimate', when it clearly isn't is both inappropriate and misleading!"
3,"Ultimate, hardly...","This collection is confusing at best. While we are talking about one of the greatest artists in history, the title of this collection as ""ultimate"" is just misrepresentation. I can't really understand the criteria for the songs that were chosen, or criteria for which ones would be album length versus single length.Take disc one, put it away, get the original discs, and listen to those.The only nice thing about this collection is disc two which contains 12"" versions never on CD before.This is a commentary on the 17/11 track version. (oh yeah only more confusion)On this one WB=We Blow."
4,Prince no esta mal pero,el talento de prince es indudable pero eso de recopilar exitos y juntarlos con mixs del pasado no es bueno ya que el artista ya no pertenece a la WB pero para los fans de PRINCE este disco es de colección
1,Single versions,First of all I feel bad for all the people that have bought this disc because of all the single versions. It's like reading 3/4 of a book.There should be album version or full length versions but I guess Warner Brothers doesn't get it.I'm glad I read the reviews because I refuse to buy songs that are shortened.
5,You have to change to survive!,"If you look at most of the punk bands from the mid to late 70's, they had pretty much rode their one trick pony into the ground and were the stuff of historians by the time this album came out. I rank this album up there with the best stuff the Stranglers ever created. Why? They were able to re-create themselves into a terrific sounding New Wave band. So few groups are able to do that. I mean, look at the Stones -- they haven't written anything new since ""Tatoo You""!!OK, I'm biased because this was the album that introduced me to the Stranglers and now I love everything by them up until Hugh left. Still, ""European Female"" is one of the best songs ever!"
5,Simply Unbelievable!!!,This is by far the best albumn in my collection of over 2000 and having worked at a music store in the early 80's....I heard it all. If you think you are buying a Stranglers CD you might be disapointed. I saw this band do this albumn live and it blew me away! They have never done anything close to it before or since. It is in a class of its own. Great albumn to drive with late at night....every song flows perfectly. You gotta hear it. If you like simple driving melodies with a beat you can count on...this it it. Ok maybe Shriekback (My Spine is the bass line) is good to accompany it. I highly reccomend this timeless CD and I only wish there were more like it somewhere...
2,Thank the Lord I didn't pay FULL PRICE!,"Feline was OK, with only 3 songs that I liked. ""Golden Brown"" is an artsy but graceful and surprisingly lovely song from such a raucous group! I STRONGLY recommend ""Raven"", ""Peaches"", and ""The Best Of The Stranglers"". Skip! This! Album!"
2,Not really as advertised,"While 'Product features' leads you to believe that this thermometer is good to go up to 600 degrees, the item package carries a lengthy warning. To summarize: prolonged use over 440...could lead to cracking...remove thermometer if used at these temps. However it has a lifetime warranty! It must lead to an interesting round robin of the promised 'repair of replace at our option' between consumer and manufacturer. Why would you not want to confirm oven temps above 440? Since I bake bread and pizza etc the face plate of my thermometer seems to be crisping. Why just claim 150/600 degrees but not mean it? Why not make an adequate product?"
2,Looks good but flimsy,Protective glass cracked after first use. I emailed to the manufacturer. They haven't responded to me for two weeks now.It is waste of money!
1,Had to return,"While the thermometer is probably accurate (showed my oven at 50 degrees above set temp--which is what I suspected), I had to return it because I could find no way to attach it to my oven grate in a way that would keep it out of the way but still visible. That clip is too big: if you try to clip it to a single rod of your grate, it will flop all over the place. Standing would work temporarily but then it invariable tipped over. My husband burnt his hand trying to set the thing back upright in a readable position. Very frustrating."
3,Slow to react to changes in oven temperature.,"Like the title says... It seems to take longer than expected to show the current temperature of the oven. Otherwise, it clamps securely to the rack, appears accurate (our oven seems to be about 15 degrees off), and seems to be well made."
3,"Okay, but...","What they do not say until you actually get it, is that at temps in excess of 600 degrees it won't last. I have a commercial oven that tops out at 700, so I don't expect this thermometer to last too long."
1,It was not accurate,"I bought this and a digital thermometer to check the oven temperatures because cookies were not coming out right. When my oven display said 400 deg. this thermometer read 450. The Maverick digital thermometer showed the oven temp varying about 20 to 30 degrees above or below the temperature I set. When I opened the door the digital thermometer showed a drop of 30 deg. instantly. When I closed the oven, it showed the temperature overshooting the set temperature by 20 to 30 deg. I returned the Taylor thermometer. It did not give me an accurate reading, always being 50 degrees above the set temperature."
5,Know your oven!,My oven is a Maytag. I've had nothing but trouble with it since I bought it three years ago. It is an inferior product and is apparently a subsidiary of Whirlpool. The temperature never seemed quite right and the cheap little thermometer I bought at Target just didn't do the trick. This thrmometer is accurate and I've finally been able to figure out my oven's temp. and the fact that it gradually wanders up to ten degress above the temp I set. I highly recommend this item.
3,Wife's Delight,The oven thermostat was not reaching the desired temperatures. We have a mercury gauge but it is too hard to read. The Taylor is really easy to read but with a mechanical vs mercury sensor not quite as acurate. It does the job we wanted. We are delighted to have made the purchase. We have since readjusted the ovens thermostat. We now have great cookies. All is wonderful here except our State's and National economy.
4,Bonanza on IPOD,I tried this product and it works really well. I was able to transfer the videos straight to my IPOD. I watch them all the time an there isn't any problems with sound or picture.
2,Only 3 letters!?!?,"I thought this would go over the entire alphabet (Hence the title ""Learning Letters"") and my daughter loves Elmo, so I bought it, however after watching the video for 20 minutes we were still only on the letter ""A"". I thought ""How are they going to finish the rest of the alphabet in 40 minutes?"" Well, we continued watching and the letter ""I"" was talked about for 20 minutes then the letter ""J"" for 20 minutes. WHERE IS THE REST OF THE ALPHABET?!?! The entire alphabet was named at the end of the video for about 5 minutes. What a waste of money. Not what I expected at all."
3,NOT the whole alphabet,"Like the other reviewers, I bought this DVD thinking it was the whole alphabet. IT IS NOT! It is only the letters A, J, and I. As stated before me, it does say the whole alphabet at the end as the credits roll. And my son and I say the letters along with the TV and while it's not the whole video, it is entertaining.If you understand all of that when buying it, you will be very pleased!That said, my son LOVES this DVD. In fact, that's why I am here. I bought mine in a store, but am buying another one to replace our old, worn out one and thought that I would leave a quick review."
2,Really only 3 letters!,"My son likes watching the episode about i. It is really disappointing that this video doesn't have clips for the whole alphabet. I'm missing old school sesame street. It is difficult finding good DVD's covering the entire alphabet, but it is worse when the title is misleading. However what I dislike the most is the mandatory previews at the beginning and if one can find their remote control pressing play brings one right back to the previews."
4,The Circle,"Just when you start to wonder where this movie is going, it surprises you with an incredibly abstract ending within a very contrasting traditional setting."
4,Great Reference book.,"This is a great book for any hardcore Star Wars fan. It shows the galaxy's history, from the Old Republic and the birth of the Sith, to the Empire, to the most modern days of the republic. The writing tended to have a good, text bookish feel, and the entire thing felt very well researched and well designed. The pictures were nothing special, but they did show me what a K-wing looked like for the first time, and they matched the text reasonably well. The authors were even willing to sit through the Koornacht Cluster Trilogy to write this book, which can either be taken as dedication above and beyond, or sheer stupidity. If you aren't the greatest Star Wars fan in the world than you might want to try another book, but for the person who wants to know everything this is great."
4,A much needed book.,The books is a cool addition to any StarWars library. It is nice having a full history from 1 source.
3,the Essential Guide to KJA books.,"I felt as though this was not much more than a guide to KJA's SW books. I have never really been impressed with Mr Anderson's work, but I bought the book because I thought it would help me out with the stuff I haven't read.It was EXTREMELY vague on the X-Wing comics. It didn't devote much time to the Thrawn Trilogy. And TPM didn't even warrant the twenty pages KJA spent on is Jedi comics. He spent more time on his books than he did on the movies combined.Yes, there are more KJA books than there are movies, but the movies are the backbone of the SW universe.All in all, with his concentrating mostly on his work, and just skimming over the rest of the SW universe and EU, he produced an close-to-adequete(?) guide book."
4,The original chronology guide,"The original chronology guide to Star Wars, showing time lines and how different events were linked and affected each other. Recommended for Star Wars scholars or collectors."
1,Memoirs are popular these days!,"Freddie Mae Baxter is a character, but whether or not she is a very interesting character, and if her life is of interest to anyone else, is a matter of opinion. This book was awfully hyped-up (big article in The NY Times a few weeks ago), but it's basically very lightweight. No great insights, no depth,no interesting reflection on its times, and no great charm (in my opinion, this lady is not even particularly likeable, sorry!) In general, it's a huge bore. Memoirs are a popular format these days, but why a publisher deemed this manuscript worthy of publishing is beyond me. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no here here."
5,Thoughts and Stories of a Delightful Woman,"I first saw Freddie Mae on Rosie O'Donnell. I thought she was an interesting ""character"". I throughly enjoyed this book. Freddie Mae tells us about her life growing up in the South and moving North to New York. She has some stories to tell! She tells it like it is. She made me laugh! The book is light, easy reading. I would love to talk with Freddie Mae. This is a book I would recommend as a gift."
4,So Far So GOod,"I have not finished this book,but what I read so far is very good. No, she wasn't famous but so what? Neither were the Delany sisters, but they became famous after all. We need these folks history because she is of a generation that are dying daily. There are only so many of us who could tell first hand about WW2, much less the Depression. I don't care if she is likeable or not, her story needs to be told...So far, it's alright by me."
4,Life is what you what you make of it,"Growing up in 1930s South Carolina, Freddie Mae Baxter was the youngest of eight children in a poor and fatherless family.Nonetheless, Baxter's charming recollections indicate a happy life, full of simple pleasures, needs and desires. Life was slower-paced, and no one seemed to want much to be content. Lacking many material possessions, families were closer, and friends were for life.In the '40s, young Freddie Mae moved to New York, hoping for a better life. She ended up spending the next few decades in a succession of domestic jobs, and although she never married, she loved and provided richly for nieces, nephews, and neighborhood children.In addition to bits and pieces of Baxter's past, this collection of vignettes also offers her thoughts on a variety of subjects, including family relationships, social evils, and her love for music.This quick, quirky read will leave an impression upon readers for some time to come."
3,"not as exciting as I thought, but good","Miss Freddie Mae Baxter might have a lucky life, but I thought she would have had a more positive spiritual outlook. I was not warmed by a lady who seemed to take pride in not going to church and playing at Atlantic City. She does make some excellent points about family. I think most people will benefit from reading the book."
4,"PRETTY GOOD, EXCEPT. . .","THIS CD IS VERY GOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE VERSION OF UNCHAINED MELODY ON IT. INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION, THEY INCLUDED THE RE RELEASED NEW STEREO VERSION. I MYSELF PREFER THE ORIGINAL. STILL, THE OTHER SONGS ARE GOOD. -PETER A."
5,Very watermelon flavored!,I love all of Joray's flavors. Watermelon is my favorite! Joray's fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks.
4,Piglet's BIG movie - a BIG hit,"This is a great movie for kids. Our 3.5yr and 22 month old take great delight in watching this over and over again! The great news is, the adults are not yet tired of it. The story is entertaining, the music and songs are delightful and compared to other Pooh movies, it is by far the most engaging and well produced. It is a firm family favourite and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely movie, with good humour, great animation, brilliant music. Buy it and push play!"
5,Love it!,"My 2 year old daughter loves this movie and I've been enjoying it too. I like that the movie has a more modern feel, but the animation doesn't feel too, ""digital"" like some of the more modern Pooh movies I've seen. Carley Simon's songs fit nicely as well."
5,Excellent Disney Movie!,"When we first viewed this movie at home, I decided to put it away for a few months because my then 4-year-old cried because Piglet's memory book fell in the river.Aside from that one incident, my kinds love to watch this movie over and over again.Disney does it again; another excellent movie."
5,My honey loves it!,"I have a five month old that loves this movie! We think it's great too, and the Carly Simon songs are so much fun. It's nice to see animation for kids that isn't ""geared towards adults"" too. We can appreciate that genre, but the little ones need more time to be little ones..."
3,Cute movie for Winnie-the-Pooh lovers,"My twin girls liked this, but they got a little tired of it about halfway through. They love Pooh bear the best, so maybe it's because the focus was on Piglet. Overall, a cute little movie for the kids."
5,So cute,Winnie the Poo is timeless. I have 3 boys ages 2-6 and they all loved this movie. My 3.5 even asks for it by name! This is Piglet's movie and it is a cute movie. Its a long movie too but it keeps their interest. Mommy and daddy will like the songs. Only drawback from this movie is now my kids want cookies before bed. Thanks Kanga!
5,Great service and product,"Seller was courteous and very prompt with my order, and I was absolutely thrilled with the movie, There was absolutely nothing wrong with the video and we enjoyed it immensely. I would definitely use this seller again! Thanks!"
1,Inappropriate near-death scene at the end+ mostly flashbacks,"Hi! This is my first review, and I was moved to write it because I felt so strongly against this film. I'll write positive reviews of other things later!This was the first movie I took my son, then 2, to see. I purposely avoided any movie that could possibly have something too scary or violent (I thought).What completely shocked me was a scene near the end where for a short period of time the rest of the gang believes that Pooh and Piglet have fallen to their deaths down a waterfall! It is only about 10 seconds (longer than it sounds), but plenty of time for the gang to begin MOURNING, and for any kid to believe that they are dead! Huh?I was very disappointed already by then. Most of the movie consisted of flashbacks - which I assume were from previous animations? - which made me feel cheated.I should admit that I am not a Disney fan, but I was ready to enjoy it, really!"
2,This Movie Could Have Been Great!!,I am giving 1 star for the plot and 1 star for some of the funny/witty lines.When good movies go bad:WEAK soundtrack. Boring songs with stupid lyrics.50% of the movie is flash backs to previous films. I would have been fine with the flashbacks if they weren't to movies already made.Not enough time was spent on Piglet (the star) in 'real time' he appeared in flashbacks for 90% of the film.Overall it did have a good plot and message. If you mute all of the tedious Carly Simon songs and have never seen any previous Pooh stories you will like it.
2,Maybe I watched it on a bad day,"Well, I haven't seen the original Pooh cartoons since I was a kid... but I'm pretty sure they weren't quite as crack-induced as this movie. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty darn weird is a subtle, surreal sort of way.Watch it. Have fun. Don't let your kids see it too many times. It might mess 'em up a bit."
2,"Carly Simon commercial is vain, no?","This movie is MUCH better than the Tigger one (which is not saying much), but neither can hold a candle to the first movie/series of shorts.I also have to say the ""bonus"" addition of a Carly Simon video at the end of the movie was a bit vain or at least annoying."
4,Piglet is a Big Hit,"This is fun entertainment for both young and old alike. It revisits some of Milne's original stories (even if perfectionists will note that Eyore appears in the story before he's introduced in the book). The music was absolutely wonderful, moving the story very well--can't wait to get the soundtrack. The animation is great and the way each individual story is interwoven with the main story is very skillful. Children will enjoy this film, but it will have a laugh for the ""older kids"" (adults)too. It seemed to be a bit long for younger children (3-year olds), but held well for the others. The younger ones got wiggly! Can't wait for the video."
5,Sweet and funny film,"We took our two and a half year old daughter to this movie, her first ever! She sat through it no problem, as did all the other kids I could see. It was sweet, engaging and showed little ones that they can do big things. The themes of the importance of friendship and not taking someone for granted were gently woven throughout."
5,LOVE IT!!,My son Loves this movie!! He laughs and laughs. It is a great movie for children to help learn and understand not to take friends for granet. Cute songs too!
5,Lost Piglet by Brian K.,"Piglet's friends go on a honey harvest & say he is to small to help.Thenthey get chased by the bees. And worse, Piglet dissapers. His friends try to find him with a scrapbook for a map. It's called The Book of Memories.Based on the book by A.A Milne."
3,"so-so,it's kinda hard on the eyes","this movie is kinda like the care bears movie in that it is for kids ages 2-5.me, i'm 11,so i guess i'm too old.watching this movie was enough to make me think that ''boy, little kids must really like this stuff...''in the eyes of a 3-year old,this movie must be what the matrix reloaded is to adults.i thought the movie was ok but not great.i would rather reccomand spirited away instead of this."
1,Disappointed!,I was unable to play this DVD Piglet's Big Movie [Region 2]. I failed to notice that Region 2 DVD's only play in the UK!My fault. Yet I was so disappointed for my 4 yr. old grandson who would have loved it.
3,Carly's Big Movie?,"I've been a fan of the gang from the Hundred Acre Wood since early childhood, and I keep hoping these new Pooh movies will help me recapture a bit of that childhood.Sadly, this one, like the last several, manages to spoil wonderful characters with an excess of singing.I don't hate Carly Simon, but I certainly wouldn't recommend any movie on the strength of her soundtrack, especially when that soundtrack is as obtrusive as this one.My heart won't let me give up on Pooh, but just once before I die I'd love to see a story like those of old: More in the spirit of A. A. Milne than an animated musical."
5,great product for kids and adults,"These are so quality, not like the cheap colored pencils you buy at the stores for kids....these put beautiful color on the paper...not just on the pencil! The popular brands look good but don't transfer the color the paper frustrating both kids and adults."
5,Gift for Angel Tree recipient...,I use these products myself and have for years...What better way to introduce a budding artist than with bettertools than they are accustomed to ?
5,United Live Worship - the best!,"As a worship leader I am always looking for fresh, new worship music. United Live hit me. It's probably the best Worship CD I have bought, from the first to last track. Has a great youth-band feel, and is well led by Reuben Morgan and team. Once again, good job Hillsongs."
2,"No answer sheet, no nothing.","Since the answer sheet wasn't included, I could not check the answers by my self, and waste my time searching up online. If you're looking for a book with an answer sheet or answer booklet, then this is the worst book because it does not have it."
3,Beware this issue!!!,"Great concert, BUT be careful if you are looking at the ""new"" tracks listed. This is just the 2nd Hunter College concert - the same as other issues, BUT unlike most of the others (eg Tomato), many of the tracks do not use the same titles as used in all the standard Hooker discographies. So, if you have vols 1 & 2, don't be tempted as I was into thinking it is perhaps a 3rd bunch!!! It's just a standard Vol 2. (The Vol 1 issue by Blues Alliance is also just the normal Vol 1, but tracks are named like all other issues)."
1,"sure, if you like the taste of sulfer dioxide.","product highly NOT recommended. all i could taste was the sulfur dioxide. my daughter took a case to school for a party pass out, they all ended up in the trash can. it was quite the let down for her. i'm sure if they left out the sulfur dioxide and replaced it with lemon juice or a citric acid this product would become a top seller."
2,Taste like candy not fruit,"I was very disappointed with these fruit rolls. I am a big fan of the Mariani fruit rolls (also available on Amazon), but thought I'd give these a try for variety. They are no where near as good as the Marianis. They don't taste like raspberry at all. Its just a sickeningly sweet candy flavor (and I normally LOVE candy!). The consistency is very tough and plastic-y, making them hard to chew. I strongly recommend buying the Mariani fruit rolls instead of these. The Marianis are even cheaper!"
4,Worth The Wait,"I patiently waited out many Amazon ""order delays"" figuring the book had a high order rate after the movie was released. Finally arrived about a week ago. The book is very well written and gives a great amount of detail on this slightly ""odd"" but determined fellow. I have not seen the movie yet as it came and went in our town in about one week. The one character flaw that shows up for Mr. Munro is that in the pursuit of his goal he seemed to forget he had a family. Worth the read. Could use some more pictures......"
3,David Tudor,"Despite where it says above, ""Audio CD/Number of Discs: 1"", rest assured that Lovely Music would never charge you 30 dollars for only one disc. This is in fact a double-disc set. I can't recommend it very highly though, because the music failed to hold my attention. It just seemed a bit too long for so little variety. I recommend something more textured from Mr. Tudor, like ""Rainforest"" on Mode."
3,A mixed bag,"Of the 3 novels here, Fifth Business is a fascinating, sort of rococo blend of characters (tycoons, magicians, hagiographers, hoboes, etc.). To me, it suffers from the claustrophobic mindset of the narrator, but no question it is well worth reading. World of Wonders is a luxuriant fantasy--the weird twists and turns of fate that produce the magician of Fifth Business--but again the eye you see it all through is dark and wordly-wise, fairly cynical, and you begin to suspect this is Davies' one and only voice. There's some to-do with an ogre-heiress which is tiresome. Still, both Fifth Business and World of Wonders have more than enough intricate storytelling to enthrall you, probably, for a while. The Manticore, however, is a terrible novel. It never should have been printed on its own (was it, in fact?). Who can take this dialogue with a Swiss psychoanalyst (an attractive woman, no less) seriously? It is a torture to plod through. 4 stars for the other two novels, 1 for Manticore."
2,very disappointing...,"I am a long-time fan of John Irving, and gave Robertson Davies a try...not worth the time to slog through, boring, won't read any of his others. I'll stick with Irving!"
2,Going somewhere?,"I can keep this short: I came away ultimately disappointed after making it most of the way through the second book because, simply, the story never really went anywhere. The writing was vivid and interesting, but the story was lacking. Not worth my time to continue on. There's too many other good books out there. Sorry Davies!"
5,It doesn't get much better,"Davies is one of the best writers living or dead. I read the trilogy one, two, three. The second was a bit slow and I missed some of the characters from the first. But the second is a necessary read and only the lesser by comparison to the other two. The third wraps it up and leaves you satisfied. Davies novels are not a short read, but are always well worth the time."
3,"Read the Fifth Bussiness, but skip the rest","If you ask me to rank each part of this trilogy seperately, i would give the Fifth Business a 5 Star, The Manticore a 2 star and World of Wonders simply one star. Davies' obsession with Jung makes Manticore rather pretencious and unbearably monotonous to read. For the case of World of Wonders, its creation and value, in my opinion, might only rest on the romantic idea of the completion of a triology, which is a thing that Davies loves to do but failes to do well."
5,Life as a mythic adventure,"How interesting that other reviewers like THE MANTICORE least of the books of the Deptford Trilogy. It is my favorite of the three, and its introduction to Jungian psychology actually offers the reader a sort of decoder key to the other two books. Taken together, the trilogy shows how even the most mundane aspects of our lives have meaning, and illustrates the paradox of how, within the context of our own free will, we live the lives we're supposed to."
5,"Great sound! Listen to the clips, and buy this!","Never heard of them before I heard the clips on Amazon. I really like their music! Listen to the clips, and buy it!"
4,pretty good,"I like the album a lot. I have been a fan of the Detroit cobras for a few years now, and though I dont think any of their albums will top ""Baby"" this one comes pretty close. Typical of the cobras good energy and great vocals."
3,A step down,"Lacking the urgency of 'Baby' and 'Life, Love and Leaving' the Cobras are still the best at reconstructing forgotten R&B gems into fiery garage rockers."
4,Retro music that pleases,"This is not easy listening music, so if you like what you hear on the elevator, this CD would not be to your taste. On the other hand, if music with a raw edge appeals, then check this one out."
3,Worth every cent I paid!,"I was at a meeting the other day, and wanted to put in my two cents. But on checking the contents of my pocket, I realized that I didn't have two cents to share. Thanks to Amazon.com, that's not a problem anymore!"
4,"Very good, despite the minor errors","I agree that there are a few obvious errors and that it wasn't proofread as well as it should have been; considering that this is New Riders IS surprising.However, as a highly experienced 6.5 admin, I'm still glad I bought this one because it gets right to the point on all you need to know about version 7's exam. Despite the minor errors, I still stand behind New Riders all the way.There is no such thing as a completely error-free study guide, which is why we should all be thankful for things like publishers errata Web sites, newgroups, and (of course) Amazon.com"
3,"An overview only, not enough for exam","You can have this book an introduction to SQL 7 if you are new to version 7. Its coverage cannot lead you even to a bare pass. You DEFINITELY need other resources for your exam. Finished this book and conducted a Transcender test, wow... poor, I know how much did I get from this book."
5,Great Sound & Value - Small Size,"Surprisingly good sound for such small speakers. A warm sounding small room speaker - very good treble and mid range, Very nice looking with quality connections and construction.Ideal for a bedroom, office or den or as rear surrounds in home theatre situation when you don't want large ""look at me"" speakers. I used a pair as my main L-R channels for two years until my partner agreed to let me go larger. Highly recommended."
4,"La Joan, still a star","The Handel section of this recording suffers from the disadvantage of being blurred and fogged by poor recording that resulted from being from a live (or pirated) performance. But on the other hand, the Rossini with Monica Sinclair is stupendious. Sutherland pulls all the stops in this music and treats us to a fireworks display of sensational singing that only she could muster. At this point her voice is still facile and rich, that rare combination that only she could toss off almost on a whim. The recording is worth the technical problems. Warren Taylor"
5,Finally Originality,"Finally an artist rather than just a singer. Jennifer writes her own music and it doesn't sound like everything else that's been done a million times over. She is very interesting, expressive and unique. Her voice completly matches the music, and both her voice and the music are very pleasing to the ear. This is the kind of music you can listen to actively and while doing other things. Her music allows one to wander in fantasy and relax. It's very soothing but yet not elevatorish. Everyone who enjoys great original Etehreal/New Age music should definitly check out this CD! Even those who have never ventured into Alternative music and are curious and/or just plain tired of listening to all the same music should listen to Jennifer Hope."
2,Waste of money,"If you like reality TV or soap operas, this DVD is right up your alley. Jamie is indeed informative and amusing during his cooking shows. I guess I expected something like that from this DVD."
5,This guy is histerical!,"My wife bought this and we watched it over the weekend, and I was looking here to see what other people thought of it and I can't believe no one has said how funny Jamie is. When he's not being ravaged with business decisions and dealing with personal issues, Jamie seems like a great down to earth guy. He had me cracking up quite a few times. I wasn't sure if I'd like this show as I had only seen his Naked Chef show a few times and I wasn't that excited about it. But this was great. I can't believe his resturaunt ever opened with these kids. They start out not knowing anything he turns them into hard working chefs. It's really amazing.I don't know what to compare this show to but it's a reality series thats for sure. But not like other ones you've seen really. It's a lot more personal than other shows like it I think. I had a great time watching it and I think you will too."
1,Waste of money at any price,"Looking at this product I thought it would offer great and different relaxation techniques,...wrong. Throughout almost the entire dvd Petrone talked and talked and talked. She talked about the ""method"" (while sitting still in a chair looking at a camera), she talked to actors about the ""method"" (who were all sitting still in chairs as if waiting for tea), and she talked about her injury. By the time Petrone finally got around to showing the ""method"" I wanted to throw this kit away. The healing techniques only lasted about 10 min., each lasting 3-5 min. on their own while Petrone talked and walked around the relaxing actors with the camera following her for the most part.Don't waste your money just get a yoga dvd/kit or something. And if you want something that doesn't require you bending over backwards and hitting the back of your head on your heels... try the Just My Size Yoga dvd."
5,worth the work,I have had 4 back surgeries and 12 different physical therapists. I agree that if you are not diligent you will not get the benefits intended from this. I can say that even not diligent it has helped me with acute pain. The dvd is not produced well but the information is worth sifting through. You determine what you want from the program from what you put in. There is no easy cure. It requires 1 hour a day to really improve. However there is much less sweat than a work out program for the same amount of time. Even not putting in the hours I have found temporary relief using it.
3,This sharpener works fine for awhile . . .,"but as with any sharpener the mechanism wears down. This item says ""cutterheads on heavily used sharpeners should be replaced every 2-3 years."" I pictured ""heavily used"" as being used in a large classroom, however after 2 years ours wore out with only 6 people using it almost daily. You can buy a replacement cutterhead (no. 51151) here at Amazon for around $11 or $12. The key to a nicely sharpened pencil? Make sure that the pencil fits snugly into the proper-sized hole. If the fit is too loose, the pencil will sharpen unevenly. The standard-sized hole isn't always the best one to use."
2,They don't make them like they used to,My parents have one of these that is 40 years old and works fine so I bought one. Unfortunately the mechanism is sloppy and the grinding blades get jammed in the drive gears. It seems like the company would have mastered the design of this simple machine. i think there has been too much cost cutting.
4,"Old time quality, almost","I used one of these as a child at school. Great product, only problem was the hole for the pencil was on the bottom instead of the top. Sided of shaving cover was assembled incorectly. Instead of sending it back, just took it apart and flipped the side of the cover.Works great now and just like I remembered. They just need better quality control."
4,Gringo with a Family from Cali,"This is the best single compilation of songs relating to Cali, Colombia. Some are old, some are new but all are very enjoyable for listening."
4,Well done for a beginner's book...,"Great book with detailed but simple info on parts of the instrument, tuning, and the little tidbits that a beginner needs to know. It also explains scales, down-up picking, chords, how to read tabs, and progresses through harder songs.Lacking is an audio CD with examples of the runs and tunes that are in the book. That would make it a 10 instead of a 9."
1,No music for Kindle Edition,"I advise against getting the Kindle version because there is no source for the music tracks referenced in the book. The print version comes with a CD. I would think that there would be an online version of the music, but that does not appear to be the case. If there is a source for the music, I would like know. Barring that I feel that I did not get the full product, and I am totally unsatisfied with this purchase."
2,You said there was tab. Where's the tab?,"For a slim (61 page) beginner's book a good amount of ground is covered, and in the very beginning (""notes on the first string"" ""notes on the second string"") there IS tablature notation, but then -- as you reach the actual songs, no tab. If you can't read standard notation music then you're strumming back-up; the good news is that it does offer some variety of 'chord voicings' -- ie; you can play a ""G"" like this, like this, or like this... which is good, the back-up playing has some variation -- so two stars for that, but if the book says ""music and tablature"" on the cover, I expect some tablature.It's a bit like a really cute but unpleasantly violent kitten. You can't give it only one star; but I can't go any higher than two."
5,My favorite brand for colored pencils!,These colored pencils are wonderfully smooth and rich in color. They are great for working on black paper as well! I'm very happy with my purchase. Shipping went fast and without any problems.
2,Poor quality control,"One color was missing, another color was provided in duplicate. One may think 23 of 24 isn't too bad, but then, why did you try to buy 24 colors?"
5,"Beautiful, vivid colors!","I purchased this set for my daughter and was very impressed with the quality of the pencils and the depth of the colors. My only tiny complaint is that the tin container, while very well made, comes apart pretty easily, meaning if you turn it upside down, the top might come off, spilling the pencils (this happened to me). Amazon is definitely the place to buy these - I found the exact same set in a local hobby store for more than twice the price!"
2,Not Very happy,"I am sorry I bought this particular brand, they are not quality and so far every pencil I have used has broken color stick, it keeps falling out of the wood casing as you sharpen, either these were badly abused in transit or they just are not very well made."
3,Nice but...,"These pencils are very nice... And the price is decent compared to how much they cost in Art stores... however when I opened the box, one of the pencils was cracked and the lead was broken. It really wasn't worth sending them back and waiting another 2 weeks to receive more. Heard this is the case a lot of times. Wish the company did a better job of making sure that all pencils are not cracked and delivered carefully."
5,These pencils are great,"I love these pencils. They are great and soo smooth. the only problem I have is that they don't come sharpened out of the box. Also the color selection is very limited, so if you need more color I recommend a larger set. Also a blender and the verithing set are a must if you want to get more detail from you work."
1,if you are cheap and never use colored pencils and just buy this for its name...,"this is made by Sanford a mediocre if that company that makes pens and what not of low grade quality and thus this speaks for all their lines of products. you could get better quality using using a crayola wax pencil. if you like leads that have no pigment, breaks too easily and you are just a sucker for what was never a good idea in the first place but somehow got too much recognition and the name excites you, well here you go, throw your money away"
5,Nine years old girl satisfied,I bought these colors for my daughter and since that has not stopped drawing and coloring very pleased with the results
5,nice colors,great colors that blend very easy. just mix two colors and you creat a third one. soft pencils...don't need to press at all like cheap pencilsNote: they brake a little bit when you need to sharp them but still are super for my 4 years old daugther.
4,Moby-Unplugged,"While this is not an acoustic album, most ""Unplugged"" albums are the artists' at their most basic, Play:The B Sides is Moby stripped-down to mostly instrumental music, basic,simple, pure and beautiful. A rare collection that is great to listen to in the car, at home, or on head phones."
3,not complete!,"ok ok this is a very nice little collection of b sides from the Play album BUT where is the song Princess from the Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad single? It's fantastic and admittedly it's not as ""ambient"" as most of the songs on this album but if it were included at the end it would be a great uplifting way to close this collection. Just my opinion."
3,"Good background music, but kinda bland","While I can't say this is awful, its just not engaging enough to engender a reaction that powerful, I can't recommend this either. It's good background music but there really isn't enough going on to make Play: The B Sides an album I can sit down and listen to. Its not boring, nor is it that interesting, rather it pleasantly burbles along like your dotty aunt Marge who doesn't care if you're listening to her or not. Mild and disengaged."
5,"Moby's ""Play - B Sides""","Great CD for any Moby fan who likes his mellow tunes. Not as good as his ""18 - B Sides"", but still nice cruisin' music. Great for driving."
4,"Not as good as Play, but still a good album","Play is a 5 star album. This one has some really good tracks and goes well with Play. ""Memory Gospel"" is one of the best songs on there."
5,Absolutely beautiful !,"A ""B Side"" is like this. A record and cassette tape has an A SIDE and a B SIDE to it. The B Side tracks are simply the other side of the album (CD) where you can hear everything that the artist didn't think was appropiate for the original debut of the album. To think of it in a easier way, they are tracks that were suppose to make it to the album, but never did. I am still a little confused as to why he re-released this since it was already made as an IMPORT, but it was nice considering I can get it for a nice, cheap price...It's a great buy though since the re-release. The B Sides were a completely different adventure as to what the Original 'Play' brought you. The music was very inspirational and it just goes to show you what Moby can really do to make beautiful music (Ex. Go). This is a DEFINITE album to own for Moby fans."
5,Thy Brother's Reaper,"What a rush! Turn a great writer's imagination loose and this is what happens, you get ""Thy Brother's Reaper."" I couldn't turn the pages fast enough with this brilliantly crafted thriller. Don't pick this book up if you have things to do, you won't be able to put it down! This author knows how to keep you captivated and beware--when you think you have it all figured out........ Try to imagine a world where your absolute existance depends on your ""trusted"" government and then think along the lines of ""global catastrophe."" Humans in diguise, innocent victims being mutilated, drinking water contaminated, religious freedom revoked, perfection-""the key to life""--you have to read this for yourself it won't be the same if I tell you. If your not a fan of this author, you will be now! Nan Hayes once again leaves me realing in the aftermath of yet another masterpiece."
4,Recipes from the House of Cash,Enjoyed this book - haven't tried any of the recipes yet but there's a lot I am going to try.
1,missing,"Amazon never tried to solve the problem I told them about. I ordered this as a present to my wife, but I never recieved it.th myrsethmolde norway"
4,power surge,"works well so far for the purpose, have to push it into outlet as it gets weighted down, but this hasnt been a major problem."
4,Saved My Computer,"The Globe surge protector worked as promised. Saved one computer, two printers, and one cordless telephone charger. Of course, it's fried and needs to be replaced. The only change to the Globe would be to invert the plugs. The ground plug hole should be located on the top and the plug on the back of the unit should be plugged into the top plug of a dual outlet to provide stability since it does fall out of the wall outlet with the current design."
2,"Plug it in, it falls out.","Unfortunately, I've had the same problem as other users. Plugging and unplugging devices from this unit will knock it out of the wall socket."
4,Perfect to increase outlets,This is perfect for anyone that doesn't have enought outlets. I like the fact that is swivels.
5,A great alternative to the outlet strip and the squid,Different surges for different uses. This is perfect for when you don't want outlet strips all over the place. I like the pivot feature on the outlets as well. One problem- its heavy and may fall out of outlet easily
4,very good,really loved this product works great and hols six plugs so for now way of living and came fast keep up the great work!! jean
5,Great Item to Have Handy,"I recently ordered 3 of these to have available. One of my daughters just move into a typical apt. in Manhattan with a kitchen the size of a tiny bathroom. Needing outlets, she was thrilled when I sent her one of these. Just the other day I had to have my cable box replaced. The new one needed an outlet where I didn't have any more that could handle a transformer-type plug. I reached for my second device and, presto, all was well. It takes up so little space and can handle multiple transformer plugs which is necessary these days. Even the cable guy was impressed and asked where I purchased it and you have to assume he has seen them all. The price at Amazon is excellent by the way."
2,Like the Tower of Pisa,"one cannot fix the lean. Once you plug something in, the entire outlet leans away from the wall. I've had mine just over one year and now the plastic ""support"" prong has broken off. I would love to contact the manufacturer, but I can't find it on the internet. If someone knows how to contact them, please post it."
1,Useless!,"Good idea, but useless. As soon as you actually plug anything into it, the device leans forward away from the wall and loses connectivity with the outlet!"
4,Pretty awesome - just wish you could secure it,"I purchased two of these Swivel Surge Taps for my home for outlet extensions and they're great. The only problem I've had so far is that they do tend to lean forward a bit, and even the smallest tug from whatever's plugged into the socket can cause the entire unit to become unplugged. This could have been resolved by a simple long screw into the outlet itself, but that's not an option unfortunately.Barring accidental disconnection, this is a pretty neat product, and I would buy it again."
3,Interesting film noir that never really grips,"Graham Greene's intriguing novel had it's setting changed to World War II America and its plot altered to radiate a fashionable patriotic theme. Ladd plays a solitary assassin who becomes involved in a scheme to manufacture poison gas to the enemy. His employers set him up and Ladd then seeks revenge. What might have been a really terse thriller is slowed down by musical interludes, and a romantic sub-plot between Robert Preston and Veronica Lake. The World War II elements of the plot have not dated well. Outstanding photography by John Seitz (Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard) and an interesting performance from Laird Cregar as a conniving traitor who abhors violence and favors treachery and double cross are some of the plus aspects of this film."
2,Cheesy overrated mixed bag of blessings,"Alan Ladd just doesn't work as a psychopathic, cold blooded killer. The weird plot about nasty billionaires selling poisoned gas to the Japanese during world war 2 cranks along, and one second after a character exits a door we hear a car drive off at speed - this is carrying damatic convention a tad too far. Robert Preston does his best and Veronica Lake is sweet. One to see for its curiosity value but not one to own."
3,Don't Cross Your Hired Gunman,"THIS GUN FOR HIRE(1942)---Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Laird Cregar, Robert Preston, Tully Marshall.Ladd's first major role and his first pairing with Veronica Lake. Ladd is the ""gun for hire"" who is out for revenge after being double-crossed by Cregar. This film is often cited as one of the ""great"" film noirs---it's good, it's noir, but I don't know that I would call it ""great---be that as it may, it definitely belongs in any respectable noir collection."
5,This Gun is a Goodie,"A very good film, and with very slightly better direction and a bit more depth to the bit parts it would have been up there with Casablanca among the great black and white films of the early '40s. As it is, it seems to have become almost forgotten. I'd never seen it before, and those who'd told me about it didn't seem wildly enthusiastic. Seeing it was therefore a very pleasant surprise. It zips along at a great pace; the story is intricate and exciting, yet easy to follow, and keeps you guessing, although you know it's all going to work out ok in the end. Basically, it's telling you that everyone, even hitmen with traumatized childhoods, just have to pull together in the war effort. Ladd and Lake are terrific, sharply defined and individual characters, with strongly unusual personalities --- especially Lake. Don't believe those negative reviews: they're in denial. This is an entertaining film."
4,Classic Film Noir,If you like film noir and Alan Ladd this is a tough film to beat. Classic Ladd action and romance. It is too bad he wasn't able to make more films.
5,Porter Rockwell: a Biography,The author is one I enjoy reading. He weaves an interesting story and one sees the human side of a man with a reputation of violence. The subject of the book was a modern day Samson!
4,Great choice for history lovers!,"I purchased this book for my dad who had an interest in learning more about Porter Rockwell. He really enjoyed the book! He said it was very interesting to read and very informative. The only downside was the length. This book is HUGE. It's a whole lot of reading... But if you like history and like to read, highly recommended!!!"
2,Nationalism from Newfoundland,"I don't know why I expected to read about the way of life in small Newfoundland communities, but I certainly didn't expect to read about the nationalist dreams of the people of the Avalon peninsula. This may be a good topic for a book, actually, but it would have to be better organized and more clear in its purpose than this aimless memoir. The main problem is that the author constantly laments Newfoundland's loss of independance, but never explains how or why Newfoundlanders would be better off as an independant country, or, failing that, why we should care."
2,This is not the history of naturalism that I had hoped for.,"This was a little dull. It is a history about naturalism, but it does not have the History Channel quality for quality educational. I would not suggest anyone buy this."
2,Lame.,Pretty lame video. Not much in it. Forget about it.The DVD was so bad it really isn't worth writing a review. Sorry. Buy at your own risk.
3,Will,"Good music, if you like really dark-industrial type of music. I could do without the ugly shouting vocals though. . ."
1,Great French Press - Poor Customer Service,"I own the 4 Cup Melior. It's a beautifully designed French Press from what used to be Bodem's high-end line. Unfortunately, the beaker cracked and it is not interchangeable with a standard Bodum beaker. When I phoned Bodum for a replacement, I was told they don't supply beakers for designs that are no longer in production. This is terrible customer service considering that sooner or later a glass beaker will crack."
5,Good Pencil,This pencil feels solid and of good quality. It has a twist eraser that can be easily replaced. The led is easily accessed by removing the eraser cap and just putting the led in. The grip is supportive and easy to hold. Over all good product.
2,Not as Advertised -,"The pencil is attractive but more bulky than I had imagined. However, the advertisement states that the Papermate PhD Mechanical Pencil, #67002, is retractable, which it definitely is not! I had intended to carry this pencil with me in my purse and not have the lead exposed but alas, not to be! Guess I'll have to just use it at my desk and hopefully someone else will like it and I'll start looking for a real retractable pencil."
3,"Not trust the picture above, Great customer service.","In the photo that was show above, it was a brown basket fulled with burts bees products. When I got it, it was a small box of burts bees products, not what I have order. They took it back with no problem. It was a pleasure doing business with them."
3,Nothing like it looks,"In the picture, it shows that it comes in a basket. Mine did not. With the basket, it makes it look like the product is bigger, but it's pretty tiny. It is good product, but I wish it was bigger, and I was kind of excited for the basket that I didn't get."
1,"This merchant, Earth Parents, does not care about customers!!","While I've used this product for years, I had a terrible experience with the merchant I bought this from: Earth Parents. I needed to cancel my order (placed over a weekend) and although I placed a cancellation just hours after my original order, Earth Parents completely ignored my cancellation request. Notably though, they had no problem taking my original order and my money!! When I contacted customer service, their only excuse was I sent the cancellation over the weekend and they don't read their communications over the weekend. What?!! -- They had no problem taking my order, which was *also* placed that weekend, within just hours of my cancellation. Talk about a stupid excuse, not to mention thoughtless customer service. The experience left a sour taste in my mouth - I won't be dealing with merchants from Amazon for a while yet, and certainly NEVER dealing with ""Earth Parents"" again."
5,Ranch on the Ruidoso,"Out standing book and a true event of the authors life from child hood into adult hood. He was very young when his father hired Billy the Kid when he was a youth and came by their ranch. His adventure in the Ruidoso area was inspired by those that knew Mr. Coe and wanted him to write dowm his stories he had told of his growing up in the valley. His wife, Louise, was the first State woman State Sentor from New Mexico, and they were very good friends of my parents. Great book."
2,Fencing the Sky,I love westerns but this book went back and forth from present then back when he was in college. When he was on drugs then again back to the present. It was confusing for me to keep track on where the author wanted to go. I wouldn't recommend this book.
3,But what a preposterous ending!,"I love Wyoming, and Galvin brought me to tears more than once with his loving and poetic descriptions of the land, the people who want to protect it, and his indictment of horrible Takers and Users who see only dollar signs in that beauty.Galvin's message about the land and the Wyoming rancher's fading way of life should be read and treasured. But stop reading this book when you reach Page 235. I wish I had.PS: or read Galvin's beautiful ""The Meadow,"" also about the Medicine Bow area. Its characters are the people who lived there (composites of them are in ""Fencing""), and while the ending is sad, it's believable."
5,ink,"The product is new, would never go back to used and refilled because of such poor results. Delivery is very fast and the product is as described."
4,"If you have to go, you have to go...","As someone who once did 'the trip' myself, although as a young and irresponsible backpacker over 10 years ago, I really enjoyed Fredrik & Heather's diaries. Brought back the travel bug...Actually the most intriguing part of their story is the part I did not do, e.g. leaving an established life with apartment, jobs, family expectations, etc... The realization that the risk of leaving everyting for 'the trip' and regretting it later, is nothing compared with not going and then regret not having gone. This is when you know, you have to go. You can get a lot more philosophical about this issue than F&H; ever did in their book, but it makes for good reading, so I could have had more of it.Apart from that, the only thing missing from this inspiring story were a few decent maps!"
5,EASY,"EASY, FAST, THIS WAS A PRODUCT THAT I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING. GREAT SERVICE AND I WOULD DO BUSINESS AGAIN!"
3,Seem much like regular crayons to me,"Perhaps I'm using them incorrectly, but these oil pastels look and feel like regular crayons to me, except that the colors are applied more easily (with less pressure), and are richer than in regular crayons. I like the silver and gold metalic colors. These are nice quality, but too thick for me, and there aren't enough different colors. The results appear like regular crayons to me, although richer in color. I'd expected the results to resemble paints."
5,crayola 28 ct colored oil pastel sticks,I had been looking all over for these before Christmas for my Granddaughter & could not find them. Gave these to her for Christmass & she loves them
5,Surprisingly fun to use,"For a simple child's product, I found these surprisingly good to use in my mixed media paintings. They seem to blend well, and were a lot of fun."
4,Beginner Art,"These are def. for younger kiddos, if you want more professional pastels buy Faber CastellGel Sticks - 12 ct.orSakura XEP50 50-Piece Cray-Pas Junior Artist Assorted Color Oil Pastel Set. These are 28 hexagonal sticks with a good variety of colors: white, black, red-orange, yellow-orange, blue-green, yellow-green, red-violet, blue-violet, green, violet, orange, yellow, blue, red, brown, peach, apricot, forest green, midnight blue, goldenrod, brick red, sea grean, sky blue, green-yellow, pink, gold, silver, and last but not least, gray. Enjoy."
3,"Great DVD, terrible trailers","The good news is the band was great. Our whole family loves Fountains of Wayne. An excerpt of this concert aired 2 or 3 years ago on PBS's Sound Stage. This is the full concert and is fun to watch.The bad: the movie trailer that was part of the previews was awful. It featured nudity that was inappropriate for my 9 year old who loves Fountains of Wayne. I'm guessing this was the production company's decision and not the band's but it detracts from what is otherwise a great show. The trailer plays automatically, but can be bypassed by selecting menu."
5,it's a must,"this foundation is the best i've ever ever used!!! it leaves my skin so perfect, it seems airbrushed, flawless, i love it so much!!! it's a amazing products, and also i have oily skin and with this foundation i had no problems. usually if i use certain types of foundations my skin being oily naturally becomes so shiny and more oily, but with this foundation covers everything, my skin seems perfect!"
5,"airflash-works great, lasts well","This type spray foundation was new to me. I've usually used creme foundations, but a friend introduced me to Airflash. It's far superior to those I've used before and well worth the price. Mine has lasted for more than 3 months thus far and hasn't run out yet. I think this is because I was taught to spray 1-3 short blasts onto the flat side of a makep brush, then ""paint"" it onto my skin (it is a lightweight, dewy natural look as everyone describes)-- then repeat this process as needed until my makeup has been fully applied. None is wasted into the air, my hair or onto any clothing as some of the other reviews I have read here note. I'd encourage others to try it with a brush! At 30 days a month, mine is going on more than 90 applications and not gone yet."
3,Not for ALL skin types,"This makeup clogs your pore, and highlights existing clogged pores. So if you're planning to use it, make sure you use purifying strips (from Biore or Boscia) beforehand. Also, there are not many shades in this makeup, making it tough to match your skin tone. Also, it takes a few tries to put it on right, and you need to use a makeup setting spray to make it more matte.So, I believe this makeup does not suit dry or combination skin types, as it seems to be drying, and looks so powdery!"
1,This make up accentuates lines you never knew you had,"I had my make-up done by a make-up artist at Dior, excellent make-up artist by the way, however this makeup is not for anyone who tends to have dry skin. Even if you use serum, moisturizer, and primer before you apply, and you are exfoliating three-times a week as I do, this foundation will accentuate lines on your face you never knew you had, or see without makeup.I'm sorry Dior, however I'm going back to Teint Idole by Lancome, which provides a dewy fresh look to my skin."
4,Flawless skin,"I love this spray foundation, It leaves your skin smooth and flawless, I spray my brush with foundation and with just a few swoops across my face and Im done."
5,SoulFul&ROmantic,This is Quality Romantic R-N-B Music that is Timeless.BloodStone with Natural High Alone Blows the Mind.James Brown with Try Me.He has Written Some of The Greatest Slow Jams Ever.these Songs can all stand on their own.a Must have.
1,Stay away from this DVD...,"...or you'll regret you spent the money. Instead, buy Carpenter's excellent biography. Or buy Artist and Illustrator. I'm a huge Tolkien fan and this movie was embarassing to watch. I agree with the recent review that the interview with Carpenter was the best (so read his book). It was also nice to see some of the Oxford environs (especially for those of us who aren't English), but the tour guides were total hacks."
1,Painful at best,"I kept looking at the clock to see if it was over yet and forced myself to watch the whole thing. To review all the bad parts would involve me having to watch it again and honestly, I can't think of a good thing to say about it. This is one purhcase I deeply regret."
2,Too much distortion,"Bought this unit to replace a similar one I bought back in 2005 which finally broke. Everything works fine except I get a lot of distortion in the music. It's like the bass is turned up all the way. When I turn the bass down to compensate the music still sounds distorted but without any bass. I tried it on my car radio and on two portable boxes in my house and got the same result. I even tried different MP3 players and setting it to different frequencies, same results. Not sure why but it ruins an otherwise good product."
4,"Works Well, good price","I bought this to stream itunes onto my home stereo system. I must say it works very well with no distortion or static. The key is to find a relatively clear channel to minimize interference. This is no problem, because this device allows you to select from 30 different fm channels, and there is certain to be one that fits the bill. This thing won't win any beauty prizes, but it works well for my purposes, and it's not i-whatever specific, so you can plug it into anything with a headphone jack. Invest in some rechargable aaa batteries if you plan on hosting a rave as the batteries last about 4-5 hours."
4,Misinformation on Amazon...,"This little device appeared to function correctly, and I was generally happy with my purchase, but for one little thing...The Amazon page for the product indicated that this product was powered by AA sized batteries, when in actuality it is powered by AAA batteries. Following my purchase here, I went to another site (which was having a sale) and purchased a set of AA batteries and a charger for said batteries. I've returned my Amazon purchase, and will debate the return of the other item, once I receive it...As of this posting, the Amazon site is not yet updated to remove the reference to AA batteries.Be advised - THIS ITEM USES AAA (triple A) BATTERIES, NOT AA BATTERIES!"
4,Great product - only flaw: does not turn off,"I bought this product because my vehicle does not have a tape deck or an auxiliary port, only a CD player. A friend of mine picked this item up at the beach and hasn't had any problems with it and said it was pretty inexpensive.This product works great! There is the occassional radio interference around the local college but it fades pretty quickly.The only big problem I have with this product is that the ON/OFF button does NOT work. The transmitter never turns off, the blue light remains on. Each time I get out of my car I have to pull one of the batteries out of the back. It gets annoying only when I lose the battery in between the seats...."
2,Static Transmitter,"I got this transmitter because of decent rating this transmitter has receive. The built quality felt really cheap to me and I believe there are only 6 preset frequency that you can use. Here's the major problem and hopefully mine was defective. There was so much static it's impossible to enjoy the music. The only way to hinder the static was to hold it in your hands. In my opinion buying this FM transmitter is a gamble. I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone."
1,Piece of Junk!,"This FM transmitter is probably the worst I've ever bought. The signal is fuzzy and the volume is low! I plugged my FUZE mp3 player in and started up a few quality rap tunes only to find out I had to turn the knob up to hear them! Then I heard static every time I moved the unit (yes, just from moving it). This FM transmitter barely works and is not really worth the money unless you happen to find one at a dollar store one day. I mean at least you can hear music if you turn up the volume, so it's worth that much.If you want a reliable FM transmitter, I recommend a MobileBlackBox."
1,Terrible,"After reading the positive reviews, I was happy to purchase this item. Went through the provided set of batteries with no issues, upon the first battery change, unit began to transmit only the instrumentals, not the singers voice. Tried different sets of batteries, different adjustments on the unit, as well as different vehicles but nothing worked. very dissapointed"
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought it after reading very good reviews from users, but wish I could get my money back! I have tried all the FM radio frequencies and could not find one that is good enough to listen to my MP3 players. The background noise was deafening.Do not waste your money on it!!!"
3,Be Observant,"This is a good pencil. I used it for a few years and enjoyed it. Then the PhD ultra came out. It's a better pencil. While I was searching for phd ultras on Amazon this was included in the search. So be careful when considering this product. It's still a very durable pencil that writes well. It's large enough for my big, man hands as well. It's just not as ergonomic or as sleek as the ultra. O well. Still a good product, but wouldn't have bought it if I had known."
2,Canada's Illest MC. I don't think so.,"I've been reading about the buzz on Choclair and actually heard some of his earlier material like ""21 Years"" years ago which is mad nice. However, his debut Ice Cold is not at all reminiscent of his material when he was unsigned. On the majority of the tracks all he's doing is trying to pick-up and ""hit"" hotties---all that juvenile stuff that most rappers talk about. The beats on ""Rubbin'"", the title track and Bare Witness (featuring Guru) are pretty hot, but no self-respecting hip hop head can say that this guy is saying anything relevant lyrically about where he comes from (Toronto) or anything for that matter. The interlude (i.e. ""Intro"", ""Kardi's PSA"") are just plain stoopid 'cause all he's doing is boasting about his sexual prowess and disrespecting women in the process. This album's a major disappointment."
5,Phat joint,I think that cd iz excellent ! It really represent an emcee that have a lot of potential. Especially the track with GURU of Ganstarr is really a good song. That emcee just keep it real and the way he tells things really blow me up. It 's really a phat joint buy it today
3,Luke Warm,"Choclair's album (like Harold says) is mediocre. He's better unsigned than he is now...there is no real lyrics. I am glad though to see some MC's from Canada along with Saukrates. Choclair just seems to mix West Coast Hot Boyz with Gangstarr. If you like that, then fine. But if you've heard Choclair prior to the record deal, you'd think he could have come out sounding fresher. Keep it coming Canada, you might blow up like Vince Carter...?"
3,Frozen in Time,Choclair just couldn't get the job done on this one. Too many songs sound alike and the features are alright but mediocre at best.
5,Everyone slept on this man,"This album is a weapon. I'm sure if he would've had the right buzz, alot of these rappers would've been in trouble. I'd bet any amount of money that this Canadian artist can take the majority of todays hottest NY rappers to the hole in a freestyle battle. Its a shame how this man got no buzz over here in the east. This album will be considered a classic to me."
4,Great Canadian Artist!,"Choclair has got some hot tracks on here such as ""Lets Ride"" ""Rubbin"" ""Jambone"". The beats are off the hook and you can just pop it in and let it play till the end (with the exception of skipping the skits and a couple tracks). His style is one of a kind, if I was to compare it to other artists I would say Nas but less lyrical genius.INTRO - Didnt really need an intro, ""ICE COLD"" would have been a great 1st track to the album.ICE COLD - 4 of 5LETS RIDE - 5 of 5RUBBIN - 5 of 5TAKIN IT IN - 4 of 5BARE WITNESS - 4 of 5JAMBONE - 5 of 5FRESH - 3 1/2 of 5KARDI'S P.S.A. - Just another skit talking about how choclair loves the ladiesROLLIN - 4 of 5YOUNG GUNZ - 3 1/2 of 5 (I didnt like memphis bleek's verse)RUNNIN WID US - 4 1/2 of 5FLAGRANT - 3 1/2 of 5DIE HARD - 4 of 5S.O.T - 3 of 5DA CHIZNOCK - 4 of 5SITUATION 9 - 4 of 5ROLLIN(RADIO) - 4 of 5I recommend this album to anyone who loves Hip Hop, a decent album to complement your collection."
4,puts a nice one down for canada,the only reason why i got this album was because a friend of mine got it and i bought it of him for a dollar i wasn't suprised at how solid this album was but still i think the k-os is the best canadian emc guru of gangstarr works with him along with the saukrates and kardinal this is a solid canadian hip hop album and may have opened up american minds and worldwide minds with this album but maestro freed him into the game by getting an american deal pick this one up or not the choice is yours like black sheep8 of 10 lyrics 8 of 10 beats
4,"Sustainable, Socially Equitable, AND Delicious!","I find this particular tea to be not as strong as I would like. I can stretch 16oz+ out of a tea bag with some of the other varieties. Regardless, this tea is delicious and great quality.I love this brand:*Fair Trade Certified*Organic (USDA Certified)*Their facility is powered with renewable energy (via RECs)*Individual teas wrapped in unbleached, biodegradable packaging*The only thing not biodegradable is the outer plastic wrapping, which can be recycled with other stretch plastics (such as grocery bags)."
5,Classically Beautiful Fragrance - timeless and delightful,"I searched for 14 years to find Jicky after reading about it in a teen magazine in 1964. The article was written by Patti Boyd who was then George Harrison's girlfriend and she mentioned JICKY was her favorite fragrance. I kept the name in mind, having no idea it was made by Guerlain, and finally in November 1978, I found it in Macy's in NYC. It was love at first sniff. Jicky is my favorite scent-- light with lavender....smells good summer and winter. It's a true classic and I hope to God they never stop making it. I want to be buried wearing Jicky"
3,Not the most coherent trade paperback out there...,"I am not a regular reader of Superman comics, nor have I been a regular reader of comics in general the last few years, so I was very curious in learning the story behind Lex Luthor becoming president as soon as I heard about it. This book is supposed to provide that story, but instead it offers something less than that; I slightly incoherent, inconsistent, and hard to follow story made up of bits and pieces of various issues of the Superman titles. When so many different artists and writers are involved, the differences in tone and style quickly become distracting and annoying, particularly when the artist and writer would often change after just 2 or 3 pages. Viewpoints and characters also would change abruptly. There is no consistent flow at all. Overall this book is average, but the strong points include a short section featuring a meeting between Batman and Luthor."
2,Great Story - Horrible Art,"I am a long time Superman fan that gave up buying comic books in the mid 90s. I have been looking to get back into comic books and this book was recommended as having a good storyline. And the storyline is great. The characters had real depth, and this certainly something different than the usual ""let's have two really powerful guys beat on each other"" story. However the ""art"" is so horrible at times it is almost painful to look at. I can't believe someone got paid to produce the pages I saw. Good art can never replace a good story, but bad art can certainly ruin a good story. It did in ""President Lex""."
1,Nice pencil but read the fine print before buying.,"I love these pencils. They are easy to use for long periods of time with the nice grip and large eraser. I thought it was a great price for a box of twelve of them so ordered two. When it came in the mail, I was irritated to find two pencils with a rubber band around them. The description says, ""12 Green Barrel Pencil"" and the picture shows a box of twelve but the fine print says, ""sold as 1 each."" Lesson learned: definitely read the fine print."
3,dissatisfied with title,I was not happy at all when i got this package it only had 1 PENCIL!!!! It said 12 pencils would come but only one did. I called amazon and they told me to call the manufacturer and i did. They were very nice and they refunded me. It was the exact pencil like the image i just wish i would've got how many they said i was going to receive it otherwise it is a great pencil
1,"About the ""Americas very best guitar teacher!""","If you want to know more about Pastor Ralph Paul AcernoCheck out his account of his UFO encounters.[...]His Bio says he plays piano, it doesn't mention his guitar playing (Curious).BTW,If this was the best way to teach guitar, everyone would teach this way. (Why teach second best)So.... Buyer beware."
1,Very bad instructor,This is one of the biggest scams that i have been taken on he does not give you any time to view one thing before he is ready to move on to something new.wish I would have requested a refund right away. Do not waste your money.
1,Hack,"To even consider purchasing this you must be either hopeless or pathetic. Anyone who's played the guitar even slightly seriously can see within one of his ""demonstrations"" that he's a complete hack. If you're this desperate to learn a few cheesy basic ""riffs"" on guitar then I would suggest going to YouTube for free. I as well learned of this through a late night infomercial and found it funny at first then became sickened. I've been playing guitar for a long time and would be upset if anyone I cared about gave money to this pinprick just to learn useless methods and bad techniques."
1,Even Esteban could kick his ass,"I used to think Esteban was the king of fake guitarists, until I saw this wankers TV commercial. He is obviously only a month or two into playing himself. A better suggestion was made earlier to look at the free Youtube videos..much better resource."
1,What a flippin loser,Who is this guy? To think he can teach music in 5 minutes is pathetic! Please don't waste your money.
2,"too thin, heat doesn't distribute well","The metal used to create this wok is too thin. When I use the wok on my gas stove, the bottom heats up really well, but that's about it. As a result, unless you're constantly stirring the contents, the bottom part will burn.It's a decent cheap wok, but I suggest purchasing a more solid product."
5,Best book for childbirth,"I read a ton of books on childbirth preparation, and this was my all-time favorite. The approach is balanced, comforting, and empowering, not vitriolic against the medical community but enlightening and encouraging. It helped ease my fears of childbirth and gave me the confidence to take ownership of my birthing experience."
5,Beautiful book- so important for any expectant mother to read!,"I owe my entire natural childbirth and delivery to this book. I was calm, collected and centered. I never once had fear or uncertainty, because of the techniques I learned in this book. My labor was smooth, consistent and the baby was born less than 45 minutes after ARRIVING at the birthing center! I really enjoyed the techniques that it teaches you WHILE you're pregnant, to prepare for labor. The pain coping techniques, the breathing, the positions and stretches. I felt completely prepared for labor and delivery and it relieved any anxiety I had about pregnancy. I would buy this book for every pregnant mother I know!"
4,The best book for your second birth,"After a long and harrowing first birth, I was looking for something more than the vanilla What To Expect When You're Expecting and with more information than you get from your doctor on ways to prevent a C-section and avoid drugs.This is that book. There is a lot of ""get in touch with yourself"" art projects and such but there is also a lot of medical information and advice.This book, more than any other, prepared me for the birth of my second child. And, I am happy to say, that despite no mid-wife and a husband who thought I was crazy not to take an epidural, I delivered au naturale after seven hours of labor. The rice socks were a life saver!Know your options and understand them. Read this book."
4,a repeat of Creative Childbirth,I loved Creative Childbirth for my first and used it and Better Birthing with Hypnosis for my 2nd . I received ' Within 'for a gift . Liked it but other two had all I needed plus fantastic audio tapes. A good runner up but birth art in Creative and Better Birthing much more healing This is agood runner up to first two Linda
5,The best resource!,"As a nurse and first-time mom, I found myself in constant search of information during my pregnancy. However, all of the things I read which were ""clinical"" descriptions or ""prescriptive"" manuals for how to go through labor left me feeling anxious and empty. Then I found this book and, admittedly, I thought it looked kind of hokey when I first picked it up. But I soon discovered that it was the most empowering thing I had read so far. I think that people who already have a basic understanding of the mechanics of labor need look no further than this book for support and direction. It truly allows you to be yourself, direct your own birth experience, and believe in your own natural abilities, without criticizing those who find they need pain control or medical intervention. I highly recommend this book to every parent who wants to experience birth, not just survive it."
4,"Good For Pregnancy/Birth, Look Elsewhere for Babycare","This book is an excellent resource for preparing a mother to birth her baby normally. It presents childbirth realistically (it's hard work; it hurts, and you can do it) and provides coping strategies that are very effective. It strives to bring out the ""birth warrior"" in women and to help them get in touch with their primal, creative, instinctual selves. This is NOT a book that tells you to relax and breathe! Encourages being active, aware, and insightful, and it does not patronize, sermonize, or insult the intelligence of anyone.However, like some of the other reviewers, I take issue with some of her babycare advice, especially regarding breastfeeding. For babycare advice, look elsewhere. I suggest anything by the Sears' or La Leche League."
2,Not what I was looking for,"So, for those of you interested in creating art projects and then attempting to find meaning in them, buy this book. I'm sure there is nothing really wrong with the book, but it doesn't appeal to me at all. I am not interested in such things personally. I would love birth stories, scientific information, etc. I love Ina May Gaskin's books on birthing. This just isn't what I thought it would be. Maybe I should have trusted some of the other reviewers!"
3,Do you like to draw?,Very different book. Takes you through your inner emotions and how to better cope with the labor and delivery process. Had some good points. A complement for your other books.
2,Has good points but...,"This book has a lot of good ideas and good points, but a caution to first-time moms: despite being a birth attendant herself, the author ended up with a c-section with her first child, and I felt that the whole book had the feel of 'here is a wonderful, beautiful journey...and it has a high probability of ending in surgery.' I know you can't discount all the information because of this, but I also think you have to go into natural childbirth 100% sure that is what you want, that it is safe and healthy and the best option. The author also admits that she almost didn't include the chapter on home birth...which is such an important yet overlooked option. If you already have had vaginal birth(s) then I would definitely recommend this book! It's just hard for first-timers when the book plays into that fear of whether your body can actually successfully birth a baby or not."
3,Birthing from within,This book was a great book to read. I did feel it could have been better organized as far as the chapters go but over all it was good.
1,Surprisingly not very useful,"Wow, given all the positive reviews for this book I put it on my must read list. I read the first few chapters then started flipping to see if there was better material coming, there wasn't. The emphasis on this book is on the spiritual and emotional. They lost me at the ""birth art"" section. Sorry, I'm not pulling out my Crayolas to draw a picture and better understand my fears about birth. I'm also not overly interested in a bunch of individual birth stories or feeling connected with every mother in the world. There must be plenty of people out there this book appeals to given the high rating, but if you're looking for a fact based, practical book this isn't it."
5,Revolutionary and Inspiring!!!!,"This book is the best preparation for birth that I have found. I've been a birth professional for five years and if I could recommend only one book to families, this would be the one. It takes a unique approach to childbirth preparation and speaks to the heart of what parents really need to know to be in birth. I can't say enough good things about this book."
4,Good ideas,"My doula recommended this book to prepare me for childbirth. I have been reading it steadily since. I think that it has a lot of wisdom and ideas for preparing mentally for childbirth. It focuses a lot on birth art and also has some great ways to practice how to deal with pain. Definitely an alternative perspective to childbirth (that is from the medical model), but I think it is empowering for a woman to read. And has some nice chapters to prepare the father for childbirth too. I would recommend it for a woman trying to prepare for labor and childbirth."
3,Not a bad read,"This book was ok for me, not spectacular not horrible. I could do without the artsy stuff in the beginning. I would say that I don't think this helped me prepare for birth in any way but I still liked reading it for the most part, at least after about chapter 16 or so. I noticed one comment saying that this book was more for the all natural non medicated approach but I would say that didn't seem overly implied to me. Borrow it from a friend first, if you really like it and it's techniques buy it for yourself. I am going to be donating mine to the borrowing library at my midwifery's birthing center."
5,Awesome Book,This book was recommended to me by my (HMO)Midwife because I was asking questions and panicing just a little bit. It shows a variety of options that are available to you as an expectant mother. It offers suggestions and guidance to help you answer those questions that no one else can answer but you. It also helps you to have confindence in your choices. It is an all around great resource that helps to build you up as a soon to be parent!
4,Very useful information,"Due to scheduling, I was unable to attend a Birthing From Within class in my area and took a hospital based baby care class. It was super interesting to read the book because the information at times contradicted what I was learning in the hospital class and that really gave me another objective to think about. There are a lot of exercises in the book which I will try at home and think it'd probably be better in a class setting but overall this was a very good read and I recommend it."
5,"Finally, a book that made me feel better about giving birth.","After reading What to Expect When You're Expecting, Conception, Pregnancy & Birth, and A Thinking Woman's Guide cover to cover, I was petrified of the whole birthing process because of the sterile and clinical depiction given in each. From an educational standpoint, these books each have merits of their own, however emotionally they left me feeling very detached. I am at 34 weeks and have not given birth yet, but I have much less anxiety and feel much more spiritually and mentally prepared after reading Birthing From Within."
4,Just what I needed...,"With my first pregnancy I bought the ""What to Expect"" book, but by my second pregnancy I knew what I could expect. Having a baby is more than braxton hicks, bleeding gums, swollen ankles, etc. I needed something different, something to prepare and bolster me emotionally for laboring again. I was relieved to find something different from the usual."
5,Pam England is a gem! Great practical guide.,"Good practical advice and excercises that can help prep you for the birthing process, whether you're going natural or assisted."
4,good advice in general,"this book contains hands on on exercises of drawing and self-reflecting about birth. Some of them I found them repetitive. However as any other book that relates to natural birthing, this one has good advice."
2,Waste of Money,"I wish I had saved my money on this book. I read ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way"" and ""Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn"" before reading this book, and it doesn't even come close to being as informative as the other two. It doesn't give much detail on the actual process of birth. It's mostly just imagery and art projects. The only useful part to me was about identifying what your real fears or hangups about birth are. The rest of it was way too touchy feely for me, and the advice amounted to ""follow your instincts""."
2,Weird Birthing Book,"Very ""new age"" hippy-like birthing book. Had some useful information, but had to filter through the preachy, biased, and over-the-top spiritual and artistic junk to get anything out of it. Skimmed 150 pages, read about 15 pages, and am ready to ""retire"" this book."
2,Gave me an unneeded guilt trip in the labor room. Boo!,"I was very excited about this book and read it in earnest during my third trimester. The ""art"" sections were superfluous; I sought tangible advice for ""labor day"". Once in labor, my midwife respected my wishes not to be ""offered"" an epidural, but the attitude of this book caused me to delay my request for an epidural by 3-4 hours. My only regret in labor was that I let this book make me feel guilty about getting an epidural. After the epidural, my remaining labor/delivery was very pleasant."
1,I do not recommend this book,"I did not read more than a few pages. This book was ""out there."" The ideas of how birth is in and how medical staff are in the hospital; I find hard to believe. I am not having a baby at home. Drugs are not ""terrible"" for pain control. I wanted tips on handling the beginning pains before the epidural and how to have a healthy birth. This book was a waste of money and time. I didn't even waste my time finishing it."
1,Howling like a coyote???????? No thank you!,"First off, this was honestly one of the scariest reads ever. It put me in the mind of a ""hippy-esque cult"" type of deal. A majority of the book focuses on being creative through mediums such as drawing, painting, and sculpting. I'm completely for spirituality, creativity and natural childbirth, but being a first time mom, I have a feeling that all the spiritual and creative mumbo jumbo thrown at me in this book is just setting me up for the ultimate rude awakening when I actually go into labor. And if howling like a coyote will benefit me in any way, I seriously doubt it. I, being a free-thinker and very openminded, could find very little useful in this book. Even though I've been thrust into the category of a ""hippie"" my whole life, this puts me more in mind of a cult!"
3,Birthing from Within,Very similar to another method and book published earlier. needs to expand on ideas. i needed something more concrete to allay my fears. This didn't do it.
2,Big waste of money!,"I regret wasting my money and time on this book. I have read everything that I could get my hands on during pregnancy and this book was absolutely useless. For a natural birth, I highly recommend Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way."
2,Not recommended,"I found this book pretty useless. A lot of it deals with ""birth art,"" which seems like it would be useful for someone who had a previous traumatic birth experience, but that's not me, so I found the excessive birth-art stories & examples irrelevant. A few of the pain-management techniques are good, but nothing you won't see elsewhere (or can't figure out for yourself). I'm not exactly sure why this book is so popular, and after reading it, I'm very glad I didn't sign up for a course based on it!"
5,Great book on the inner aspects of birthing,Most books on birth focus on what is going to happen TO your body during labor and delivery. This is one of the new that switches the focus to what will happen IN your head and heart. I found it very insightful and extremely helpful. I loved the sections with suggestions on journal topics and creating art to express issues surrounding birth.
2,Way too thin.,"The package arrived very quickly. However, the sweatshirt is so thin that it may as well be a long sleeved t-shirt."
1,Unquiet Soul: A Biography of Charlotte Bronte,"The book was delivered well-packed and promptly but I was very disappointed to see that in Chapters 14 - 26 most lines had been heavily underscored with comments written in the margins. Presumably the previous owner was responsible for this vandalism. Perhaps the seller had not noticed this as the book was marked ""in good condition""."
1,Can't view it properly.,"I tried playing this on my six year old personal DVD player. Nothing. I have a laptop with Vista and it won't play on my Windows Media Center at all either. I do have Quickplay, but the images which are clear, but jumpy sort of like a slide show. The audio is jumpy and barely intelligible and not worthy of watching. I would return it to Amazon, but I bought it over a month ago and I don't have a receipt. If anyone can tell me how to play this darn DVD-R video disk, PLEASE inform me!!"
