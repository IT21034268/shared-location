3,Worth the price for the information contained inside.,"The author is no word beater when it comes to writing skills, but she obviously knew President Lyndon Johnson very well. No one reading this book could not take her seriously. Madeleine Duncan Brown was part of history. She was indeed a secret lover of LBJ. In fact, she bore and raised his only son. The most interesting passage in the book takes place on Thursday night in Dallas, Texas, November 21, 1963, at the home of Clint Murchison. Read the book for the details of that night as Johnson whispers in the author's ear, ""After tomorrow those goddamn Kennedys will never emparrass me again--that's no threat--that's a promise."" A must read for JFK assassination researchers."
3,Standard horror with a rumored real-life tragic footnote,"There's nothing really new here except for a rather eye-opening sequence where the nerd-who-will-become-the-slasher is soundly humiliated in front of ""the gang""--complete with extended and rather graphic male nudity. Supposedly, the actor who played the nerd, Simon Scuddamore, committed suicide shortly after its release, which makes watching this scene a faintly queasy experience."
5,THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE,"I don't know why so many people dislike this movie,I think it's the best horror movie ever made.It's entertaining,scary,for the most part it's an all around terrific movie.....Caroline Munro did a great job as Carol.As she really is english,alot of the actors are americans trying to fake english accents,and doing a terrible job of it.The movie is shot in London,and had three directors.Alot of people put this movie down and they should'nt.It's not a bad movie at all.The acting could have been a little better but the movie was great all the same.I've seen it many times and every time it's fun to watch.The ending was weird, ....Caroline Munro is 52 now.She was 36 when she made Slaughter High.I give this movie a ten."
4,Late 1980s b-horror cult fave...,"Was originally supposed to be titled April Fool's Day (watch the flick and you'll understand why), but since another film with the same title came out first, this movie had to go with the more direct 'Slaughter High' (catchy title, eh?). Sort of typical in that virtually none of the actors look young enough to BE in high school, and it has a plotline and concept heavily borrowed from National Lampoon's Class Reunion. A little bit of nudity and some gore here and there, although overall it's more ridiculous and laugh-inducing than scary."
3,"Unfortunate ""R"" Rating","Alright ""Gorehounds"", avoid the ""R"" rated version. It is obvious that the MPAA got a hold of this one. It's hard to find but there is an unrated version! This version shows all the good stuff-gore-nudity-sex! The movie itself I felt was decent. It has some suprising moments and interesting death scenes. If you are a ""Friday the 13th"" fan you will also recognize the music, yes the infamous Harry Manfrandini handles the music for ""Slaughter High"". This movie is definatly worth watching once, so grab your girl and a cold beer and enjoy it!"
5,This Movie Rocks!,"This is definitely one of the corniest, most cheesy, horrible films i've ever seen. I LOVE IT!!!!!!! Male frontal nudity, psycho nerd, hot sexual trysts, and blood and gore make this just the kind of movie that you'd want to take home to mommy and daddy. ""WUSS!"" - some zombie ghost jock dude"
4,EPITOME OF 80'S SLASHER FILMS,"This slasher movie is the epitome of 80's slasher films. Before people bullied on Facebook, they did it in person. Marty was the victim of such bulling done by a certain click. During one of the pranks, Marty is disfigured by both fire and acid. After 5 years a class reunion, consisting only of the click is held at the abandoned school house. After the first person is killed, the crowd decides to stay together, but then separates to get slashed one at a time. While the slasher wears a joker's mask, it really isn't meant to be a who-dun-it. Nudity, including male nudity (poor Marty), but no nude shots of the star Caroline Munro, former Bond girl."
1,shmutz!,"Good greif! and grief is what you will feel as you watch this barrel of rot! seeing as how i am the first to review this, i take it not many others have had to endure my pain. nonetheless, in the off chance some unlucky soul sees this, be warned.The cover made the film seem good. I mean, can a movie with the tagline ""Marty Majored in Cutting Classmates"" be so Bad? So we have marty, a nerd who gets burned by cruel bullies and sets out to get his revenge. ""Terror Train"" handled this topic much better and i recommend you go and watch that.There is little gore, poorly set up kills and no suspense..at all. The movie looks like a troma film, stripped naked of any entertainment value. Now for a spolier(not that it matters..you probably won't get this far unless you are a glutton for punishment)......! how original! Toto, i don't think we're in Kansas anymore!!"
1,slaughter high,Not even worth switching on the VCR for. Predictable plot and poor acting. I award one star as I feel the director did try make some attempt to make a Horror Movie.
1,Terrible!,"You would think the creators of FRIDAY THE 13TH would have talent to show, but no, instead we get SLAUGHTER HIGH one of the worst horror films ever made!Theres nothing original, the acting is really trash and overall it's unenjoyable.Give it a miss, you won't be sorry!1 star for gore."
4,ANOTHER GREAT 80'S SLASHER MOVIE,"Slaughter High is a film that you can come back to again and again. The casio keyboards playing throughout the whole movie. The janitor that works in a school that has been closed down for years. The actors who are playing people half their age. The victim who hits the killer with a bat and then throws it down and runs. And of course you have everyone agreeing to stay together to be safe and they end up seperating. It's all here. For fans of Don't Go In The Woods,The Final Terror and April Fool's day, this is one movie you will really like."
2,LionsGate should give this movie away!,"Talk about a bad 80s revenge horror flick. This one wins the prize for sure. If it weren't for the cool killings, I'd have stopped the player fifteen minutes into the movie. Overall, it's an uncut experience of bad acting, bad directing, and bad plotting.You know it's bad when a nerd who seeks revenge almost a decade later, who hasn't gained any appreciable muscle mass or strength, manages to lift a 170 pound guy with one arm like Jason Vorhees or Myers. I can only suspend my disbelief for so long before I throw my hands up in the air.Anyway, I'm a horror buff but this one shouldn't be in my collection and you better think long and hard before it becomes a part of yours. Just rent it instead."
2,pretty dumb,This movie is completly a wast of time.I spent 4 bucks on this crap from a local video store.At least the special efects are half way decent.The ending is dumb and the acting flat out stinks. Don't wast your money on this movie.
1,SLAUGHTERED DVD!!!,"I was so excited that the dvd was coming out, so I rented it and I was very unsatisfied of the poorly job they gave this classic movie...VHS-to-DVD, no widescreen, just like other great films like Fright Night part 2. Shame on Lionsgate, they might as well not even released it at all!!! I'll just keep my dvd-r, tell you the truth I think my dvd-r has better sound and picture to tell you the truth. If you already have this on dvd-r, do not buy the new one.Just a waste of your money."
5,Truly heavenly,"What can I say for this fragrance? There's a reason it is only sold at Fine department stores. Simply b/c it's divine. The wonderful blend of vanilla, patchouli, and other spices is light and sweet but wears well. If heavy parfums leave you choking then try angel and experience it's true efferevescent aroma. And the bottle is refillable too for a discounted rate off the original purchase price? You can't beat that with a stick."
1,Yuck,"This just smells gross, more like Patchouli oil than vanilla. In fact, I couldn't smell vanilla at all. I would've sent it back but for the restocking fee. Instead, I gave it to a friend (who will wear ANYTHING) with clear instructions never to wear it around me. Yuck."
2,"Seller is prompt, however product is not what I expected","I have actually returned this perfume because it did not smell like other bottles of Angel I have purchased. It was sent to me in a timely fashion, and appears to be the product I purchased, but it does not smell the same at all. The bottle looks the same, but it definitely isn't what I expected."
1,Bug spray?,"Had a chance to try Angel 5 times. I just cannot understand... From the notes, this should be my signature perfume. But on the test strip and my skin, it smells like a nauseating ""Off"" insect repellant. I try and I try but I can't smell ANY of the notes listed, except after 2-3 hours of torturous stink, I end up with a heavy, musky vanilla/patchouli mess.God I wish this worked for me. I'm shocked but pleased to see it's working for so many people however.All I can recommend is that you don't buy this blind, based on the listed notes. I almost did. SO happy I didn't.I think the name of this perfume is quite misleading. Such an earthy smell (patchouli) cannot belong to the heavens, can it?"
2,I DON'T LIKE IT,This perfume is not the original. I waste my money purchased it. Next time I prefer to buy at Macys
4,Really great Book,This book was the best one I have ever read. I am a cutter and it has helped me to cope with what I do. This book should be read by people who cut and people who know others who cut.
5,Fitted RV Sheets,"These sheets for our camper bed are a good buy for the price. They seem to be of good quality, are comfortable to sleep on, and the way the top and bottom sheets are attached make it pretty easy to make the bed. I would buy them again."
5,Hilarious and Witty,"I'm a huge golfer, but not a big golf book reader. When I picked this book up I thought it would be boring, like most of the golf books. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick I was enthralled with the book and the humor in it. Not only funny, but I could really relate to this book and feel like I'm standing right next to him while he is telling the story. It is a great read and I recommend to give to the golfer in your life. It is truly a joy to read."
1,Dissapointing,"I enjoy her concerts alot,especially La Luna. The dvd concerts are by far better than these ""VIDEOS"" So I recommend the concerts if you like Sarah Brightman, if you just like to see videos that are rather empty and fleeting and you are interested in directing than this uninspired dvd would be okay."
2,"interesting but little more, disappointing","I still love the music, but the video was mostly boring and often very little substance. Just stick with the CD, you'll be happier."
3,video and audio wanting,"The video quality of the interview portion was washed-out,too bright! I also see no compelling reason why the camera had to be moved sideways and at times in a rotating fashion during the interview portion!This gives the viewer motion sickness! The video collection portions were good! The audio sadly was only 2.0 when some of these videos were already released in 5.1! Saving memory space in the disc?"
5,"Sarah Brightman, DIVA , dvd",I am a new fan of Sarah Brightman. She is not only an Incredible Opera singer but also a Great Pop artist as well. This DVD contains videos and scenes from past dvd's. Tremendous scenery on and off stage. There is no other singer / performer like Sarah Brightman. A total Class -act. You won't be sorry. A must for all Sarah Brightman fans.
2,Surprise disappointment,"My wife is a huge fan- we have seen her live- when I first put it on, she couldn't stand it, and had me turn it off. The sound quality was below par. It seems to be a collection of old videos. Skip this one."
2,nothing much,"I have to say I didn't expect much , but this is less then that , though some where good starters & some where good end, there is a lot to noticed in between, as if they wonted the bring you some samples of the superman version in the seventies but not at his best , you can say almost as if it was a low design time capsule that was buried too long for it sake .But of course my review are mush influenced by me being an old seventies superman fan and already have seen half of the stories in the comic book , and with that in mind 2 stars is the best I can give."
5,An Intriguing Collection,"I have been a recent but ardent fan of Charles de Lint, so I snatched up this book as soon as I found it in the store. While not all of the stories revolved around Newford, the mythical city all de Lint fan's know and love, I enjoyed seeing a different side of of de Lint in this book. While de Lint is a master at ""Urban Fantasy"", he proves in this book that he can handle stories set in completely fantastical settings and still fill the characters with genuine emotions and personalities. I loved the Bordertown stories, especially the Horn Dance. I think however, that my favourite stories were 2 Newford stories, ""but for the Grace Go I"" and ""Somewhere in my mind there is a painting box"". These stories are, dare I say, prequels to other Newford stories, ""Waifs and Strays"" and the Novella ""Seven Wild Sisters"" found in ""Tapping the Dream Tree"". Though a different style than usual and definently aimed at a younger audience, this book is well worth it!"
2,Probably not what you're looking for,"I'm a supporter of Intelligent Design, and found this book to be a big disappointment. As a previous reviewer has said in more words, it does not really attempt to ""dissect the theory of evolution."" It is simply a collection of medical facts and trivia, after which the author asks in a sentence or two in each chapter, ""How can this be the work of chance?"" I read the first few chapters with highlighter pen in hand, expecting to highlight various things as I often do, but then found myself simply skimming through many sections as I began to realize that every chapter is the same: just a recitation of what things in our bodies do. If you're looking for argumentation and critical examination of evolutionary theory (such as in Behe's or Denton's books), this is not the book to buy."
2,A physician's-eye view of the human body,"The book basically gives a very simplistic overview of each body system (college-level anatomy and physiology textbooks are much deeper in scope) and ends with several main points from each chapter that would seem to point to design. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Christian and I believe in God. However, I have read better and more informative books about the design inherent in the universe as well as in humanity."
5,Great item,"Seemlessly integrated into my WindowsNT workstation. Copying files to and from the stick was easy and fast. Great for transporting data! I like this item, but I would recommend a larger capacity if you can afford to do so."
3,Shampoo,"More and more I'm having trrouble finding this therapeutic shampoo in the local stores, so it is nice to find a place online that allows me to purchase, and get delivery in just a few days."
4,A must-have for any Jayhawk basketball fan.,"The rich tradition and history of Kansas basketball is captured in this book. If you are a fan of Kansas basketball, the book is a ""must-have."" Many of the stories I had heard from my father and grandfather, both KU basketball fans, were rekindled in reading this book. And, many of my own memories, which had grown hazy as the years past, were revitalized by reading this history."
1,A wasted effort.,Only obsessive collectors of books on the occult should bother purchasing this title. More pages are spent on magic-users in popular culture than myth and 'history.' The author seems to have spent many hours of research watching Disney films and Saturday morning cartoons. And some movies that are described are woefully inaccurate which provides a sense of doubt that the author bothered to check any of his facts. A disappointing effort that should be avoided.
1,Bad choice - Read the book instead,"With incorrect pronunciations and clear lack of voice punctuations (possibly because the author is not a native speaker), this CD didn't make for a good listen. This might not count as Fredrick Davidson's most eloquent work. I felt the rhetoric was weak probably because of lack of emotions and empathy towards the sensitive and life altering episodes in the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Although ""Gandhi"" was pronounced correctly - I was disappointed."
5,"Absolutely hilarious, a must read",This book is really funny and amusing. It'll make you laugh and it will make you cry. It is touching and it's page turner!
2,Just o.k.,Outdated story that just isn't relevant today. if you are over 50 you might find it funny. wasn't worth the money.
1,I Haven't A Clue Why I Bought This,Must have been an 'idiot' moment when I bought this tripe. Please don't waste your own money. And I thought Jackie Collins was tawdry . . .
4,Inspirational,"Onward Christian Soldiers provides the listener with great inspirational hymns/songs in typical Salvation Army style - meaningful, devotionally and musical"
5,Fun for everyone,"My 5 year old and 2 year old love to sing into microphones so I got them this for Christmas and wow is it fun. I had to test it before I wrapped it and it was fun for me. They love it when I pretend to be Ursula with the voice effects and tell them to keep cleaning the living room. My five year old is really interested in reading just so that she can read the words to the songs. As a bonus, it turns out that the songs are really fun, I like learning the words. This is a hit in our house."
4,a neat toy,"I think this is a neat toy except for two things. I bought this for my 4 your old twins birthday and they love princesses. But, they cannot read so on the songs they do not know, which is quite a few, it is useless. Secondly, the cartridges they advertise are obviously not available. It is a lot of fun just goofing off with the different voices."
2,"Nice concept,but poor execution","What a wonderful concept and it almost worked. When all hooked up, the music words scrolled too fast! (Way too fast) Could not control this so tried to get help. Their web site disneyelectronics.com is totally worthless. If you find the product (out of hundreds listed), they send you to Amazon to buy it! Tried the phone number....would you believe this is a hot line for a cruise. It starts out,""Congradulations, you have just won a cruise to the Bahamas"". No link to the product!! You can not get help for this product!!! Disney is starting to loose it!!!"
5,HOT ITEM for kids from 1-92!,I cant say enough good things about this microphone my children range teenagers toddlers and adult. lol EACH one of them enjoy this microphone. We're a singing family. The person that enjoys it the most is of course my three year old. But my teenager is a close second to loving the microphone. GREAT Idea!!!
4,"Fun microphone, but where to get additional cartridges","My kids love this. Esp. the extra voices; mouse, dragon, bird, horse. Lots of fun. BUT, this item plainly states additional cartridges are available. I've looked EVERYWHERE. Finally called a couple of phone numbers from the instruction booklet and got the manufacturer and they gave me a number to call. I called and was told I can order by phone--what a hassle. I still havent ordered additional cartridges nor do I know what additional songs are available on these hard to get cartridges."
1,Disney Karaoke,"I got this for my 6 year old Granddaughter for Christmas as she loves to sing. Much to my dismay, my daughter returned it tome in February. They had sturggled with it for a month after Christmas trying to get it to work. Well, I tried to return it , but it was PAST the date to return items. Now I am stuck with a toy that doesn't work and my granddaughter didn't get a present. Thanks a lot!"
3,Rick Foster,You need to get Rick Foster's CD and hear it to appreciate the Close To Heaven Book. This book contains many Christian praise and worship music Rick superbly arranged for guitar.Check out Rick's website if you want to get his other publications.
1,An awful waste of money,"The concept is good but the design and actual use are terrible. For starters, the holes punch almost at the very edge of the paper, a far shallower punch than most any other on the market. You have to be careful that you push the edges of the sheets in as far as they can possibly go, or the holes end up at the edge of the sheets. Also, after a few uses, it's no longer possible to get sheets all the way in to be able to punch holes. The design not only makes it difficult to see if this is caused by jammed paper bits or something else, but impossible to fix that issue. A total disappointment. It's overpriced for other models that do the same thing, and it does a much worse job."
1,Fired for non-performance,"I agree with everything written in the other one-star review. The handle gets stuck when it's pressed down and is hard to dislodge. Holes don't get completely poked out. It barely works if you try to punch 12 sheets, which is what it claims to handle. I'm throwing it out and getting a different brand."
1,Broke after 2 years,"Mine broke after two years. It now only does the job half way, the cut doesn't go through the paper, so I'm forced to punch out all the holes manually.Also, the handle does get stuck in the punch down, so you have to use both hands to get it up again. There is no ""one finger"" way of operating this thing."
5,performed beyound expectations!!,"Upon receiving the Metro Vacuum Master Blaster, I immediatly proceeded to wash my vehicles. The air pressure was excellent on either setting and the warm air pressure ensured a ""streak free"" ultimate shine!!!I would recommend this to any car buff who regularily cares for your vehicles, absolutly no towels required."
4,Great with Reservations,"This unit really blows rhe water off any car. However, I chose to mount it on the wall and use 2 10 foot hose extensions for a total of 30 feet. The rubber connectors that are supplied to join the hose sections tend to blow off from the air pressure. This is a major problem that requires redesign. I have contacted Metro about the problem and am waiting for an answer."
4,Title,"I had a 3-socket octopus that worked well for me, but my sweetie took it. So I looked for a replacement and, finding none, bought this 4-socket. I like it a little better: it takes up less space, because my Camry dash has an inverted flat where it fits very nicely; although three of the sockets are suitable only for low-power devices, it has one socket that contains the bi-metal grasper needed to work a lighter; the lighter socket will accept high-current devices, like my Coleman fridge.The only negative is the mounting, and that's only a half star. It comes with a plastic plate that snaps on/off; this has a large double-stick foam pad, which, when pressed firmly to the clean, de-greased surface of my dash, held well. Until it was exposed to the heat of my sun-baked Toyota for a full work day. So, I (reluctantly) used the provided little-bitty wood screws (two) and it's holding so far."
5,Top Gear Episode 16 is great,This is another great season from TopGear. I have been watching them since season 5 and every year they get better. Great show the balances cars and talk show perfectly together.
3,so-so,"This season had some great shows, but not one of their best seasons. The Middle East Special episode was my favorite of this season. Episode two where they take on Top Gear Australia hosts was my second favorite."
4,purchased season 16 instant amazon,pretty good deal on season 16 Top Gear. Episode one was ok. Package comes with 6 episodes and 2 special episodes... well worth the price.
3,Doubloe episode,I was really excited to get this because since my boyfriend brought home a few series last year I am totally addicted. This is is very good season but my issue is they are selling it as 7 episodes and 2 specials. However episode 1 and the USA special are the exact same thing just put in the season twice. I would still have bought it if they sold it as 6 episodes but it makes me angry they would do something like this. Unless I got a really screwy DVD since episodes 2 and 3 are correct then I just think it is a bit ridiculous they did this.
5,That psycho-bitch got me hooked on Top Gear!,I had a psycho GF last year that introduced me to the original British version of Top Gear and Im hooked! The American version sucks in my eyes anymore. My son is now interested in watching the DVDs... Im proud :)
5,Eureka!,"I have been waiting on this CD for years. This is a reissue of an old London Records release (with several tunes added) featuring Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears, John Shirley-Quirk, et al, each having been friends of Grainger's and old hands at performing his music. The vinyl has been out of print for years (still have my old copy) and it's very much like finding a dear old friend, well-preserved and even more delightful than one remembered. The settings are superb, the performances sublime and the choice of material inspired. This is one of my two favorite Grainger albums, the other being an old Everest release of Duo-Art piano rolls of himself (PAG) playing, peerlessly, a wonderful selection of his and others' tunes and now available on Nimbus Records: catalog NI 8809. It's probably better engineered than the Everest, but my ears are still tuned in to the older sonority."
3,invalid formulas,"Correct me if I am wrong but looking at the definitions for assessment ratios they are defined as appraised price (P) * assessment ratio (R) = assessed value (A) so restating this as P * R = A then R = A / P which is not consistent with the book. The book states that R = P / A which is invalid. If you take the example of asked price which for this example lets say it is the appraised price of $107,500 and assessed value of A = 90000. If you use the formula of R = A / P then the ratio is 83.7% if you run the numbers defined in the book formula you get 1.194444444444. Other than that, the book has been very good at figuring the value of a given property. This also applies to the Assessment ratio adjusted.Here is the reference I found for defining the assessment ratio http://co.laplata.co.us/asrinfo.htm"
4,Handy reference guide,"I ordered this book for my business library and and happy with it, athough it does have some errors in it. However, the material is informative enough to undersatnd, which allows me to perform the calculations in it."
1,A bit cliched,"A grown man with a daughter must obey his father? I had a hard time believing a man who loved his daughter would give her a name like, Teal, too! Loveless arranged marriages, time travel...nothing new here"
1,Love how these look but....,"I was so excited when I saw these dispensers! I thought they would be perfect for my in-laws! But I ordered them twice and both times they were shattered! My husband and I have decided not to try for a third time, even though we really loved them:("
5,Excellent,Excellent overview of crime and punishment in ancient Egypt. Well documented. Probably of more interest to scholars.
4,Great book! But illustrations are not loading on my MAC and iphone,"This is a great book for leaders who want to make a difference in governance.However, the illustrations are not loading on my MAC and iDevices."
3,"so, so...An Okay scent","I prefer Lacoste essentials, but the red was good just seemed a little muted and old fashioned...not really my fav"
2,Sweet but extremely short,"There is no doubting that this cologne has an amazing smell, I put it on and it smells fantastic. It seems like the scent develops, grows into an even better smell after a little bit of putting it on. Which is why I'm so disappointed that the smell lasts almost no time at all. I put it on, feel and smell great, and 10 minutes later I smell my wrists/ chest and there is no longer any type of scent.I spray one or 2 squirts onto my chest and rub it in, mixes well with shirts and from my experience girls absolutely love it. My other colognes can leave a scent in the shirt for quite a while, the better ones sitting in for a week or so. This spray doesn't even hold in the cloth.I don't know if it's the bottle or not, because there are several reviews that say it lasts and smells great forever. I've tried multiple times and I just cannot get it to stay for more than 10 minutes. It's really frustrating because this is honestly one of the best scents I've owned in a while."
3,REALLY WEAK,"I've been through many other cologne reviews and in lots of them I see people complaining about the fragrences quality.Although I've been really surprised with the amazing scent, I must say that in less than 2 hours the smell is all gone.My box arrived with no plastic coat enclosing what I've found strange, but prefered to keep instead of returning the item.Next time I'll buy from perfumania."
2,TOO WEAK OF A SCENT! DISAPPOINTED BY LACOSTE,"THIS FRAGRANCE WAS PURCHASED BY ME AND FOR MYSELF TO USE, HOWEVER THIS SPECIFIC LACOSTE RED FRAGRANCE LET ME DOWN DRASTICALLY. I AM A FAN OF THE FIRST ORIGINAL LACOSTE GRAY SINCE IT WAS FIRST SPRAYED ONTO MY SKIN. THE SMELL PLUS THE LASTING EFFECT WAS SUPERB! BUT THE LACOSTE RED COLOGNE WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HAD A GREAT SCENT, THE LAST EFFECT WAS MAYBE 25-30 MINUTES IF SPRAYED WITH A HIGH AMOUNT. THIS LACOSTE RED DID NOT STAY ON ME FOR LONG AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW."
5,Great Value! Fantastic Smell,I found this product at Macys which was about $60 and my husband loved it. The price on here was too hard to pass up so I bought it. I love the way my husband smells because the scent has a very male smell with a twist of freshness like fruit. I also like it because the smell is not overly strong. Would buy again!
5,awesme & original!!!,Great add on gift for one of my friends and great price!! This is an original item since I've been wearing this cologne myself for years and I hae encounter a lot of fakes on amazon... so if your loking for a great bargain on a cologne that smells amazig... here you go!
5,Great Cologne,Great cologne at a great price. Fast shipping as well. I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for an expensive cologne at an inexpensive price.
3,Look around,"Seemed like an older bottle, faded packaging, and the fragrance seemed somewhat stale. I'd recommend another site or buying locally."
2,"Older woman perfume, smells like Ciara",I am 27 and I love most perfumes however I was disappointed when I received this one in the mail. Definitely an older woman smell. Smells like powdery 70's perfume alot like Ciara.
5,Best Ever,"This product is one of the best, I have used this product for years and get great response from not only my friends and co-worker but also my girls."
5,"So good, and so hard to find!","This has always been my husband's ""signature scent,"" but I have warned him he better find a new one because my sources for Safari for Men are disappearing rapidly. Assuming you're reading this review because you're thinking of buying it, and assuming Amazon has it in stock, I'd recommend you go for it...you may not get another chance."
3,SOUND NOT QUITE,THE RECORDING QUALITY WAS VERY POOR ON SOME SONGS.IT APPEARS THE SONGS WERE NOT RESTORED. THE SONGS ARE OVER 50 YEARS OLD AND THE RECORDINGS SOUND THAT OLD.
3,MENS COLOGNE,THE RECEIVER OF THE GIFT SAID IT DID NOT SMELL REAL!!NOT SURE IF I WILL ORDER COLOGNE FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
1,It seams to be made in China not in Paris,"I am using this product for more than 10 years, and I bought it before through Amazon, but unfortunatelly in this occation I do not think this is original."
1,fake cologne,this product was terrible and i will never order from them again..I ordered issey miyake for men and I got a fake version of cologne that broke me out plus when I received the package it was spilled in the box and the issey miyake label was peeling off the bottle
1,dont smell like the original,"i have almost 4 year using this perfum, inmediatly open i see the top leak perfum, and the smell was a garbage, im disgusting with amazon i will never to buy a perfum again in amazon, i lost a much money. the companies must to have responsability, how i can buy garbage for 80 dolars."
1,lost fragrance!,"I bought this perfume several times, but this does not have the same fragrance than the others ..."
1,Yuck,"I can't believe people are still wearing this cologne. I bought it, and didn't even make it through 1/3 of the bottle. It honestly smells like lemon-scented Windex. There are much better scents out there."
1,danaged product received and no satisfaction from vendor,"Amazon had Designer Shops send me the ordered product. I received it late and damaged. The product, men's cologne, was leaking but the bottle was not broken. I contacted the vendor, Designer Shops, who informed me that I would be credited for the worthless item. It has not occurred and now I have to seek a resolution from my credit card by disputing the charge. I am dissatisfied with the product and will not purchase items of a similar nature from Amazon in the future due to the vendors Amazon selects."
1,Leaking bottle,Think twice before purchasing this product. At some point the metal top is going to start leaking which happened to me. It is a decent smelling cologne though.
1,this object has not reached,"By hereby inform you that this object has not reached the destination address you put in this order, please help me to find this spray. thanks."
1,horrible,"It honestly smells a lot like that Axe body spray stuff. Simply horrible. I got a sample vial and gave it to my boyfriend and he refused to wear it, with good reason."
2,the button does not work,as the butoon does not work its waste of money for me investing on this perfume...
5,Deceiving and Unbelievable!,"This perfume is simply deceiving at first. It starts with Tangy Citrus / Eucalyptus blast. But within something like half an hour it turns quite floral/spicy. Very little touch of wood till now. Then comes the most delightful dry down(Spices,mild tobacco,sandal). This is really a timeless perfume and i would say is a tad bit ahead of Aqua Di Gio in terms of freshness. Just got a 4.2 oz from Amazon. Simply the best fragrance in the world! Kudos to the genius who created it."
4,Very nice smell.,"Very good cologne, length of smell is fair. Smells of citrus and spice. I believe good cologne for anytime of day or night."
5,great product,I bought this product for my husband for Christmas and hhe loves it and wears it everyday to work and out for dinner.
3,What to look out for when buying this,"I bought this product here 6 months ago. I've noticed that mine was mixed with water. It's definitely not a fake, but They just added water. There's some that don't have water mixed in, and some that do. Since mine was mixed with water, it wasn't long-lasting like how it should be, and the scent was weaker."
4,Seems like the real thing,I have worn this for years and love the smell... As does everybody else. Came in great packaging and looked original. May have been a tad old though because it had a xmas tree decoration inside and it was not close to xmas. But who cares right. Better than paying $80 at the mall.
4,Liked it very much!!!!,You'll love it if you like the kind of perfumes like Aqua Di Gio. Can be used for business and evening parties.
1,FAKE!!!!,"It came very fast, no lies about that, but that is not 100% authentic product. It does not smell exactly like the real one. I can also tell that the bottle is slightly different. Why are you selling products as 100%authentic?"
5,PERFUMES ORIGINALES,UNA FRAGANCIA TOTALMENTE ORIGINAL SE LAS RECOMIENDO YA Q HAY MUCHOS VENDEDORES Q VENDEN IGUAL DE CAROS Y FRAGANCIAS CHIMBAS HUELEN A PURO ALCOHOL
1,Fake,"The product came in the perfect looking box, but leaked while laying under the christmas tree. Come to find out the top metal seal had been taken off, the bottle filled with fake cologne then resealed. I should have known price was too good to be true for Issey Miyake!"
1,I have been waiting for over a month for this product to arrive. i still havent received it !!!!,"I oredered two different colognes from this company, the first order was cancelled because they didnt have the cologne, even after advertising it. the second cologne it has been over a month and i still havent received it."
3,Wear It in the Summer,"Beware, you do not need a lot of it. It is very citrus/metallic in nature. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice cologne, but can be overwhelming if you use too much."
1,"Not happy, cologne not the real Issey Miyake","I received this Issey Miyake cologne and immediately i noticed the bottle is labeled differently. which I suspected since the site made note of that. Then I smelled it, and it is not the Real Issey Miyake, but a imitation. I compared it with with my brother's real Issey Miyake and the real stuff smells stronger. This stuff smells so light. and it does not last! I spray it on and it only lasts 10 min, then its gone. I'm very disappointed. This must either be a fake or a oversea import. I assume I cannot return it since I have used it once already. If the seller lets me return this, I will give a better comment. but right now, I'm am not a happy customer, definitely feel cheated."
5,i love it!,been loving it for years. just got another bottle. perfect for the ladies man type of guy....feel me?
4,My boyfriend loves this!,"However, I do not. It is okay. I got him Kenneth Cole Black, which I think is similar but better and he prefers Issey.You know what they say about smells and memories. I hope he is not associating this scent with someone else!"
4,Great everyday scent,"This is a great everyday scent. I blind bought this based on what I have heard from other buyers. This isn't my favorite fragrance but it is a good quality scent. I suggest you try this before buying. Very safe fragrance that will not offend anyone. You can wear this to work at the office, or on a casual day running errands/shopping.. etc."
5,Powerful,This scent starts out powerful but calmly adjust shortly after spraying on. My husband had not heard of this cologne before and so i thought i'd give him a new experience since he loves colognes. He loved it and wears it often now.
1,The lid and the sprayer cap were defected ... leading to faster evaporation,When opening the top lid the sprayer cap came off attached to the lid. Somehow I began noticing fluid leaking through evaporation. I replaced the cap immediately. But every time I open (remove lid) the small cap comes off and have to put back in to spray.I have been using this cologne for over 13 years. It is terrible to see the quality problems experienced thus far.
2,Folding cot,We wanted to have a folding cot/bed for guests that could be stored without taking up too much room in the closet. We found it took two people to set it up and you had to be careful you didn't cut off your fingers doing it. The cot is large and VERY flat. No give to the fabric. Was not comfortable for one to sleep on being that stiff. If you put a plush pad on top it might help. One would want to pull this out for the guest you did not want to stay at your home too many nights. Must say it was easy to store in the closet because it didn't take up much space. Have since gone to an inflatable air bed for guests.
3,Average bar,"When I ordered this bra I thought it would be more substantial with more coverage. It is almost see-through and has a very light padding. It also crinkles on the top of the cup, so I can't wear it with body hugging clothing. I kept it because it is comfortable, even though it does not fit my needs. I just wear it with loose or dark clothes."
5,Awesome support!,"Over the years I have tried many different bras, but the Olga Signature support is by far the best I have ever tried. These are the only bras I wear now and have gotten rid of my VS bras. Too bad these are now discontinued and can only be bought through Amazon.com."
5,Anastasia-A Magical Movie as well as a magical book!,"Okay, first things first! As a huge fan of Anastasia I of course purchased this book, and I see that all of these older people are giving anything Anastasia related a bad rap. I bet if it were a storybook for the 1956 version of Anastasia they wouldn't be so judgmental. This book has lush poem-like text and really beautiful breathtaking paintings/pictures that aren't reproductions but drawn special just for this book. The cover is also really beautiful and sparkly. It could be used as bedtime reading though it is a little short but anyone ANY age could read this and enjoy it too.People need to look past the fact that this movie is based on the REAL Anastasia Nicholaievna Romanov {Who I know much about as well as her family!} And just accept the MOVIE itself for what it is, not it's true history, which it is not!"
1,Kids are going to believe this!,"I haven't read the book, I couldn't get past the historical innacuracies in the description. The first mistake is the title. Anastasia was not a princess, but a grand duchess. A grand duchess outranked a princess. This may only be a minor detail, but if we're going to present this to kids as history it needs to be accurate. Unfortunately all of the Anastasia books I've looked at have similar and worse problems."
4,Rock Quarry Track Great Mountain not so hot,"Add batteries and nothing happens.The track and set is great and sturdy, you get lots of stuff in the set, but don't expect the battery operated explosion or sound effects to work. We purchased it with the train table and recieved a 50% off promo, even at a great price it's still disappointing. Managed to get it back in the box whew !!Drove 45 miles the day after Christmas to exchange it for another and still add batteries and nothing happens...Boo..The mountain should be recalled."
4,"Once you figure out the battery issue, it's a bargain","We bought this used from my niece, along with a train table. Actually, she just threw it in and said it never worked. I looked it up here just to see how to put the track together. Lo and behold, I read the reviews, got some Rayovac batteries and voila! Works like a dream. My 2 1/2 year old twin boys LOVE it. (My niece laughed when I told her about it.)"
1,BOOO to Imaginarium,"Like everyone else I'm miffed. Try explaining to a three year old why the new toy ---that they're so excited to receive --- doesn't work. From reading these reviews, I've --thankfully-- found out it's probably the batteries. Do they have R&D; in China? Does Toys-R-Us test any of the products their Product Buyer suggests? I don't mind getting and using specific batteries, but it is the company's responsibility to inform the public. I will think long and hard before buying any Imaginarium product again.Shame Imaginarium. Shame Toys-R-Us."
1,Rock Quarry-r-us-...,"The rock quarry stinx. If I have to go find a certain battery that works, then I want to know why. Does the manufactorer also make the batteries or own stock in that company??? It is ridiculous. Instead, I have decided to hold an implosion of the rock mountain in front of my home. This way I will get more enjoyment than the frustration I have felt trying to figure out a 3 year olds malfunctioning toy. I will never buy a product from this company again."
2,Angry parent!!,"I have tryed several batteries but not rayovac. The mountain does not work. For those that tought they had gotten one that had been return because of only one instruction sheet, this is correct. I have a table from the same company imaginarium, it it horrible. It is the one with 6 bins underneath. I have called them 6 times and have gotten parts but they are too broken. So t I called the # for imaginarium. They said they are no longer making it. So why are they still selling it. Toysrus has many in there overstock and need to unload, since they were on sale. You can call like I did they are sendind me a lifting bridge, if it works. Or return for soming new. ."
3,Rock Quarry Did Not Work,"I recently purchased the Rock Quarry set for my 2.5 year old son. I am upset that on December 23rd we did a test to see if everything worked, and sure enough the Rock Blaster does not.I will try the different batteries and we will see."
2,Exploding Parents Instead of Mountain,"The rock quarry set is made mostly out of wood, it seems ok. Some of the tracks however are not cut perfectly, so some tracks are hard to get the tongue & groove to come together.The mountain does not explode. We tried new batteries from 2 different new packs of Duracell batteries. In the box there wasn't any customer service phone number to call about getting the mountain mechanism replaced (we weren't going to pack up all 64+ pieces to stand in a return line at TOYSRUS just to get another defective set). I want to thank all of you for your reviews, otherwise I would not know to try the Rayovac batteries, I'm going to pick some up today. Does anybody know the customer service number and address for Imaginarium so that I may let them know about this issue? Such a dissapointment for the kids (and me) on Christmas morning."
3,I had the same problem with mountain and batteries,"I loaded up the quarry with some new alkaline batteries right out of the box and it didn't work either. I went to trade in the defective (so I thought) mountain and blaster set, but when I tried a new one there at the store with my batteries it didn't function either. The store manager and employees informed me that some types of batteries don't work with certain toys, they gave me some Ray-o-vac plus batteries and it worked just fine with both sets. I don't know which other kinds of batteries will work, but otherwise it's an O.k. set for the price."
3,Not a toy but a great stepping stone to a fun hobby.,"First of all this price is a bargin. I bought mine at a local hobby shop for about $40. It is not much to look at when you open the box - a wooden frame, a wood hook needle, burlap fabric and some yarn. But the instructions are good and if you understand then off you go.The great part about this project is that it is quick. If you like it then you can pick up some inexpensive yarn and burlap fabric and make your own designs.I would invest in a real hoop to keep the fabric tight. The wood frame needs tacks (not included!) to tack down the fabric and it is a bit loosy-goosy, which could frustrate a child. Also the colors where not exact-like featured on the box-which could also frustrate a child."
3,expensive,"This is pretty expensive for what you get. The overall finished product is pretty small, but fun to complete. I love rug hooking and this kit is great for beginners. I t comes with the burlap, which is already marked with design lines, the hook and the yarn. It also has a wooden frame, but you need to have either push pins or staples to tack burlap to the frame. I used push pins and they fell out alot, so I would recommend taking the time and using a staple gun. It was a very fun and easy project, but the yarn is very limited, they only give you a very little amount of each color, so i actually ran out of one color,and had to use another shade. There was no left over yarn at all. It was much smaller then I though it would be, but did turn out cute when I was done. It gives the look of a primitive look, which i love. But for the price I wish it would have been larger."
3,Toy?,"I did not purchase this item as a toy. It was for me to see if I might enjoy traditional rug hooking.I have not started the project. Product was not what I expected it to be, but then maybe I didn't read the description well enough.Delivery, etc. and the handling of the order was just fine. Rating based only on my current interest level in completing the project.It is cute."
4,cool video with a message,"This DVD has the uncut version of Where Are We Runnin'. In it, you have scenes of nudity (including Lenny's behind) and drug use, but is done to show the result of excess in one's life (whether it's sex or drugs). It is done well and makes it's point. Another point is that this video is hardly shown on TV, and when it is, it's always cut short. Here you get it in it's entirety.Other than the video, there's a ten-minute behind-the-scenes look at the making of Baptism. Here you hear how Lenny came up with the songs and his drive for perfection. A short, but well-shot look behind-the-scenes. Definitely worth a look."
4,"Rough bowing, smoothe bowing","It is interesing to contrast this recording of Carter's Second and Third quartets with that of the Juilliard--both are excellent and worth owning, but this one underscores the stylistic continuity of the two pieces in rather a startling fashion. Where Mann and company offer a warm, almost Mozartean rendering of the Second and dig into the Third as hard as they can, Arditti and friends give a comparatively robust reading of the Second and a smoother reading of the Third. I daresay the latter is almost mellifluous, especially in the scorrevole passages. One can see how one quartet sprang from the other. They sound like the offspring of a single mind, rather than contrasting evolutions from different planets.The Elegy is a bonus and a treat-- a pretty piece from Carter's neoclassical period, much in the mood of Barber's Adagio, but with more muscle and greater contrast in tempos and textures.All in all, a worthy addition to the Carter discography."
5,"Great Price, Great Product",This is a great set of modern day wine glasses. They are elegant but durable in the top rack of the dishwasher and less likely to break because they are stemless. A great price and value.
2,Could Have Waited Another Five Years,"I was and am disappointed with this CD. It has some phenomenal names from the world of contemporary blues and yet it fails to to tug at the emotional chords to any real extent. The only tracks that work compltetely are John Lee Hooker's ""Thought I Heard"" and Isaac Hayes's ""Soulsville,"" the latter of which isn't even blues. Pops Staples's ""Why Am I Treated So Bad"" and Terry Evans's ""Get Your Lies Straight"" are both interesting treatments, but they both ultimately fail because they are too pretentiously homey to be taken seriously. ""Get Your Lies Straight"" is at least intentionally self-mocking with its reference to 'a gang of politicians,' but ""Why Am I Treated So Bad"" is an indulgent treatment of Martin Luther King that pales on repeated listens. The several other tracks on the CD are basically unmemorable, and Pointblank Records should have tried to find tracks that grip the listener before they issued this CD."
4,telescope and microscope,"First I have to say my grandson was only semi interested in telescopes and microscopes. He did use it a few times, but his interest was lost because of having to set up the microscope and adjust the light angle and whatever. He is age 11, so I probably should have waited until he was a little older. The product itself seems sturdy enough and the telescope worked fine."
4,For anyone full of inquiry and seeking discovery!,"With Christmas celebration for our grandson came stocking stuffers, toys, robot cars and sleds... but lurking behind all that glamor was this microscope and telescope. And soon after breakfast and a breather from all that was scattered on the floor was this one box, just begging to be opened and explored.Easy to assemble, with wonderful pre-prepared slides, the microscope grabbed his attention right away. Then came the telescope, offering a wondrous view of Puget Sound at daybreak.Of all the things received this Christmas morning, this gift remained atop the kitchen table -- a place he visited time after time all day long.A great gift for an inquisitive almost-6-year-old full of adventure and discovery!"
4,When one's ideals were most important,"Set in Kentucky in 1795, schoolmaster John Gray falls in love with Amy Falconer, a silly girl - but it is really her aunt Jessica he truly loves. He is a man inspired by ideals - his great fault, in a way, because he misses the human side of people (and himself) because of them. But Jessica is already married, and though she loves Gray back, nothing comes of it. The book is sad and uplifting at the same time."
5,"""The Choir Invisible"" was wonderfully intriguing ,wholesome","I enjoyed reading ""The Choir Invisible"" because in an age where ""The Right Thing To Do"" is an antique, and ""Play now pay later"" philosophy reigns supreme , it's good to see someone have the courage of their convictions. Totally enthralling!!!!"
5,very good live cd,"Now when i got this cd i didn't notice it was a live cd. When i got home i gave it a chance and it was really, really good. They have a alot of my favorites like ""shame on a *****"" and ""c.r.e.a.m."" and thats just naming a couple. Wu-tang did a really good job live. They rap well on this one definetly get this one for your collection. Wu-tang forever RIP Russell jones(ol' dirty bastard)."
5,Wu Fans Unite!!!,"Anyone, and I mean anyone who is a Wu Tang fan NEEDS to get this album. Just the fact that it's got everyone, including ODB, is enough to get it. But, this album, from the second I popped it in my CD player, had my head bobbin!!! Some might say, ""I already got all these songs"", that was me at first, but once I got it, though, I understood why I had to have it. I couldn't even tell you which song I liked best, they're all bangin', like you'd expect from the Wu. The only thing I didn't like, was that I couldn't have been there at the concert, it woulda been off the hook, more than that even. I would give this album 10 stars if I could. Like I said in the beginning, all hip hop heads NEED to get this album"
3,3.5 Stars Actually,"The Wu has been doin it for over a decade. They have their problems like any family but when they all hooked up in California for a concert with all nine original members it was on. This album is a good mix of everything the clan has done solo and group wise, the only problem is that when it comes to group tracks they only do one or two verses of them instead of performing the whole song. This is disappointing to anyone who knows classic lines from all the members on different tracks. I think the DVD of this show would be better but it still is a good live album from possibly the most influential group in hip-hop history."
1,"Hip Hop live, I don't think so","I am a hard core Wu fan, but like most hip hop artist live concerts are bad. First off I would never go, and second the quality of the music and the harmony are really bad, no exception here.Wu is great but stick to studio Cd's not live."
1,Sultry Asian Princess can't sing worth a hoot.,"Miss Wu-Tang is certainly quite pretty, but she is so lacking in singing talent that on this CD she is reduced to merely chanting some semi-rhyming stuff about guns and b*tches and ghetto life. This misconceived project is surely the result is an ill-advised effort to capture the urban youth market. I think she missed her true calling. She should have stuck to dancing and let those who can sing sing."
1,ripping off avril,these p*ssies just ripping off avril lavigne with their bs beats and chickensh*t rimes. avril did it first and she did it better. they be real f*cking lucky they where she cant get at them cuz they would P!SS their pants if she ever come after them. dont buy this ripoff album from ripoff rappers. get the REAL getto stuff from avril! just LET GO!
1,received wrong item,"I orderd the version with Peter Cushing as advertised on this website. I received the version with Jeremy Brett instead. I didn't bother to return it as the postage each way ended up being near the amount of the DVD. Not pleased with the switch, but expedient to just forget it."
2,"Thick book, not many useful pages","This book covers most areas of engineering, as advertised. However, I find it doesn't have enough depth to allow you to solve real world problems in a field of engineering one is familiar with, while at the same time, doesn't give enough background to allow you to make good use of the formulae in fields that you may be new to. In other words, it is written somewhat obtusely. That's fine if one just needs a refresher of what one has learned before or elsewhere, but makes it difficult to use in a new area."
1,Terrible,"This was a terrible adapter. Not only were the instructions not clear (you need keep your fingers away from the top of the small cassette when pushing the slider door back up, because the top part of the small cassette has to flip up), but it only worked on 3 tapes. Removing the tape is difficult because you really need three hands to take it out (flip it over, hold the side button, flip the top up, and press on the white spool of the cassette to push it out, while also trying to keep the slider door from closing. After doing this with three tapes (all the while concerned that I not push too hard so I don't break anything), the fourth (and subsequent tapes) wouldn't load because the part of the small cassette that is supposed to flip up couldn't because the adapter pulled the tape out too soon, and it couldn't clear it. Arrrggh! What a hassle and a waste of money. Spend a little extra and get one of the motorized ones (borrowed my brother's, which works SO much better that I bought one)."
1,Horrible product,"This company needs to stop making this product because they don't know how. I bought this product and at first couldn't get the tape to fit and the door to close. After 30 min I got the tape in but the adaptor wouldnt pull the tape up so you could view it in the VCR. I had to manually adjust it. I returned it for the motarized kind with the same brand. The tape loaded easily but when I went to play it, there was static all over the tapes and you couldn't see it. When I was returning this product as well, the guy at Best Buy said it wasn't a well made product. So why sell it???Don't waste your time, find a different brand that is a higher quality."
2,Cassette adaptor,I did not realize that not all vcr's played this adapter. I had an old one and tried to play some home movies and discovered that my old one wouldn't work any more. So I ordered this one and One of my players barely plays it for me. I am going to transfer all my videos to DVD's.. I hope they work out. The old one used to work like a regular video so I don't know what happened.
3,1997 explorer,"This harness is only good to restore an oem radio connetion,not install a aftermarket radio into you vehicle without cutting the factory harness as I assumed it would.quailty conncetors , just not what I needed."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Very basic rotor. Appears very cheaply made compared to the OE on my wife's Pathfinder. That said, I installed it as part of a major tune up of that vehicle and it works. Will see how durable it is.. Should be included as part of a set with a distributor cap. Why you have to buy seperately I'll never know."
5,Mountain Mistress,"Mountain Mistress was an extremely sexy, wonderful romance. The hero purchases the heroine from indians (she is innoncent still). He makes her his Mountain Bride. I loved it!!! Yes, against her wishes....He loves her deeply and will give her anything, except her freedom. THe heroine gives her virginity to him under duress, but falls madly in love with him. It is a book that has been underaated but you WILL NOT regret reading it. I have read and re-read this book at least 15 times. Get a copy. It is a definite KEEPER. I would rate it a ten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You'll enjoy every single page. Happy reading!!!!!"
5,"WHERE ARE THEY, NOW???","They were here for TOO short of a season! This is a group where babies can be made, arguements can be ammended, and reflection can take place. My God, I love those guys!! Enough said!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST R&B ALBUMS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS,"It's unbelievable how underrated this album (group) is. i still get the same emotions i felt listening to this album the first time i listened to it 10 years ago. Frankly no other R&B album has done this to me since. ""How do you tell the one"" is so true and real and you even ""feel"" the emotions thru the lyrics and beautifully blended voices. And as if that's not enough, you'll get that on each and every track. Now that's what I call music This CD is amazing!!!!!! Buy this CD....BUY THIS CD NOW!!!"
4,Hirst,Book is in excellent condition. I am very thankful and satisfied because I contacted the seller for expedited delivery. I was going overseas and needed the book. The book arrived way ahead of time and it did not cost me extra. I recommend purchasing from this seller without question.
1,Cheap and disappointing,"The book was disappointing. Not just the ""suicidal"" recommendations part, but childish poorly performed pop-ups and pretty cheap ""pull out"" features.Actually I was more interested in Hirst's works before I saw this book than I am now."
3,Ok!,"I was looking at my old Little Golden books trying to find a book that my niece might like to have read to her and Alice in Wonderand Meets the White Rabbit is one of my old books it is ok but not one of my favorites, I probably liked this book when I was little even though I don't remember reading it or having it read to me, this condensed version based on the movie that was Disney's take on the Lewis Carroll classic is ok for little kids who the Lewis Carroll books may be too long and even too scary but it's not a book that stood out in my memory like some other Little Golden book classics like The Little Red Hen, Puppy On The Farm, The Kitten-Sitters etc."
4,A Disney Classics holds new value today,"Lewis Carroll's original masterpiece was given a new face when Walt Disney brought it to life back in 1959. Not only did he remind us of an extraordinary story forgotten by some, but he also used the pictures that the words of the story painted in our charmed and mystified minds, to create the sort of picture that you can share with others. While Disney's mental pictures may differ from those of our own, they were full of his whimsy and magic. Less cartoon-ish than those in the movie, the illustrations which are in this book, have more elegance and grace. It not only provides true ""eye-candy"" but it gives a wonderful shortened version of that which is shown in the animated motion picture. It really is an exellent piece and something everyone who was as charmed by the movie as i was should see if not own."
4,Good debut,"CJ Mac delivers a quality cd for his debut. He was already 30 when it came out but it has some tight west coast beats and he tells his stories well. He gets on the young players in the game saying he been bangin since '79 and used to get birds for $4300. It has a few classics and doesn't feature many people (one song w/ Poppa LQ & 2 chorus sung by some woman). No real weak spots. Neveretheless it is a good CD and a must have for gangsta rap west coast fans.#2 - 7#3 - 10 (a classic w/ a tight beat)#4 - 10 (another classic w/ a tight beat - f/ Poppa LQ)#5 - 7#6 - 8.5 (talkin' about soft ""gangstas"")#7 - 9.5 (great song w/ a long intro)#8 - 8#9 - 8#10 - 7#11 - 7#13 - 8 (talkin' bout snitches)Bryan Ross -- b. 1965 -- Los Angeles, CAcheck all my reviews"
2,disappointing,"First of all, I am a huge Indigenous fan. Mato Nanji is simplyincredible. However, this album is a disaster. It is not in thesame league as Circle or Things We Do. The recording quality isappalling for a modern recording. It is heavily compressed anddistorted. Indigeous should dump the Davey Brothers as theirproducers. I have all Indigenous recordings including their EPCDs and their video DVD. This album is by far the worst of thelot. Please come back to your senses Mato. P.S. Indigenous isjust great live. Don't miss them if they come to your town."
2,Boring,"More boring than I thought after watching the Experience Hendrix DVD. Couple of good tracks, though."
2,The bad reviews are right... bummer.,"There's no question that this is one of the worst ""sounding"" albums I've ever heard. I guess it's an MP3 world & maybe if you are used to listening to lo fi sound through $5 headphones you might not realize this.Unfortunately this band, which started so strong, has been getting worse with every release. I saw them live last year & while Mato Nanji can play... he's really the great blues hope right now... the band sucked, going for volume and Hendrix licks over feel. The Hendrix thing might go over in a bar & draw a lot of hoots, but there's a whole lot of bands doing that trick. Nanji needs to step away from the family band for a while & play with some other guys... and focus on his own thing.They'll have a hard time giving this one away, but maybe that's for the best."
1,"This record stinks, they don't.","Dude who thought Indigenous stunk live must have seen a really bad show or maybe just dont get it. They rock live, Mato is the best. Something went really wrong with this record - I don't know what but I kow I dont' like it at all. See them live for yourself and decide for yourself."
5,GREAT BLUES ROCK!!!,"I FIRST HEARD OF THIS GROUP ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO FROM A FRIEND.SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN.INDIGENOUS IS IN GREAT FORM ON THIS ONE RIGHT FROM THE STARTING TRACK.THIS BAND HAS ALOT OF TALENT AND CAN REALLY GROOVE.I FEEL THAT THIS IS THEIR BEST WORK. ALOT OF STEVIE RAY AND JIMI IN THERE WITH A GREAT STRAT NECK PICKUP SOUND ON ALOT OF THE CUTS.THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND MATO HAS A GREAT VOICE.STAND OUT TRACKS? ALL OF THEM !! BUY THIS CD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. ALOT OF GREAT HARD BLUES WITH ALOT OF SOUL .WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY, GET IT TODAY!!"
2,1st 3 CD's were there best,"I would have to say, I also prefer their earlier, pre Davey brothers material. Circle and The Things we do are excellent. But since the Davey Bothers have become invloved with production and song writing. I feel they have lost some of the edge they previously had. This CD and the previous EP CD available thru their website, have a poorly mixed sound. They still are a solid band, but I hope they go back to writing their own material and leave the Davey brothers behind."
3,"Not bad work, but horrific production","This is my first shot at Indigenous. While I like some of the cuts very much, I am extremely disappointed at the quality of the recording. It reminds me of a bootleg. I am hoping that they improve their sound tech for their future work."
1,Saw em' live.. they stunk,"I saw these guys open for Jonny Lang in Boston and they sucked.. worse band I've ever seen live.. Lang was fantastic. The sound quality will never be good, because they don't play that well.. The lead does have a good voice, I'll give them that.. but still, don't bother."
3,A wasted opportunity,"I was waiting for this new release with great expectation. The first Indigenous' album for a major label, mainly specialised in blues recording, was something for which you wouldn't have slept at night.Well, the result is at least (just to remain generous) ambiguous. The talent of Mato Nanji is I believe, indisputable, and he delivers throughout the album a marvellous job. Compared with previous works this one sound more blues than rock orientated even if the band still play ""hard"". What it is really annoying is the fact that the quality of the recording is so bad that it becomes really almost impossible to listening to the CD from start to finish. I am wondering who had the idea to produce a CD with such terrible sound. Is he still around? If yes please keep him away from Indigenous!"
2,A Letdown,"Yes, it's true that this band boasts one of the best guitarists in rock, an heir-apparent to Stevie Ray, if not Hendrix. But it's hard to carry a subpar album even with wicked guitar licks. ""C'mon Suzie"" is a great down-and-dirty blues rocker, maybe the best of its kind of the year, but after that the quality goes south in a hurry. The muddy, fuzzy production that made ""C'mon Suzie"" such a great leadoff track becomes monotonous after a while, and the group comes off sounding like not much more than an average bar band with a good guitarist. ""Things We Do"" was a better album. But if you are looking for a superior example of ethnic-flavored blues-rock, pick up ""Los Lonely Boys"" instead."
1,Stevie would have had a hard time listening to it,"I have never heard a ""major"" CD that souunded this bad. Did the Davey Brothers use a Edison Gramaphone to record it? Indigenousdeperately needs a good producer to sift out their weak material (3/4 of this CD) and make them sound good (like on their previous efforts). Theya re really great live and can do better than this."
3,"Great Blues Rock, Lousy Production","I am a big fan of blues rock and Indigenous is a diamond in the rough. However the Davey Brothers production on this disc is so tight it chokes the music to death. There is no air between the notes. Each track has the same sonic quality and doesn't come off as being very diverse. My ears hurt from a constant tonal quality that carries throughout the entire project. I'm sure these tunes will come out great live when they can breathe and evolve.Mato is an incredible guitarist and Pte, Horse and Wandbi could use a little space to show off their talents.Hopefully the next disc will allow more band presence.Peace......."
3,Didn't Work For Me,"After reading the reviews I decided to try this product. I have a 92 Lexus SC300 and I was getting ready to install an aftermarket JVC stereo and this adapter seemed to be the ticket. Unfortunately after I installed the JVC unit with this adapter, I had the same problem that other reviewers noted. The sound was extremely distorted and wasn't worth listening to. I removed the adapter harness and then wired the JVC stereo directly to the speakers, bypassing the OEM amplifier in the trunk that worked with the stock radio and CD. After doing that, the system works and sounds great. So, there is something about going through the OEM amplifier that did not work for me and I know the amplifier is not the problem because it was working fine before I removed the stock radio to install the JVC."
3,Be Aware.,This harness works just fine except for one thing. It does not have a dimmer circuit wire. I bought this for a Pioneer double din dvd unit for my Sequoia. I will have to do a little extra cutting and connecting in order to get the dimmer function to work. Not a big deal for me but it would be nice to not have to do it. I might be able to find the exact terminal size for the connector but not likely. ***INFO*** The dimmer wire looks for a voltage signal when the headlights come on. ***DO NOT GROUND YOUR DIMMER WIRE***
5,You can't get this in the UK,"I ordered this item from Amazon.com because it is not available in the UK. It is not expensive and delivery was reasonable (took about a week). The alternative to this, as I found out, was to lift the 20 pin connector from the original Toyota radio (this connector is virtually impossible to get anywhere), then search around for the pin out for the 20 pins. Not a trivial thing to do unless you are handy with a soldering iron."
2,Doesn't fit 2006 Highlander Hybrid with JBL,I bought this harness to install a new DVD Receiver in my Highlander Hybrid but it turns out that the harness doesn't fit.
3,Salvatore Ferragamo cologne,I just don't have a good feeling that the cologne I purchased is the REAL DEAL.The scent is very faint and it doesn't stay on me like before.
2,Expectations not met,I used this perfume earlier where I brought from perfumania and it was awsome. But the one frm amazon is not worthy enough and it's not looks original
1,Not very impressive.,"An old girlfriend of mine bought me the 3.4 oz as a gift. I wore it twice and she told me never to wear it again. I started wearing it again after we broke up, and NEVER received any compliments on it from women. You know this is a telltale sign of a mediocre cologne. Also look at how cheap it is now, and you can tell it's not very popular."
1,not real,first off it does not smell right... but secondly the reason why i know its fake is that it has all these brown things floating around in it!!! NASTY... Sending it back ASAP...
3,Multiple proof,How can so many people be wrong? Having become immersed in the Walters family experiences the fascination never wanes. But still the question remains - where are the decent photos? An engrossing read (if in a somewhat basic English) and another must for all ufologists and more. I need to get hold of more of the Walters books
3,"Ukraine, 2nd: The Bradt Travel Guide","This guide was helpful in planning and preparation for travel in the Ukraine. The many and varied tourist attractions are well presented. The coverage of local transportation could be improved and expanded, although the data presented is helpful. Recommended."
2,A Ukrainian who hasn't been there yet,"The ""Bradt"" Ukraine book helped to make my decision to journey to Italy, Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia with the information from my ""Lonely Planet"" book. I have used Lonely Planet before and found it great with pictures of what can be expected at the various destinations. The Bradt Ukraine had a few pages of mediocre pictures in the front and compared to my reading of the destinations I have chosen to travel to, failed to fire my imagination - which is a terrible pity because I am of Ukrainian heritage myself."
4,"Excellent Guide, Poor Maps","Comprehensive and detailed travel guide to Ukraine. My only complaint is that the maps are poor (usually printed across two opposing pages - which puts the center of each city right on the center seam; making the center of each map unuseable) and lack detail (Metro stops, e.g.)."
3,Not so great,"Having used to Lonely Planet's way of presentation which is systematic and easy flow. This book,though is informative but not so smooth flow for reading. Perhaps, I am too used to Lonely Planet's style after using their books for 20+ years."
4,Mixed : Lutsk / Mykolayiv,"Lots of helpful infomation covering history, religion, language and many cities, not just the capital. An appendix gives some basic vocabulary in Russian and Ukrainian. I visited Lutsk and Mykolayiv as well as Kiev in September of 2005.Information regarding Lutsk was helpful, however the review of Mykolayiv was unduely negative. I found the people there very hospitable and it was as nice as any other Ukrainian city. Mykolayiv has an excellent shipbuilding museum, some great musical talent, and the best zoo in the country.The book has only a few color photos, and the maps are B&W.; Color would have been nice on the Kiev metro transit map (which features a red, blue and green line). A future revision should identify the sites of the 'Orange Revolution' last winter (2004/2005)."
4,Invicta Abyss Automatic Dive Watch Red Dial 2939,"Excellent Solid watch.Goes with either Red/Pink shirt or Burgurndy Shoe.Little disadvantage is, you have to set it, any time you want to put it on, as it stops when you remove it off your wrist."
1,Junk,Bought with high hopes. Item started to cease working properly after using about 10 times. Stick with a good old fasioned sprinkler.
5,Great Product from Watering Made Easy.,"This product and company is the best. I have used these sprinklers in my yard for three years. They are easy to install, work great and the company is awesome to work with. You can not go wrong with this quality product."
5,Watering made easy,Great product. Easy to install and adjust to cover the areas you choose.I would recommend to anyone. I bought 4 original sprinkler stations and now placed an order for the square station to take care of flower beds.
5,This CD is one of the best I have ever heard.,"What can I say? When I first bought this CD, I hadn't heard much of the band, but the first time I listened to it, I knew it was something special. Brother Cane uses an extreme range of musical types from soft and sad (Voice of Eujena) to rocking rythems to catch the listener and hold them there until the CD is done. Mixing of the types of songs is also used very well. Sometimes sounding a bit folkie, sometimes sounding like a pure rock group, they always sound good. This is a necessary addition to anyone's collection."
5,"Great, Lost Alabama Classic","Unfortunately with Brother Cane's hiatus, the fans aren't able to hear anymore the music that makes you sing along to the guitar and bass parts. This is one of the best things about Brother Cane's music. You are not only left humming Damon Johnson's lyrics, but you can't help but find yourself singing along to his guitar work, humming to Roman Glick's bass, all the while tapping out (or trying to!) Scott Collier's intricate patters. (I shoould mention that Scott Collier, with his extensive use of African percussion and his great licks and rhythms is one of rock's best drummers). Go out and buy this album!"
4,"Very good but not as good as I, VAMPIRE","When rereading I, VAMPIRE, I was taken with desire to read more of David Parker. I rushed to the bookstore even while mid-read of I, VAMPIRE and grabbed the only other two books by Michael Romkey on the shelf: VAMPIRE HUNTER and THE VAMPIRE PAPERS.THE VAMPIRE PAPERS was a little harder to follow than I, VAMPIRE, as it takes place in the First Person of more than one (ahem) Person, as well as in the third person. It is a simple adjustment, but an adjustment nonetheless.I have obviously missed a book somewhere along the way, as there are holes in the plots between I, VAMPIRE and THE VAMPIRE PAPERS. (Note to self: place amazon.com order after posting review.) I did enjoy this story, especially the VERY well-written lab report. If the plot wasn't so gruesome, I would forward this book along to my mother (who enjoys science but not graphic violence)."
3,"Not too too bad, but REALLY predictable","This is one of the wierdest books I've ever read - it really grabbed my attention quick, but once I found out the plot, it got a little bit ludicrous - yet I couldn't put it down. The characters could definitely have used more fleshing out - the non-vampires, that is. And the story could have gone just as well w/o the graphic detail of the violence. While I read it quickly, I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else."
1,Ridiculous Plot Line,"So the premise of this book is that John Wilkes Booth was turned into a vampire. Somewhere along the way he went nuts and begins to worship neon light as God. This compels him to kill rather indiscriminately and then return to the South to get revenge on the families that had double crossed him when he was mortal. Really..I'm not making this up.We have a clear antagonist but no clear antagonist. David Parker is a very weak character in this book until he turns to the Darkside over the last few pages. It's been quite awhile since I've read I, Vampire but I don't remember him being so worthless.In the end, if a character didn't wind up dead, there was no real closure to their story line.I had to force myself to finish reading it."
4,Michael Romkey creates another winner.,"In the follow up to ""I Vampire"" Michael Romkey keeps to the use of fantasy, history, and what if's that make this book remarkable. Michael Romkey is a brilliant author who uses his books to make a person think about the possibility of certain people becoming vampires. If you enjoy a book that makes you think and enjoy horror with a little gruesome touch than this is a book for yo"
4,Sill Building Toy!,"My 7 and 9 year old sons loved these. It was a little difficult for my 7 year old to build, but with the help of his 9 year old brother they had both of theirs built and happily batteling each other in under 1 hour. My 9 year old has been building everything he can get his hands on from a very young age, but most enjoys the complexity of these type of robots. I think building these type of toys has increased his attention span and building skills immeasurably."
4,Gen 1 to Gen 2+,"Easily makes a gen one NV device into a Gen 2 for relatively little cost. This is a must for Gen 1 NV devices. Only problem is you can't focus it, but it covers the crosshairs so it's not a big deal. You also have to get the weaver base attachment to put it on a picatinny rail. Also the battery goes in backwards."
2,Didn't help,"I don't think it's the product or the producer at fault. Inositol simply wasn't the solution to my personal, individual sleep problem. I still recommend giving it a try because, as we know, everyone is different & using natural products for health problems involves a lot of guesswork because there are so few health practitioners who know anything about them."
4,Ray Dreyfack shares his adventures as an author,"This book is for new freelance writers, or writers who want to leave their boring day job and work into a freelance writing profession. Grab your cup of coffee and sit down in a relaxing chair. Indulge yourself as you hear the ins and outs of the writing business from a pro who spent thirty years behind the typewriter, and now a keyboard. Ray will spin his story that invites you into his world of freelance writing. Some chapters are slow, some material is repeated, but the love of writing freelance shines out clearly. If you freelance, or want to get into the profession this is the `best buy' of new books that shares a successful writer's enthusiasm and joy in the writing trade."
3,If you are a serious writer- you need this book,Even if you are just thinking of getting into the business of writing....go out and get this book today. I work with writers every day and I wish they read this book BEFORE they came to me for publicity. This is THE book on the business of writing- Get it! ...
1,Battery very weak,"The battery on this light doesn't hold a charge very well. After 3 full days of charging in the sun, the light will only work for less than 10 minutes before the unit dies. I also bought a Brookstone light, which is much better than this one."
1,Not too impressed...,"The packaging of this security light is poor. Standard shipping bumps caused an interior box (inside the glossy outer box) to shift. The movement broke off the motion sensor. None of the wires were broken, so, with a bit of Devcon Weldit Cement, it's now back in one piece and working...it was easier to fix it than ship it back to the store for replacement.I recommend that you purchase a different item rather than take a chance mail ordering this one. The manufacturer obviously didn't test the packaging properly. The batteries in these lights are heavy...they need to be secured properly.May 18 update: Well...I should have returned it. A couple of days ago the light stopped working. It makes a nice clicking sound as something in the battery charging system kicks in and drops out, but that's about it. As I said above, buy something else. The manufacturer's quality control is sadly lacking. It's too bad that Amazon's star system doesn't allow changes...even one star is too high."
4,FITS MY NEEDS WITH SECURITY LIGHT,"I tried one for a test run and it works great..........living in florida, we get alot of sun. There was no need to worry about solar energy and i was amazed how bright the lighting was. and for free.i had an electrician install it in the back and i just ordered two more for the sides of the house, which is usually neglected by homeowners.when i walk the dog or just take a stroll around the property at 10 pm, i know the light will come on and i feel safe. a great product and it's charge lasts longer than other solar floods.thanks again"
3,Thought it would be a little different,The plate is standard size and fits the application. Thought the plate would be molded with the pattern or painted. Turns out it is a stick applied to a blank plate
1,Definitely NOT what I expected,"My room is zebra and I thoguht this was perfect! However, when i recieved it in the mail it didn't come in a see through plastic wrap with raffia bow. It came in a letter envelope, that had no padding at all, and was smashed to bits! All it is is contact paper on any old switchplate you buy in a store. I could have made it myself for like 5 bucks and no hassle. I'm in the process of trying to return. Hopefully it works out."
4,Learn about North African music,"A great CD from this North African artist who has been patiently working to share the music and melodies of his native Kabylia with the world. ""Two Borders, One Dream"" should interest world music lovers as well as the novices. More about Idir could be found in the article in the magazine British FROOTS August/Spetember 2003 no. 242/243 written by Ivan Chrysler."
2,disappointing,"When I got this graphic novel in I was excited thinking that Greg Rucka is behind all this, but as I was reading the story I was feeling very disappointed. I found there's too much talking and very little action, Wonder Woman looks ""too sweet"", many smiles and nice words. Not even the art is good to me I think the drawings could have been more detailed and better done, jus as it happen in ""Wonder Woman's - The Hiketeia"", where the artists made an incredible work. I feel upset with this work from Greg Rucka and the artists, and, who had the idea to make the Gods like that? I just can give them 2 stars. Less conversation and mora action, please."
1,Common sense,"Rapaport spends a few hundred pages telling us things that we already know. When somebody is going through a difficult time they will be emotional and will need the support of those who are important to them. This support will take many forms in different circumstances. There. I just saved you the knowledge you'll glean from reading the entire work. Perhaps a specific situation could be discussed with the author and she would be able to provide helpful pointers. However, for a general text it seems to boil down to nothing more than common sense."
5,VERY COLORFUL GREAT MOVIE,"GREAT GIFT , IT WAS FOR CHRISTMAS ,EXCELLENT MOVIE, GREAT PRICES, MY SON WAS VERY HAPPY.RECOMMENDED TO ALL CHILDREN WHO LIKE POKEMON."
1,Great Gift for Nine Year Old Boy,This made a wonderful Christmas gift for my grandson who is really interested in Pokemon. He has watched it over and over.
5,Insightful Poetry,"I really enjoy reading Joseph Fram's poems. He gets to the heart of the matter, whether it be about healing or death or love, and his subtle humor makes me smile again and again. Each poem is an example of well-written contemporary poetry."
1,A Unrealistic game,"This game is crap! First off, the players easly drive down the lane and score a layup. Second I finished a game and I only missed 7 shots, that is not realistic. Well there is not much more I can say exept do not wast your mony on it If you want a nba game that's worth the mony, get nba live 2004."
2,Another faulty game by 989 Sports,"Well, let me start by saying that this game is bad. The gameplay is superficial ( and buggy ), the soundtrack is horrendous, with only 4 or 5 songs, the skill level for this game is for toddlers, etc. The only reason that I'm giving it 2 stars is because the career mode is a little deep, and the summer games are kind of good, but otherwise, it's buggy and bad.If you are looking for a good sports game, don't look for a game made by 989 Sports, look for one from EA Sports, like Madden NFL 2005 or NBA Live 2004."
1,Boring!!!,"This game is horrible.The graphics are bad,the players dont even look like anyone they are suppose to be.The eyes have this weird alien look to them.Their heads are always at an upward angle.The playing part of it isnt that great either.Very easy to beat and win.No talent needed to play.Maybe if i hadnt played ESPN NBA Basketball it wouldnt seem that bad but even so I would have given it a very low rating."
1,Worst Product Ever,This product was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. I feel like a sucker.
1,What is the price of this thing?,I have been searching all over to try and find the price of this Diego toy. I found this add only by using yahoo server inquiry. Amazon search doesnt even show it.My son would love this and I would love to buy it for him if i could ever get amazon to get me a price
3,Son loves him!,"My 4yo son just recieved ""Eggo"" (Deigo) as he calls him for his bday from my mother. He loves this doll! He also recieved the singing Dora doll and it makes a great companion. When you press Deigo's belly, he makes animal sounds and asks you what animal makes that sound. So your child is also learning as well as playing. Oh, And lets not forget about the spanish Deigo speaks, as well as English. Your child will love learning new words in spanish!!!"
5,great gift,my son would love this doll he sings the song all day . i need to get my hands on one of these. please help .
3,Not as detailed as I expected.,"I was rather disappointed with the book. I had expected more details on each river's rapids. I first flipped to the section on Cache Creek, a river I had been on, and found only a couple of rapids mentioned. Nor were there any tips on how to run the couple that were mentioned. Same thing with the section on the Trinity River. I had hoped to find a book that would guide me through each rapid and this book didn't deliver. If I had bought this book in a book store I probably would have returned it but since I bought it online the initial postage coupled with the return postage wasn't worth it. When we buy on the internet there is always a chance that you won't get what you expected and this was a perfect example.I will say that the info that was included in the book was very good and the book was arragned nicely. It does give a fairly good overall view of each river, just not enough detailed info."
1,another sad day in my life....,This is a DVD made with Reel to reel quality. The picture looks horrible. It looks like a game from the stone ages. There is too much technology to produce a product that looks like this and sell it at the price this sells for. I am a true Tarheel fan and can watch just about anything but this is unbearable....
4,classic rap a lot mob shizznit,used to be a big rap a lot fan and yeah 5th ward juvies was tight and a cd worth having in your collection every song on here bangs.
2,G-Groove Makes The Album!!!,"Personally, I purchased this cd mainly because of the track ""G-Groove"" which is a definite classic. Took My Chances and bought the album in hopethat it would all be as good, but was dissapointed. No regrets though because like I said ""G-Groove"" is a classis and a rare track to download anywhere."
4,Better than a Fram but what isn't?,"I chose this filter after I decided to invest several hours of my time researching and watching videos about oil filters. This filter is way better than a Fram if you care about filter build quality and ruggedness. I would buy this filter again, but I would choose a Bosch, Mobil 1, K&N, or Motorcraft filter over this one. My problem was out of those brands, this one was the only brand available for my vehicle and since my research indicated it was a solid filter, I was okay with using it."
1,poor customer service,"Very poor customer service!!! Ordered a Jersey for the Superbowl from ""Fansedge"" thru Amazon on Tuesday (1/29/08). Paid the top level for 1-3 day shipping. Jersey arrived Monday (2/4/08... the day after the Superbowl). Both ""Fansedge"" and Amazon said they had lived up to their obligation. Be very careful in ordering from ""Fansedge"" thru Amazon."
5,Works well,If you work on your Jeep you will eventually need to either remove and replace existing plastic rivets. This tool gets the job done. Plenty of sources for different rivets on the internet.
3,Interesting and still engaging,"This is a great series! It challenges our basic assumptions about freedom and the government. It is written with a sort of, ""Every Teen"" premise. The storyies strongly resemble Columbus, Ohio for a back drop.I have all four books. I don't think they went further."
4,woods,"It is not a scent you run across everyday, it has a bold musk wood smell...but it grows on you. If u want an unique odor that's not too loud but will make a guy turn his head to see whose wearing it, this is your scent."
5,HAD FOR YRS JUST LOVE IT,Nice light soft smell. I've had this perfume for 6years and only use it when I'm going out because I dont want to waste it LOL. I get so many compliments when I do wear it :D
4,Loli,"Very happy with purchase. Every thing was in great conditions. I didn't see any defects on product. Best on all, I got it whithing a week.Thank you."
5,Lolita Lempicka,Perfume was delivered in a timely fashion and exactly as stated. Made a wonderful gift for my daughter over the holidays.
1,You're kidding me!,"This perfume was suggested by a guy friend as I has been looking for a new signature cologne because my usual although I'm in love with (Ralph by RL) seems to be a little too young for me now. I went to a sephora and couldn't find Lolita Lempicka to smell it, so I proceeded to read rave reviews about it and finally ordered it. The scent to my surprise isn't worth the pretty bottle it came in. It's way too sweet, smells cheap and when I tried to gift it at work it was declined; I then gave it to my mom who also said ""this is cheap perfume, I told you to buy anything from Chanel"", and gave LL to my grandmother."
1,"Too ""matronly"" for me","I bought a small sample size of this (thank goodness) without smelling it first because the other reviews made it sound great, but once I put it on, I regretted ever doing so. The smell is fine...it's not awful...but it just smells like grandmothers in general. I did not find it to be anything like the other descriptions. To me, it is like baby powder and lavender. It smells like it should go on a very mature lady or on a little girl to play dress up. It does last for a long time, so if this sounds like the scent for you, then it will linger...even after repeatedly washing your hands. It could just be my body chemistry, though. I love Moonlight Path from Bath and Body Works, but when it's on me, it smells like dirty laundry; so, I do not wear it. Scents that do compliment me are Sensuous from Estee Lauder and anything Juicy...so if that sounds like you, stay clear!"
2,not for everyone....,"After reading all the reviews on this fragrance I cold not wait to try it. Unfortunately I must disagree with most of the reviews. I can only explain this as it must smell different on different people due to body chemistry. On me it smelled old fashioned like something my grandma would wear. It is sweet, and powdery, and not at all spicy. As they day goes on the scent fades into something that reminds me of that old cheap bath powder I got for Christmas as a kid. You know the one in the pink plastic container with the big fluffy powder puff? By days end I could not wait to wash it off. I would definitely test this and not buy based on reviews only. The most positive thing I can say about it is the bottle is very cute!!"
5,Interesting bottle with a more interesting scent,"I purchased this a few years back and the first thought that came to my head was black licorice. Bit that's not all that is in it....and men seem to be attracted to the scent. I highly recommend it, especially for evening wear....LOLITA LEMPICKA perfume, by Lolita Lempicka, was introduced in 1997. This fine fragrance contains ivy, anise, violet and is accented with licorice, vetiver, and vanilla, making LOLITA LEMPICKA perfume perfect for evening use."
2,Smells like spray starch,"I don't know if I got an old one or what, but this perfume smells like spray starch. Or like a cross between spray starch and those old, unscented hairsprays (like ""Aqua Fresh""...do they even still sell those??).Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.I ordered the ""L"" by Lolita at the same time and it smells great! Nothing at all like this other (and reviewers said they were close sisters), so maybe I did get a bad bottle.Update: After 2 hours of smelling like spray starch, I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth. THEN it still smelled, but it smelled good! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described. Still smelled strong, just no spray starch. And it smelled almost identical to the way the ""L by Lolita"" smells right out of the bottle."
1,Where is my Product,"I want to know where is my product, because i can't find the tracking, and i had not received. Please check and write me."
5,I love this scent,Its a sexy good smelling scent. I enjoy it alot and I use it everyday. Everyone says what is that smelll it smells so good I tell them Lolita.
1,sickening,"I only have a sample of this but would suggest someone obtain a sample before spending money on any perfume. This is one of the worst smelling creations, like bad chocolate and a clay i use to play with as a child. Awful, cloying, over-powering, simply horrible. i'm throwing this sample out."
3,"Lovely scent, doesn't last","This perfume is one of my favorite scents and I would always stop by Sephora to get a quick spritz. I finally convinced myself to purchase the scent on Amazon. However, I cannot get the scent to last much longer than a few hours unless I spray myself with at least 6 pumps. I've only just gotten the perfume but have already used a good amount just to make the scent last through the day."
1,Why Does Everyone Like This?????,"Ok. Normally I would never, ever buy a scent I haven't had the chance to smell myself and I almost always use my favorite go-to perfume, Victoria's Secret Dream Angel...Heavenly - but I was looking for a change and took a risk. I thought of course this would be an amazing scent with all of the glowing reviews....ewwww I was totally wrong.Packaging and Shipping....great as always. But once I opened the box and sprayed a small amount on my wrist I was instantly disappointed. This smells a lot like an Avon perfume that my Grandma would wear. Strong, over-powering and I had headache that wouldn't go away. Here's the thing...my husband kind of likes it which is strange because he usually has great taste. Either way...this stuff is going back in the box and being regifted to maybe coworker I don't necessarily like and that sits far, far, far away from my office!!"
1,YUCK!!!!,"I did not like this perfume, smelled awful...almost like bug spray. It did not remind me of the woods, unless you are thinking of bugs. It had no particular note that stuck out just an awful smell."
1,is it really made in 2005???,I haven't ordered it yet because it says the product is made in 2005... is it true??? I would like to get a recent one...
2,Easier Said than Done,"Yes, it's easy to read and the forms look great. In practice, I've found that the flow and logic needs to be more tailored to the client. In some stages the flow seemed awkward, and didn't necessarily work. When you get that ""confused look"" from your client, and feel it yourself, you'll understand what I mean. I have an MSOD and have practiced 10 years. My sense is that my experience is not totally unique and I could see a revised version in the making."
3,For arcade nostalgia buffs only!,"I bought this game because I fondly remember playing games like Rygar and Bomb Jack at the arcade or at the pizza parlor when I was a kid, not because any of the games on here are particularly high-quality. In fact, Tecmo's best and most well-known arcade title, Ninja Gaiden, isn't even included in this collection (they saved it to include as an extra in Ninja Gaiden Black for the Xbox). As is the case with Tecmo Bowl, many gamers don't know that the wildly popular NES version of Ninja Gaiden had its roots in an arcade title (known for its gory continue screen more than anything else). If, like me, you're a sucker for classic arcade compilations and enjoy a trip down memory lane, I'd recommend picking this up on the cheap (I got it on eBay for less than $10, brand new, including shipping). If you want to play the Tecmo Bowl you remember from your childhood, download it on the Wii Virtual Console for $5.00."
1,Wouldn't waste your time or money,"I bought the combo kit with 2 originals and 1 junior. I also got the square one. I should have listened to the other reviewers and stuck with just the originals. First of all, when I the product got delivered, I only received the junior station, I knew it wasn't a good start. Secondly, the junior sprinkler had a crack at the base of the sprinkler like it was tightened too much during assembly. luckily, I connected it to a hose to check it's spray distance before installing the thing in the ground. Thirdly, the spray distance is not as advertised, I had my hose connected to this single device and it barely reached 9 ft, it was turned to max water pressure on the sprinkler. The mist was so fine that the wind was blowing the water away, and it wasn't even that windy out at the time. BTW, the square one doesn't work that well either."
3,Super-Small,"Good sound. Very small, but sturdy. It's hard to make the different sounds because it is so small. It's not a good learning drum, but decorative and could be good as a travel drum for someone more experienced and refined in their technique."
2,Boredom Then Stupid,For long hours you have to read to why the authors have great ideas about a new city. The authors explain their new city through different characters. None of which you care about. But they explain it a lot. Their city is threatened. Then in the very last few minute they save that city. The problem is by the time you get to the end you don't care. It's all freakin' boring.
3,"Disappointing, considering how good Niven and Pournelle are","I expected an SF book when I picked this up at a used bookstore while on vacation. It actually had no SF in it at all. This disappointed me. The plot was a little dry, and the characters weren't that compelling.I was disappointed, because I generally like Niven, and his other books with Pournelle that I've read have been quite good.The story is about a huge city-in-a-building which sits inside of Los Angeles, and mainly deals with conflicts between the citizens of LA and those of Todos Santos (loosely inspired by Arcosanti, I believe, which is also mentioned in the book). It's psychologically interesting, but not much beyond that, unfortunately.I'm being generous with 3 stars, because it was well written, even if it wasn't that good a story."
2,Tedious without any real SF in it.,"I didn't see much of what I like about Niven in this book. Mostly full of character development, no SF and the plot seems silly and slow."
2,Warning- This is a Re-print!,"This is a reprint of a book written in 1981. Shame on Amazon for not noting that fact!I won;t go into the plot, except it's hard to take seriously because all of the ""cutting edge"" technology used is dated."
3,Good Book,"I found this book to be an easy read with a lot of entertainment value. The author made me smile and, at times, laugh out loud. Well worth the bucks."
4,I enjoyed the book!,"I enjoyed the book! Lana and the others did a great job of capturing what it means to be single today. They did not gloss over their frustrations, but stated them and shared what they had learned from them. Reading their thoughts helps other singles realize they are not alone in how they feel."
3,Rules and Policy,"A fine book, and a nice addition to the growing necessity for managing employee activity and office automation. It should be said that a more comprehensive treatment can be found in ""I.T. Wars: Managing the Business-Technology Weave in the New Millennium."""
2,Not up to her usual standard,"Was greatly dissappointed in this series (Hello Gorgeous & Drop Dead Gorgeous), not anything close to the quality and standard of the ""Betsy the Vampire Queen Series"". Expected a lot more."
2,"Um, the cover is misleading! 2 1/2 stars","The idea behind the story was really interesting. But the presentation of the plot fell flat. Everything was just jumbled into one big mess of HUH??? And the castle? Actually, I'm still confused. And the hair colour changing thing? Not cute.Most of all, I was suckered into the book by the mention of Manolos. As a shoe freak, I enjoy reading about fellow shoe freaks. The heroine does not even talk about shoes! Hell, as a cyborg-whatever-she-was I am sure she doesn't even need shoes.I wish this story could be done over with better plot and character development."
5,struck me funny!,"What would you do if you are out for a good time with friends, and then wake up some time later, and you are that lady from the bionic woman? This is cool premise and it struck me as just so funny. She is just like Lindsay Wagner ( I think her name was - only saw them in reruns). Sometimes it was silly, but it still had me laughing. And a good laugh is always worth the ticket. 4 stars for originality, 1 one star for fun.Not sure how it will hold up as a series, but willing to go another book or two to see."
4,Isn't she the Vampire Queen?,"Oh yeah, that's the ""Undead"" series. This was just like one of the ""Undead"" books, only not as funny. The main characters were almost carbon copies from the other series.Still a fun read, but I'm glad I checked it out from the library."
1,Just AWFUL. Don't Waste Your Money!!,"Hello, Gorgeous! is a huge disappointment for this MaryJanice Davidson fan. Don't Waste a Dime on this book!The basic plot & character elements are there, and this should have been a fun, refreshing twist in the chick lit genre. But it reads like a first very preliminary draft that never was fleshed out into a more solid plot. The characters are weak and annoying.If I read the word ""yummy"" one more time I was going to throw this book across the room!This is like a very weak cup of a delicious gourmet coffee. You KNOW how good it *should be*, but it's not. It's unsatisfying and you expect alot more and are totally disappointed."
1,This Book,"If you started reading MaryJanice Davidson's books by reading this one first you might think she's the dullest author this side of anywhere. But it's just this book that's stupid, dumb, dull, boring with sex thrown in to get a publisher to think the story is worthwhile. Most of the other books have better plots and are more fun. If you need to read everything she ever wrote(and I'm finding out there are a lot of those)get this from the library instead of buying it. Trust me on this, once is enough."
5,good value shoes,"comfortable, nicely-designed. plus, i bought one pair from Amazon.com at the cost of less than $50. What a good value! Therefore the shoes deserve definitely a 5-star rating."
3,Not very durable.,"We purchased two of these covers for our downstairs changing table so that when one is soiled we can put the other on while the soiled one is being laundered. We've been using them for only 5 weeks now, and they're both showing signs of wear. They're frayed and snagged. They do the job, but they don't look very nice. When I bought a set for our upstairs changing table, I decided to purchase a different brand. Hopefully they'll hold up better."
2,Not the best quality...there has to be something better!,"I bought two of these covers for my simmons contoured changing pad. They are not very soft and look like a cheap towel. Aside from the shrinking, both my green and blue cover have faded...even with dreft only washings! After five months of use I am now trying to find a better cover that will be softer, look better & hold up to washings!"
4,Serves its purpose...,ANY ITEM that is 100% cotton WILL SHRINK in the dryer. That's the reality of dealing with cotton. It's a fabulous fabric but IT SHRINKS. If you hang up to dry or dry on a low setting that'll help minimize shrinkage. This is a great product and it serves its purpose very well.
4,It's a good product... BUT,I love it! I've been using it for a year and I haven't had any problems... It does shrink if your not careful... just keep the drier on a low to med setting and it will be just fine!
1,Poor Quality!!!,I washed the cover for the first time and it didn't hold up. The ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band attaches to the terry. Also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else I washed with it. I'm extremely disappointed with this product.
5,No problems!,"I was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews, but I did it anyway, and I'm glad. The covers are durable--the color hasn't faded, and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad. I think they're soft enough for diaper changing--I wouldn't put my baby to sleep on it, but then, who would?"
1,Does not wear well!,"I agree with the others-the cover shrinks and is too small. As a result, it made the changing pad corners all bent. I just bought a new changing pad to replace the other one and bought different covers that won't look like the dog chewed on them after being washed."
1,2babies,"I agree with the others-the cover shrinks and is too small. As a result, it made the changing pad corners all bent. I just bought a new changing pad to replace the other one and bought different covers that won't look like the dog chewed on them after being washed."
2,"useful item, but very poor quality","We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both. The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package. After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse. It has strings hanging all over it. It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible! A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality)."
2,not the best...,"We purchased these covers for our son's changing table and I must say I am very disappointed. Aside from the fact that they shrank (and I do know how to do laundry, for those that say ""you just have to be careful when you wash them"") they all got snags and lines in the fabric after just one laundering. We ended up getting the ""especially for baby"" covers along with a quilted cover offered in the store, though not online, and couldn't be happier. I wouldn't waste my money on these, you will just have to purchase different ones in a short while."
2,Doesn't hold up well!,"I bought this cover in Sage green. It snagged and unravelled the first time I washed it! Over the past 6 months, the color has faded to a dingy green/gray color and it is scratchy! For as many times as these covers are used and washed, spend a little extra money and buy the chamois covers from Pottery Barn Kids!"
1,fabric snags badly,"When I took it out of the bag, there were so many snags in the fabric that it looked like it had been used already (it hadn't!) Very poor construction and cheaply made. Fot $13 I expected it to be better...we will return this asap"
2,Snags easy!,"I don't recommend the terry because when I put the baby down on the pad with my hand underneath his head, my ring tends to snag the terry fabric. I now put another changing pad over it to avoid any further snagging."
1,Not worth the money!!,"I agree with the others-the cover shrinks and is too small. As a result, it made the changing pad corners all bent. I just bought a new changing pad to replace the other one and bought different covers that won't look like the dog chewed on them after being washed."
5,Outstanding illustrations -wonderful story,The first thing that grabs you about this book is the fabulous illustrations and how they captures the effect of the moonlight for example as seen through the water and the bat's wings. It is so easy to relate to this story as you see the things people do at the beach being done by bats but in the way bats behave. A great way to learn about bats and enjoy the cross over familiarity to our world; delights and makes you laugh. Wonderful read and great eye candy! I bought many to give to each of the little one's in my family and to my friend's kids.
5,Amazing book--A True Gem,"This book is great. I even enjoyed it. The story is written in verse so it is easier to read aloud--at least for me. The artwork is stunning and so cute. The way Lies personifies the bats while simply substituting some small details such as the ""salted skeeters"", ""moon-tan lotion"", and ""sand caves"" is so fun. This book is on par with classics such as Snow and The Very Hungry Caterpillar."
5,A fun book for grade school kids,"On a recent trip to visit my nephew (who is in the second grade) he read this book to me each night, it was so cute with good illistrations I bougth a copy for my grand children when I got home. They enjoy it to."
1,Disappointed!,"I looked forward to this book after reading the reviews. What a disappointment!...absolutely fluff with no particular cute story line, nothing to recommend it. Save your money kids."
4,Different Mixes?,"A number of these songs sound different than the mixes on ""The John Lennon Collection""(which is out of print, newer compilations with these songs have been released, I don't know how they compare). While there is no info with the CD, it sounds like they have been remixed. The keyboard hits a wrong chord that really sticks out on ""Instant Karma"", (at 1:42). You can sort of hear it on the older version, but they covered it up. The vocal is also very distorted. Some elements of the new mixes seem better, revealing more clarity. Some elements of the old mixes seem better. Of the two ""unreleased"" songs, the instrumental ""How Do You Sleep?"" actually sounds pretty cool, with George Harrison's edgy slide guitar work. The ""Attica State"" recording is historically important, although there are several bursts of feedback from the sound system during the song. I would say this collection is mainly for Lennon completists, or those who would like a sample of his post-Beatles political songs."
4,good single disk retrospective,"dock it one star for Yoko Ono's summing up over the intro to ""Oh My Love"". Nice intro, but you won't hear it here. Everything else is unharmed. One new live track, ""Attica State"" (a very silly lyric), and one new remastered Beatles track."
1,Lame Lame Lame,"We bought this game for our 5-year old son and it's first of all way too difficult for him. But that was our fault. However, after basically playing the whole game for him, we finally get to the end only to find out that there were apparently hidden challenges, or ""munkeys"" in this case that we failed to catch, to be exact, 11 of them!! 11?? How could we have missed that many challenges??? Why did the game let us get all the way to the end just to send us back to do it all over again?? This is very poor design and for a children's game, the makers should be tarred and feathered, not to mention ashamed, for setting it up that way. A big thumbs down for this incredibly lame and unsatisfying game. All our efforts were for naught."
5,Haters can have anvils dropped on their heads!,"Back when I didn't have a Gamecube, I went to my friend Tom's house and played this game. I guess it's not a bad game after all..oh well.P.S. If you hate the game, movie, or both, I think you better take a look at this review's title, I say this game is aGet-it-or-suck."
1,STupID All the Way,"This game was the most stupid game i have ever not played. I thought the movie was bad enough. Please, they dont need to entertain me with this boring game.Don't ever buy it, it is a waist of your precious money."
1,A pathetic piece of S@#%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!! It might be fun for a 5 year old, but I beat it in 2 HOURS!!!!!!!!! Then you have to dress up in stupid cstumes to get powers. PATHETIC!!!!! I don't know why my mom got it for me for Christmas, but I got 5 bucks for it at Game Crazy!!!!! DON'T BOTHER BUYING OR RENTING THIS OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would have given this thing 0 stars if I was able to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not the right picture!,"I have the covered vegetable bowl AND the round vegetable bowl. The item pictured is the ROUND vegetable bowl, and should be much much less than the cost shown here. So, either you will be paying way over what you should if you get what is pictured, or you won't be getting what is pictured. This needs to be fixed."
5,Evolver is an excellent cd!,"When ""From Chaos"" came out, I really didnt like where 311 was going. I thought the cd was a good cd, many great quality tracks, but I thought it wouldnt hold up against thier earlier work.Dont worry fellow 311ers, take all of thier previous cds and mush them all together into one super cd and you get Evolver. The recording is steller as always with Ron Saint Germain. It has its beautiful parts and its heavy parts. The only real problems i have with it is that it has only 11 tracks. No big woop though."
3,EVOLVED? INTO WHAT?,"dON'T GET ME WRONG! 311 is the greatest band that I, personally have ever heard. Every cd that they have ever put out, has blown me away. From Chaos was a great return to their grassroots birth. Cd after cd has been great for more than a decade.But!! I really don't like this cd much at all. I still love 311 and have been waiting for them to put out one bad cd like every band does. Well, friends.... this one is it. There are about 3 good songs on the cd. Quite honestly, the rest is really bad. Lack of 311 origianlity, rythym, and melodies make them sound like a new band.That's ok with me. They have earned the right to experiment, and that's exactly what they did. If your a 311 fan, you may want to sit this one out!!I'm sure the next one will be better!!"
5,311 gets better with age!,"This CD has got to be one of their best yet. I love ""creatures for a while"", and ""beyond the gray skies"" has to be my favorite song on the CD. Their style has ""evolved"" and the name of the record proves it. It brings some of their older sounds and new sounds together in a great compilation."
2,album is great,Love the album. Music is flat out amazing. These guys suprise me every time. I am used to a harder and faster 311 but that is why they concerts.
4,311's still flowing on Evolver,"Honestly, as a music buff, I didn't expect much out of 311's latest release, Evolver. The band's been making music for over ten years, and this, their seventh studio album, was bound to lose a little gusto. I mean, really, not many groups can keep making music with as much adrenaline and passion as they did 10 years ago, they usually just run out of steam. However, as Nick Hexum croons in Creatures, the group's first single off the new album, ""I'd surely like to rest, but the energy gets the best of me."" This album comes roaring out of the gates with some hi-fi, guitar-drenched, pure rock songs. The band shows their trademark colors when they add little upgrades to their music such as DJ cuts and voice mods. They're then able to vacilate to some relaxing, melodic ballads with ease. All these improvements to their rock songs help the band to keep evolving, now and hopefully for another ten years."
3,Good....But Not The Same Old 311,All in all 311 is a great band. It just seems ever since Soundsystem the sound of their band has changed. It is more mellow with less rap intertwined. Evolver is a decent album with the best song being Creatures. If you are a hardcore 311 fan I'm sure you will enjoy this album in some way. But if this is your first 311 album the older stuff like their album Music is waaaay better. I highly recommend all of their albums.
5,311 returns to it's Grassroots,"311 is back!! Not just some of the band members but 311 as a jamming band once again!This is an awsome group effort starting with the instant hit ""Creatures"", flowing into ""Reconsider Everything"". Every song on this album flows with such a smooth groove, even the slower songs (only two) put you right in the middle of great music.This album reflects the originality that made 311 a step ahead of everyone else. With lyrics going back and forth from Nick to S.A with P-nut slapping the bass like it's the last time he is every going to smack them strings, and Tim coming up with some crunchy rifs.If you haven't seen 311 live, check them out. They put an awsome show on, and there are many songs on this album that will have you jumping all over the place like a damn frog.If you've been under a rock for 10 years get out there and experience some 311."
5,311 is better than ever!,"311 is my all time favorite band. I've been waiting for Evolver to come out for what seems like such a long time. I went out and bought it the day it came out. It hasn't left my cd player since. This album is amazing. Honestly it is so much better than what I expected it to be. 311 has never let their fans down and they probably never will. I love every song on Evolver. Though the major highlights for me are ""Creatures(For A While)"", ""Beyond the Gray Sky"", and ""Sometimes Jacks Rule The Realm"". In my opinion, this is the best 311 album to come out. Go out and buy Evolver."
2,Just OK,"I love 311 and I support the guys in everything they do, but I just feel like they've just reached a point in there career where everything they put out is just O.K.There are a few really good songs on this album (Creatures, Reconsider Everything), but most of it is just average at best. 311's music used to have a real edge and creativity to it that has been missing since Transistor. I've seen some bands go through this when they get older and start to mellow out.Unfortunately, they will never top Grassroots, the crowning achievement of their career. The new stuff just doesn't have the same magic and energy that their earlier albums do. So, this album is just OK, it doesn't blow me away like Music, Grassroots, Blue (yes, even though it's popular it's good), and Transistor did."
3,Only as good as it should be,"In some instances, I enjoy 311 for the music they make. It's not mind-numbingly horrible, yet on the other hand it's not earth-shakingly good. For as long as I can remember, 311 has been a constant source of average funk-metal-rap music, and they've always delivered. This album is no different in that it's not good, yet not bad either. It's comfortable just where it is, somewhere between crap and spectacular. Try tracks 9 and 10."
5,311 IS THE BEST!,"I have all of 311's music! Evolver continues the perfection of311! Creatures (For a While) was a great choice as the debuttrack of this album! I love the song Give Me a Call, it isdefinitely my favorite of all 11 tracks! But once again, as withall 311 albums, there are no bad tracks on Evolver! Every songhas a great beat! 311 continues to rock the music world, andEvolver proves it!"
5,The Evolution of Evolver,"311 has been producing a unique sound of music for many years. Their newest album ""Evolver"" is a mix of rock, funk, reggae, and everything in between. It is very different from their previous albums, but also similar in many ways. There is an equal combination of hard beats, followed by melodic tunes. When listening to each song, you can feel the emotion that is expressed through their lyrics. I have yet to decide my favorite song on the album, but Evolver is more than anything I could have wished for. Can't nobody do it like 311!"
4,A little different 311,"the band 311 has changed a little with the release of this album, but not for the worse. What use is a good band if all the albums remain the same. These guys are creative and they want to branch out. I give them great respect for that, because they can do it, and do it well. This is not their best album; what could top transistor? but i love it for what it is. Alot, i mean alot, more focus is on the music, which on these 11 songs is complex, and somewhat more complex then anything they've previously done. Every song is not superb though. A few songs are not superb, but still remain pretty good. ""Beyond the grey sky"" is one of their best songs on any album period; that would be hard to dispute. And there is even some acoustic songs, and yes, still a few raps that still haven't changed over the years. The album has lost its spacy feel compared to past releases, but it is still a very focused release."
4,311 Evolved,"The editor's review above makes it obvious that he isn't a 311 fan. ""Soundsystem"" is a great piece of work that successfully mixes various styles of music that come together to form a very original sound. As for ""Evolver"", ""Creatures"" is definitely a 311 song, loud, with harmonious vocals and a distinctive drum sound. Listening to the rest of the album is not a letdown but the sound has changed somewhat. The changes are subtle; it's as if you can tell that the members of 311 are growing up and they know their audience is too. This is a must buy if you have ever been a 311 fan."
4,always evolving,"Ive been a diehard 311 fan for as long as i can remember , and evolver shows another side of them. That they can MAKE REAL MUSIC. (not saying that the always didnt) but with this cd they have songs witch prove they they are getting better and better. Songs like jacks rule, and seems uncertain show there more musical side to them. this cd reminds me of a mix of soundsytem and and transistor which are to great cds. And CREATURES could be the best song on this album. It is genious. And -other side of things also is one of the best songs on the album. The chorus is great. Evolver gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it is missing some of my favorite parts of 311. The slow raggae songs like on grassroots. But i would hav to say they didnt miss that with beyond the gray sky. it is a great song. Evolver is a great new album. Any one who is fans of transistor and soundsystem would love evolver..........AUGUST SHOW---GONNA BE SICK"
4,311 has evolved,"Evolution is not aobut getting rid of the old stuff, but instead should be about adding new stuff, making something more complete. I think that 311 has continued on this path with their latest album. ""Evolver"" includes songs written and performed with emotion of all kinds, whether it be the emotional, ""Beyond The Gray Sky,"" or the adrenalin pumping ""Creatures for a while,"" that should cause just about anyone to start nodding their head and slapping the steering wheel. 311 continues to write music that speaks to them, and that in turn speaks to their listeners."
5,This is good,"311's style has came through a transformation since their debut album ""Music"". I would have to say this is more of a laidback type of album then the others. It's a mix of ""Transistor"" and ""From Chaos"" It's worth the buy, whether or not your a fan of 311."
4,this is good stuff.,"I wasn't into 311 until i heard Creatures. That's because the radio has mangled their impression on me by either not playing them (usually) or playing only their few big hits. However, they are a great band, excellent songwriting team, good performers, and an interesting sound. I have more of their albums now. Yes, it has been done before, but never quite like this. These guys sound like sublime, old incubus, and old Red hot chili peppers, but with their own unique style and deliverance. They mix a bunch of genres, and one could say they borrowed a few ideas. This album focuses less on rap, and more on the experimentation of new sounds in their music, especially on the guitar. The name fits. The best songs lyrically are Still dREAMING, cRACK THE cODE, and Other Side of Things. The two singers work together and ""trade lines"" in a way that makes it sound like improv, but very tight. The bass is great (as usual) and This album is a winner. Rock and roll at it's finest."
5,Nebraska's finest!,"Evolver is an album you put on to mellow with or jump around to. This album rocks. It's probably 311's most articulate album to date. It's not lavish or gaudy, like you find with many rap/rockers out there. 311 created/defined the hybrid genre and therefore can rock mellower and harder than the rest."
5,Evolver takes 311 in a new direction.,"Evolver is 311's seventh studio album. I think that the album is excellent. They have truly evolved as a band. The album is much more mellow than previous albums, but I think that is what makes it more enticing. There are songs that display deep emotional lyrics such as ""Beyond the Gray Sky."" Which talks about depression and coping with the stresses of today's world. Another great song is ""Seems Uncertain."" Which seems to be an excellent song about the war and whats going on in the world today. Hexum and Martinez lyrics are always deep and profound and give listeners a personal sense of well-being. Coupled with P-Nut's groovy bass lines on songs like ""Other Side of Things"" and Tim's awesome guitar riffs make for a great album. Of course Sexton's great talent as a drummer is present on songs such as ""Crack the Code."" All in all I think this album is a definite must have especially for any 311 fan."
5,Good All the Way Around,"311's new cd consists of songs that you would think would be on either Transistor, Grassroots, and 311. They go back to their roots and also proceed to push forward with more mellow/deep moving songs (ie. Sometimes Jacks Rule the Realm). This cd is for anyone who is a fan of 311, a fan of dancehall/reggae. If u listen to bands such as zebrahead, alien ant farm, linkin park, sublime, u'll enjoy this cd to the fullest. I personally think this album is their best work they've put out since Transistor. So enjoy, and buy 311's new cd Evolver"
4,Album made for live performances,"Being a 311 fan for over 11 years now, I have heard just about every recording they have ever made. With that said, I would like to note that on first listening to this cd, I was not completeley amazed or blown away by it. The whole album was worth listening to and enjoyable, but not any better than the rest of the catalog. But I have to make a point that all of the songs on this cd are AMAZING concert material. They simply sound perfect live and in person. ""Beyond the gray sky"" was a live performance that was not easily forgettable."
4,Fairly Deep for Beach Rock...,"I really liked Creatures (For a While), so I went and checked the prices in my local music store, and for a scant 10 bucks, I picked it up. Usually 10 bucks is my limit on buying a CD for one song, but I'm really glad that I picked this album up.I expected all of the songs to be sort of meaningless guitar riffs chewing up a track with the dualing vocals I had heard on ""Creatures"", but I was surprised. It wasn't. I was dissapointed. Then I got through the cd a few times and I realised that I actually realy liked the cd. ""Reconsider Everything"" ""Crack the Code"" and others really make this cd what it is, since they are not just pointless rock songs, they're songs with a little feeling behind them, a little wisdom that seems beyond their years.So yeah, this album is worthy a purchase, but I hope I didn't make it sound like this is a life changing album, it's not. It's just solid rock with some strong vocals."
3,Ron Saint Germain not a savior,"After the lack luster ""From Chaos,"" I was hoping 311 wouldn't select Ron Saint Germain to produce thier newest album ""Evolver,"" but I was wrong. The CD starts of very strong with ""Creatures (For a While)"" and ""Reconsider Everything,"" but then takes a wicked turn with one of the worst tracks 311 has ever put on an album ""Same Mistake Twice."" I love 311 and have for 13 years, but I wish they would stick to the style that gave them so many loyal fans. I long for the days of ""Music"" and ""Grassroots."" 311's ""Evolver"" could have been much better."
5,Evolver is 311's evolution at its height,"311 has been on the road pumping out material for well over a decade and with every new CD they have evolved and defined themselves. Evolver takes the band to a new level, as it's a bit more subdued compared to earlier albums like Grassroots but keeps the same high energy feel. The CD is a milestone in the band's progression as they experiment with more accoustic guitar and a more melodic mix of rap than their earlier days, with their characteristic positive lyrics that reflect their attitudes. Evolver has allready become one of my favorite CDs to come from 311. Its completely original and teems with tangible energy. (By the way, P-nut has really out done himself - great bass in these songs especially ""Don't Dwell"")"
5,Thinking again.,"First off, its awesome just to even have new 311. I picked up the CD on the release date and at first I didn't really enjoy it, I thought there were to many mellow songs. BUT after a weeks or so worth of listening there really aren't that many mellow songs, I think 2 maybe 3. Every song has its unique pieces, for instance the chorus in ""still dreaming"" is so flowing and perfectly in tempo that I just want to listen over and over. I am a little disappointed that there are no Tim solo's he can really play (check out track 7 on grass roots). All in all its a great new cd. 311 definitely does not get the recognition they deserve. They have been around the block and then some and as far as I'm concerned have had a sound that has been ahead of their time (listen to the cd ""music"" its pretty heavy like the rock rap, but look how old it is they were doing it before the Korns and Limp Bizkits). Thats my .02 worth"
3,Not really evolving...,"311 have always been the underdogs of modern-rock. They've always been around and helped pave the way for countless bands by successfully blending funk, metal, rap and pop. True pioneers, but this and their past release 'From Chaos' are truly flawed. The band seems to be stuck in a rut. Running out of ideas, 'Evolver' is merely a re-hash of previously visited ideas. 'Creatures (For A While)' serves as a nice, pumping first single and kicks the album off with a powerful kick and 'Seems Uncertain' is a cool, laid-back track sporting acoustic guitars that gives this album some flavor. However, the bulk of this album is just tired. True, the songs are not bad in any way, ('Crack The Code' and 'Still Dreaming' are two tracks worth mentioning) but it's just all the same stuff we've heard before. This is 311's seventh album, you would think they could revamp or create something special. Maybe next album, but not this one."
2,hey it's that band with those one song(s) again,"this band really gets some major legwork out of one melody...they've been around since i was in highschool, inspired millions of untalented whiteboy funkschlockin' minions, yet still haven't bothered to write a different song...oh well, all the more power to them..."
4,pretty fantastic effort from 311,"after hearing the single (creatures) a month ago, it was obvious that the title of this album wasn't bs. this isn't just more of the same, its not normal 311 fare. they really have evolved into something more substantial with this record. track 5 (beyond the gray sky) is worth the [money] alone. other standouts are Creatures, Give Me A Call, Seems Uncertain, and Crack The Code. overall, a highly enjoyable CD... would have gotten 5 stars if it was a bit longer, clocking in at just under 42 minutes."
5,Best 311 Album!,I've been listening to 311 since the early 90's and I can honestly say that EVOLVER is their BEST ALBUM!! I can't stop listening to it. Its so addictive!
2,The worst 311 cd to date,"This cd has about 2/3 good songs total. not for any major, real 311 fan, it gets old really fast and the vocals range from amazing to downright ..... Sorry, Nick and SA, this cd wasn't meant to be this bad. Check out still dreaming and Creatures (for a while) however, those are the real standout songs on the record. I hope others agree with this review of this disappointing cd 2 years in the making."
5,evolver,"Long awaited and well worth it's wieght in gold (and more)..If you are looking for a spiritual awakening, this album will get you closer. This album has everything you could ask for, from hard beats to soft melodies. Hexum and Martinez lyrical genuises. Songs like Creatures, Don't dwell, Crack the code will enlighten your being from its inner core. On a scale of one to ten, I give Evolvor.. 11 .."
5,311 ROCKS!!!,"This album is INCREDIBLE. The punk guitar riffs, the funk bass lines, dancehall beats, the hard drum line and the genuine vocals! This album goes above and beyond any true 311 fan could expect, and if you are not a fan, it will convert you. They are a genre of their own, no other band compares to 311. 311 is the most original, fan-focused band in the whole world! They are all about the music and the fans. If you have never seen them live, you are not getting the full 311 experience. Buy this album NOW and listen to it over and over. It just gets better and better every time."
4,Ver Melloe but still AWESOME!!,"In my opinion different from any other 311 album it takes some getting used too but in the end you will love it ""Dont Dwell"" is awesome!! so is CRACK THE CODE!"
3,311 is a great band but...,i have been a 311 fan since the self titled album and feel that Evolver sounds similar to to soundsystem and transistor. i am not saying thats bad but i would like to see some more songs like they did on 311 and grassroots.
4,311 still rules the realm,"this is a good album. my favorie songs are ""creatures (for a while)"", ""beyond the grey sky"", and ""other side of things"". i have been listening to 311 for many years now, and id probably compare this album with soundsystem and from chaos. i know that its obvious because they went in a different direction after transistor and have stuck to it. this album is definatley more matured than any of their others. they dont use any coarse language, and their songs are more melodic than ever. there's still the reggae/rock/hiphop effect that has defined 311. this is especially evident in ""crack the code"".this is a great album and i would recommend getting it plus it has a great interactive part of it in the enhanced cd portion."
5,Great Album,"311 has taken the next step in music making. i loved their early stuff, and i liked the direction they took with From Chaos, and now with Evolver, they have continued in a positive direction. This album is flowing, musically. a great buy for any 311 fan. it is a chill album all the way, but while you are chilling, you are rocking out to some great songs."
5,the newest 311 cd,"A mixture of old style with new techniques has brought Evolver to a great standing with all their fans, new and old... With such works as ""Crack the Code"" and ""Beyond the Gray Sky"", this cd has attracted a lot of positive attention. A brilliant album of 311's and great for any listener!"
5,P-NUT! BEAT THAT THAAANG!!!!,"This is a f*cking great album. 311 has really taken a step in a new direction and i like it. However, I do miss the reggae :( This is not as good a blazing album as lets say Grassroots, but no matter...even without it this album still has a funky 311 vibe that I really like. Whip out the graffix bong and sing-a-long! Buy this album you heeb!<////miT=#1////>~~~(, o)====:::"
4,Yet another great album,"I'm a huge 311 fan, from way back in the day, and I own all their albums. I think this is a great album, although I still like the first four the best. To me, the most recent three albums have been slightly more easily digestible, meaning that it's easy to like the tracks on the first or second listen. Unfortunately, that also means they seem to get old faster. Don't get me wrong, this is 311 and it rocks! This album will stay in your cd player for a while. You'll enjoy how 311 does some slower songs and succeeds in making them great. My biggest criticism is that it's kind of short. 11 tracks isn't a whole heck of a lot, and 311 always has studio outtakes that they don't feel are good enough for the album or some sh*t. I think by know they should know that their characteristically loyal fans are thirsty for everything they can get, and I can say some of the past outtakes are among my favorite 311 tracks of all time. Anyway, get this album, you'll love it."
2,yawnsville,"This album is weak! They have gone from great to good to so-soto [not good]. I have been a 311 fan since the begining and I have always and will always say Nick Hexum can't write a lyric ... and he proves that more and more every album. I was hoping that 311 would follow some of theirmore succesful songs (all mixed up, Amber etc.) which are reggae, and run a whole album like that. But instead they come up with some tired modern rock schtick that any tired Korn fan would appreciate. Note to 311: make an album with all reggae and dubthat is what you are and have always perfected."
2,Same ol' same ol',"A fanstatic production with a rich, full sound all with the same old tired 311 formula that has been going on since their self titled release. 'Soundsystem' had some absolute magic moments but it seems like the boys feel that the four variations of 311 will cut it for the next decade.This being 1. The slow 'chilled' reggae tune. 2. The frantic riff heavy song with the sung catchy harminised chorus and rapped verses. 3. The slow 'moody' ballard tune and 4. More riffs and silly high pitched school boy rap.Don't get me completely wrong, 311 have written some gold over their 13 year or so career but the last two albums have left me feelin' like ""you've got one, you've got them, all"".It's funny how 'Grassroots', released ten years ago and one of their earliest albums sounds more mature, original and fresh than anything they have released since. 'Evolver' is quite an ironic title because I thought as you get older you become wiser, re-invent and well.......EVOLVE!"
5,Convenient primer on the primate,"Though not wishing to compromise my Reformed Baptist convictions, I didn't want to be ignorant about the new pope Benedict XVI (sixteenth). This slim book is a biography which traces his Bavarian upbringing, time as a priest and academic, and ultimate election as pope.Ratzinger has a passion for the conservation of the values of the Catholic Church, this was reflected in his reaction to Vatican II, liberation theology and, more generally, his role as doctrinal ""enforcer"". It is only right that this biography was written by Greg Watts, who obviously shares Ratzinger's passion. Watts writes clearly, grippingly and succeeds at informing us intelligently about this unique and intriguing individual.If you enjoy this book, you may also like Benedict XVI: The Man Who Was Ratzinger by Michael S. Rose (ISBN 1890626635), which also sports a great review on Amazon by top-50 reviewer Orrin C. Judd. This book has an oddly similar looking cover to Watts'."
4,Elvis' biggest international hit single!,"""Now or Never"" was Elvis' biggest hit single worldwide. Released soon after his discharge from the Army in 1960, it quickly climbed to number 1 on charts in several countries including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland among others. It stayed at number 1 in the US for 5 weeks and would eventually be certified PLATINUM by the RIAA. This single left no doubt that Elvis was back from his two year stint in the Army! It even made the top 10 of the US R&B charts. It's flip side ""Mess Of Blues"" also made the top 40 in the US peeking at 32. While these songs are available on other CDs, this is a nice collector's item for avid Elvis fans."
3,not so satistfied,The book is mostly about application of finishes on various surfaces. Which finish to use when is less covered and for what I was looking for it referred to another of the authors books
3,A bit murky,"I found the book Quiet Crazy to be a little undefined. What you read on the inside cover is just what you get. There is no big and powerful ending, no pinnacle in the storyline, and no definite thoughts about the future. It's like ""a day in the life of..."" The story is predictable and not very exciting. If you are looking for a hopeless person who is ""cured"" through therapy, I highly recommend A Million Little Pieces. Quiet Crazy is rather boring and nondescript. The reader never does really find out WHY she is in therpay or HOW her sister died - or even if there ever was a sister! Try A Million Little Pieces - now there's a person who had a rough go at life!"
5,Moo...,"Don't let the English subtitles deter you. Dialogue is minimal in this black and white film, smuggled out of Iran in 1971. This is not in any way political that I can see, so I wonder what the government was trying to suppress here. It shows poverty, madness, a severe learning disability, theft, violence, murder, lust, superstition... If Iran doesn't have those, well, it's the only country in the world that can make such a claim.This is actually a moving, realistic portrayal of life in one of the most barren villages you're likely to see, and a damn fine movie. Great use of music, no special effects, wild variations in the volume level that annoy any little pussycats who may be sitting on your lap enjoying the film with you. So yep, redneck Michael enjoyed another Cannes Film Festival winner plans to watch it again."
5,"Extreme snowboarding, Buddhist magic, pushing the limits...","This book is going to make an incredible movie!""Snowboarding to Nirvana"" traces the athletic feats,romantic encounters and magical Buddhist experiences of a young American as he travels to the Himalayas with a backpack and two snowboards to snowsurf the highest and most majestic mountains in the world. Yet, at the same time, ""Snowboarding to Nirvana"" provides an incredible amount of practical information about how to meditate and bring Buddhist enlightenment and magic into your daily life that is real and not just a collection of nice ideas you read about. Initially, I read the book because it is an inspiring story that frees the spirit and makes the adventures of Jack Kerouac look common-place in comparison. Now, I continue to re-read the book because each time I do I find new ways and practical methods for improving my own life."
5,A modern day Enlightend Master's writings!,The writings of a modern day American Saint. Great fun and very humorous! It has given me tools to make every moment of my life a positive and enlightening one.
4,very quick and entertaining read,"ok ok...how many books on buddhism can you say are entertaining, exhilarating, and inspiring?this book does not profess to teach one anything other than being true to your inner strength and following your inner voice.i read the book in 1 day ...couldn't put it down...sure the tone of the writer was somewhat ridiculous but it came across as genuine which i think is more important than some of the high brow , mystical voices that other writers put on."
4,An eye opening book,"Snowboarding to Nirvana by Frederick Lenz was very interesting and made you think about life differently. It was an eye opening book.""Mark Pedersen# 1 Ranked Professional Windsurfer in Australia"
3,Coelho books a lot better buy!,"I found the book to be ok.Ok read!I've read Paulo Coelho and Robert Pirsigand Carlos Castaneda.This is an ok read for people who wantto feed this person's ego!You're better off readingThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho!I will read another book, I wasted my cash onthis one. Anyone want to buy my copy!I'm not impressed by people who thinktoo much! He thought too much and ingesteda lot because he was afraid to LOVE."
4,Great!,"I got this for my parents' 49er mini helmet. It looks great in it. It's a great product for the price. Others I looked at were much more expensive, but this has the mirror, glass, raised shelf, and fits nicely on the mantle. I think the pegs/legs might be plastic (I didn't spend much time looking at them), but it doesn't detract from how nice the whole display case is. I'd definitely buy the same one if I ever need one again. I think it's worth the price."
5,if you only buy one game for your kid....,"...this is it! Admittedly, my husband, 5-yr old daughter and I have probably played this game for more than 10 hours fromthe last 2 months, We love it! My 5 yr old can easily play and they're no gory parts. If a character dies, it just breaks into its Lego brick pieces. It is fun , always new chapters to explore, and free play is such a hoot, esp. with 2 players."
3,Recall Info,"Just found out about a recall notice for this game in January 2007. It says that some customers may have trouble with the game loading correctly. the return info is - Lego Returns Phone: 704-504-1877Lego Returns - OEM.8500 South Tryon StreetCharlotte, NC 28273"
4,"Great game, with a few annoyances","My 5 year-old and I love playing this game together. If you like Star Wars you'll get a kick out of this. Lot's of harmless fun with a cute LEGO twist. Gameplay does get a bit repetitive after awhile, customizing the controls is a pain, and you're stuck with the game saving only after you complete an entire level. My son gets frustrated when ""time's up"" in our world and he can't save the game part way through a level. But we've spent many quality hours together playing this and are almost done. Just make sure you periodically back up the lsw_# directory in the directory you install the game. We had to start over after about a week's worth of playing when the save game file in that directory got corrupted when the computer crashed. I wish they'd make more clean, fun games like this!"
4,awesome game!,"This game is awesome! Though it didin't go like the real star wars saga,But let me tell you some of the game. Well you first have to go to Episode 1 the phantom menace and play the chapter called Negotiations .Once you've unlocked that chapter you can keep playing the episode or go to episode II or episode III the last movie of star wars....Oh and if you havent seen it you should'nt play episode III,unless you see the third movie..and since there legos they don't talk much,well they dont say words...but I recommend this game to star wars fans!"
1,!! WARNING !!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! DEFECTIVE,"THE GAME WILL INSTALL BUT NOT PLAY. Probably because of the technology the game contains to prevent copying. Called Customer Service and got a recording that says ""LEAVE YOUR NAME AND PHONE NUMBER WE WILL CALL YOU BACK."" Yeah right. They better not charge for POSTAGE to get a working copy, if that even happens. What a rip. Eidis Interactive, stay away from this company they obviously have to Quality Assurance groups working within there walls! So, how do explain to a 8 year old that we spent $30 bucks on a game that wont work ?"
1,Parents- Be Forewarned!,"After spending literally hours trying to get this game to work on my 10 year old son's PC, we cannot figure out where the missing link is....video card? Memory? He has a Duron 1.6, 64 megs of RAM and a Radion 9200SE videoecard. Is it a coincidence that an ad for Nvidia Video Cards is the first thing to pop up on the screen when the Lego game loads in????? My son spent his own $$ on the game, and is heartbroken. As for me, I'm sick of the planned obsolesence of the computer industry. LEGO, are you listening?????"
1,Pixel Jaded,"Think your brand new PC will be able to handle this game? THINK AGAIN!!! Buried in the fine print of the requirements for this game is the horrifying truth. You have just wasted $30 because you don't have the correct hardware built in to your graphics card. And you can't return open software, sorry. You've been tricked like the rest of us.Now your 6 year old is in tears, and you are the bad guy because you won't spring for another $100 to upgrade your BRAND NEW COMPUTER. Lego, Eidos, and Giant are really making a name for themselves on this one!"
1,Shortest Lifecycle... EVER,"Installed, started, non-functional, exited, started, non-functional, exited, started, non-functional, exited, uninstalled.Move along, nothing to see here."
4,Lego's does it again,"It's hard to give a true review when this product was bought to be given as a Christmas present. Review is based upon other reviews, not my own."
2,Great Game but check your game pad first,"I have 3 kids ages 7-12 and they love this game. Story line follows very closely to the actual Star Wars Movies. However, we have had huge problems with our game pads configuring properly. I final had to send emails to tech support for help only to find out that they have a bug that causes problems if your are using a logitech wingman game pad (which we have two of). Three emails latter they could not offer any help other than to say ""The game's publisher and developer are aware of the problem, but a decision has not yet been made on whether to patch it. I apologize for the inconvenience."" Unfortunate for me the buyer! In my book this is not acceptable.If you buy this game ""may the force be with you"". If your using a logitech control you will need it!Signed Frustrated Jedi"
1,Defective disk delivered,"After waiting anxiously for this game to be delivered, we were very disappointed to get an error after installing. We went to the eidos web site and discovered that this is apparently a common problem and that the disk was defective. The web site gave an 800 number to call that went to an automated service with no information about the defective disk.If eidos knows there are defective disks then they shouldn't sell them, nor should Amazon continue to ship them. There will be some disappointed kids on Christmas day, just as mine are right now!"
4,"Great Game, but buggy","I loved the Lego Star Wars II game so I decided to pick up this one as well. The game is fun, but just not quite on par with Lego Star Wars II. It is a bit buggy, but there is plenty of support online. I had trouble with it starting after the first time I ran it. Turned out to be a simple problem to fix after reading the forums (just deleting a file). I would highly recommend this game to anyone!"
1,Installation problems and slow responses,"My kid has Star Wars 2 - The Original Trilogy, and we were very happy with it. So we wanted to try this other game, and we have been very disappointed. On one computer the installation failed, while on the other computer we were able to install it, but the game is slow and the characters respond very slowly to the keyboard commands. Very disappointed."
1,Ridiculous Hardware Requirements,"Luckily, I checked this out of the local library prior to purchasing it, because when installing it on my son's computer he got the imfamous pixel shader error, ironically, AFTER the install was almost complete... why not check that first?Anyway, I find it hard to believe Quake 4 has no problem, but LEGO STAR WARS with it's _advanced_ pixel shaded graphics can't run on his PC!!??? Utterly ridiculous."
4,"So I'm 28 and yes, I love LEGO Star Wars...","This is the kind of game I could just pick up and play for a few minutes or I could spend hours in front of the computer. On the surface it is a very easy game to play and finish, on the other hand there are many optional puzzles and quests that will keep an adult busy (and sometimes frustrated) for weeks after finishing the story of the game. Overall a great game for people of any age..."
1,"I'm out $20, and have a really pissed off kid...","We have Stars Wars II and I figured it works on my computer, so Star Wars must too. WRONG! In fact, it doesn't work with any Intel graphics card because of some pixel shader 1.1 thing. My kids were so disappointed. They spent their own money on this game, and there's no returning opened software. The tech support people at this company don't EVER answer the phone and NEVER return your call. I should have read the reviews first."
1,Shame On Lego!!!,"Whoever, at Lego, was in charge of overseeing the production of the Lego Star Wars PC game should be FIRED!!! I was amazed that a company the size of Lego would release a game for children that requires a PC configured for a hard core gamer who would not even think about buying this game. That Lego would collaborate with a company and allow them to build the software such that it relies upon and requires a video card which supports PIXEL SHADER technology is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Very, very few video cards support this technology. With most stores refusing to return software that has been opened, a majority of consumers will be out $30. Had I not raised my voice and created a scene at customer service, I would have been one of those consumers and the best I got was store credit. Before buying this software, please make sure that your PC's video card has PIXEL SHADER support."
1,Be warned!!!!!,If I could rate this game lower than 1 star I would.You need an NVIDIA Video card to play this game.My 2 month old PC doesn't support Pixel Shader 1.1 so this game won't run on it.My 9 yr old son purchased the game with his own money. I hope Lego and Eidos realize they have just lost a young customer (and his parents)Be very careful to check your video card before purchasing this game.
1,Frustrated!!,"This is the first PC game that I have ever purchased for my kids that I could not run because of not having pixel shader 1.1. Not only is the game expensive, but also disappointing once I had to explain to my kids that it doesn't work on our computer. Not only that, but eidos.com has no technical support available for this game at all, although they claim to in the instruction booklet. This game will be going back to the store ASAP!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Have not been able to use since our computer does not have the appropriate hardware (computer is 2 years old) so we will need to purchase an upgrade for the pixels for a mere $[...]. Needless to say, my son is very disappointed....HUGE waste of money!"
1,Poor service/product didn't work,"The software they send me did not work. After contacting them regarding a refund, I have not heard from them. I would recommend using someone else who is more reliable than this fly-by-night operation."
1,PC requirements are a drawback,"IF you are going to buy this game, FIRST make sure your PC can run it--alot of Intel graphic chips are not compatible with it. You have to have a Pixel Shader v 1.1 to run it or you will have big problems. My poor son wanted this game so badly, but when we installed it on our less than a year old HP PC, we couldn't get it to run because of this Pixel issue. Despite doing alot of research on the web, we still haven't been able to get it to work. And if you get some kind of fix, it can be a big drain on your PC or require alot of work. SO BEWARE!!!"
1,Another Defective Disk Story.,"I like several others had the problem where after installing it, the program said ""wrong disk inserted"".My son had played the demo first on this computer so it appears that our hardware meets the requirements.In all my years of buying games, I have never seen such a screw up like this.Very disappointing to my son at Christmas!1/4/05 It's been well over a week since I made the call for a replacement disk from Eidos. Still no response. Buy at your own risk!"
4,Do you have a pixel shading card?,"this game is really cool, but you have to have pixel shading for it to work. you will love it,it's just a matter of will it work."
1,Not usable,"This Star Wars Lego game will never be used. We need to buy expensive equipment so that grandson can use it. I wish there was some clear advice on the packaging and/or site. Unfortunately, it was money down the drain."
1,Get the console version,"This game looks great, and I've played the console (GCN,X-Box, ETC.) versions, so I had high hopes for this one when I got it for christmas. Guess this is the only one that costs MORE than they say. When I tried to install it, I too got the ""req. Pixel Sader 1.1"" crud. My dad nearly went balistic gone nutso when we had to upgrade our ram for another game, costing us 80 bucks. When we found out that our video card was the only barier and a new ""high-tech"" one cost at least $200 bucks, we nearly lost our heads he was so mad. Lego has never been kind to computers, and the fact that they still make this [...] is mind-blowing. Trust me, save some money and get a console version. It's the same thing for a lower cost eventualy"
1,A WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,I had both the defective disk problem AND the graphics card problem that many other reviews mention. AMAZON should be much more clear about the system requirements as this game will not work on many home PCs including my Dell PC that is less than a year old.Thanks for spoiling Christmas for my son. He assumed Santa normally delivered working product until this year!
4,Lego Star Wars a hit with my kids...,"While some of the scenarios can be somewhat challenging for those who are not superior PC gamers, based on my kids' continued interest in this game, there is plenty of fun to be had. The game stays true to the Star Wars spirit in story and in play. Although the play, not surprisingly, does fall into the Lego rubric as well.As far as the game being ""non-violent,"" the ""death"" of a non-player character is shown by it exploding into its Lego pieces - it is actually humerous. The player characters do the same but there is no maximum number of lives that ends the game."
1,Yet another bad disk from Amazon,"Same error and known problem: Wrong disk inserted. I ordered this from Amazon assuming they would be the most reputable source for this game. NOT!! It is absolutely pathetic that Amazon allows this kind of poor quality and a KNOWN defect to pass through their site. And yes, I also have a disappointed 8 year old wondering how Santa Claus gets bad disks..."
1,not compatable with vista,"Why are they still selling a version that's not compatable with Windows Vista? Your guess is as good as mine. And there are no drivers to upload to solve the problem. If you have Vista, don't buy this."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"You need pixel shaders v1.1 to play. I don't have that on either one of my computers. One computer is only 1 year old and top of the line. --- sonFrom Mom: My son played this game on a Game Cube and liked the game so we bought it, (...) when we were at Legoland. (It's not like we're going to drive all the way back to Legoland to return it). We come to find out that it needs some incredible video card -- it doesn't specify clearly the exact pixel shader on the box and this requirement is so different from all standard software that it should be mentioned pointedly on the box. We went on the web to look for solutions and only found dozens of angry and frustrated people in the same boat. We feel taken.Make sure you have the right stuff before purchasing this game. --- mom"
2,Terrible support,Bought this game for my 7 and 5 year olds (PC version). They played it for a week and were loving it. Then the game quit working. Tried tech support and got the instructions to e-mail an error log file to their support e-mail address. Got no response after 1 week. Tried again. Still no help. Called and put on hold for over an hour and then gave up.
1,Requires obscure hardware -- big disappointment!,"My son saw this at a friend's house, had a lot of fun with it, and we ordered it. To make a long story short, it won't run on my high end 2 year old HP laptop, since it requires an obscure video card running something called pixel shader. Unless you are 100 percent certain your computer will run this, don't bother ordering it!"
3,Great but flawed,"A great idea, and a good single-player romp if you're into breaking things.Forget playing through this in co-op. It's fun for a couple of levels and then you get to the pod racing. I played this on single player and found it frustrating but possible. However with someone else attached to you seemingly on a rubberband, constantly pulling you off course it becomes a complete nightmare. Just for the record I've completed all 3 GTAs since 3, Ninja Gaiden, and the first Halo on Legendary, so I'm not one to give up easily. Co-op pod racing will rob you of your enthusiasm for life."
1,Buyer Beware - if you have an Intel PC,"My son was in tears on his birthday because this game would not work on any of 3 PC's we have. If you have an Intel PC, it probably will not run this game. I have a Dell, and their technical support people told me they don't make a PC that will run this game. Your PC must have ""Pixel Shading 1.1"" support - most PC's don't have unless they are gaming PCs or have a special graphics card installed.Go to the Eidos Interactive website and download the demo software to confirm it will work on your hardware before you buy. Or look at all the posts in their support forum and talk of a class action lawsuit if you doubt me.Once the package is opened, you cannot return it. They don't post this system requirement prominently here on Amazon. Your son will open the package under the tree, and from that point on, you cannot return it or get your money back.I will not buy anything from Eidos Interactive ever again."
4,No Title,"Okay, am I the only person who will review this game, not how defective it is?Okay, so mabey everone except me hated the Phatom Menace, Clone Wars, and Revenge of the Sith, but lego star wars puts a charming twist contaning the first three episodes and with Legos(duh). You go through six stages(five on the Clone Wars) in every episode doing story mode first, then you can go back to the free play mode and go through the stage with a asortment of the characters which you already have.The overal story does mainly follow the 3 movies, the stages are incredibly short, with the bare minimum of puzzels, if you can even call them that.The 'side quests' are collecting tiny round bricks called 'studs' to get something called a Super-kit, which is a big Lego model. You can also find ten little models in each stage to find a regular kit, which is modeled after an object in the stage. Please, rent this game first, of play a demo."
5,Healthy eating,I love the food. I never realized there were so many different Herb and spices and what they were for. I always used Garlic salt instead of real Garlic. I replaced our regular salt with sea salt.Our cooking oil is now extra virgin olive oil. I am not only enjoying great food but healthier meals and I feel great.
3,nice recipes,"I ordered this book and Cholesterol Down. The Mediterranean Heart Diethas some nice recipes, but I found Cholesterol Down to be much more helpful in understanding cholesterol and why certain foods help lower it."
3,It is just OK,"I made some of the recipes and they are not very tasty or even interesting. Get another recipe book or even better ,[...]"
2,no title,"Not for people raised in the deep south and who have limited access to the ingredients in the receipes. Instead of buying this book just do what the doctors are always telling you. Cut down or out on red meat and eat more vegetables. Substitute fish or fowl in place of the red meat. Also do as the Apostle Paul said in the Bible, ""take a little wine for thy stomach's sake"". Then get out and walk more."
1,Faulty Information,"This is an absolutley ""terrible"" book. It first tells you what the Mediterranean Diet was many years and and how it is so helpful - THEN it tells you how to make bread with WHITE ALL-PURPOSE BREAD FLOUR. WHAT A STUPID BOOK. Then it goes on to tell you how to update the diet with new technology learned over the last century. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE DOING = THEY SHOULD BE TELLING YOU WHAT THE DIET ""WAS"" NOT WHAT THE AUTHOR THINKS IT SHOULD BE. And as an added ""insult"" they tell you to stop smoking. Do you think the Mediterranean""s ""Smoked"". Of course, and they were living longer than anybody on earth. What arrogance."
1,Bloodless,"This book is a total disappointment. It provides no sense of place, no feel for locales. It simply provides tables and statistics.It's a bloodless book. It's like picking a bride from a catalog with no pictures and no commentary -- just body measurements, IQ measurements, and test scores.The book is, in my opinion (of course), nearly useless."
2,Proof read!,"There seems to be some useful information in this book.However, the total lack of proofreading makes me question its accuracy."
1,Small World,"Big dissapointment. This book is supposed to rate retirement places and I expected a broad selection of choices around the world. But NOOOOO, it doesn't even cover America but only the US of A. Not what the title suggests."
4,Retirement Places Rated,"Almost more information than you can assimilate, it's amazingly informative. It can really help you find the place you want to be."
3,Good overview of regions of the country,"Previously I have used Places Rated for reference and it is much more comprehensive than Retirement Places Rated. This book focuses on smaller communities and is limited in that respect. It also gives general information about working in retirement, housing, medical care and personal safety that is readily available in other sources. The section on climate is most comprehensive and helpful. Otherwise, I will mainly use the links to websites for further information about communities of interest to me. Since I am more likely to retire close to a larger metropolitan area, this book is not a lot of help."
3,Retirement Places Rated,"Overall it is well written. I do miss the earlier format as is had much more statistical data. This current format is good for readers who don't like to really dig into the data and make more more analytical avaluations. I happen to like statistical data so I can slice and dice to come up with my own ""best choices"". I have the two earlier editions so I can cross reference to some extent. I really look forward to the next edition which will reflect the current foreclosure/subprime mess and possibly result in more affordable places to retire."
3,Where would you like to be in the next 5 years?,I had read the 6th edition at least 4 years ago and wanted the 7th edition to see if there had been changes to the Best places to retire. My main concern being the economy in the areas. Very little had changed some of the ratings changed and a few of the places. Over all it was the same book with more recent statistics.Retirement Places Rated: What You Need to Know to Plan the Retirement You Deserve (Places Rated series)
5,The hard (but very funny) truth.,"Michael Graham is a bit of an oddity in the world today. First of all, he is unafraid to tell you exactly what is on his mind, no matter the consequences. In addition, what he reports is the truth. This alone makes him nearly unique nowadays. In his book, Clinton & Me, he displays his mastery of the above two virtues as well as his mastery of satirical humor. From the first essay to the last you will be laughing, but more importantly, THINKING. The biggest problem in politics on a grass roots level these days is that so many people don't think anymore. Witness the vast number of ineffectual incumbents that get re-elected in this state alone. Michael Graham, both in his daily radio show and in Clinton and Me, he makes it impossible for you to merely tow the party line. Read this book. Even if you disagree with the politics, it will make you question your stance on each and every issue it addresses, and that is ALWAYS a good thing."
3,NOT THE BEST TENTH,"Well, I've been waiting for SONY to reissue this recording for a long time. Its reputation is well documented in the earlier listener reviews. Unfortunately, this performance leaves me disappointed. It starts out with an excellent first movement. Sonically it's everything you could hope for a mid-60's origin. As each movement unfolded however, it seemed that Mahler was less the composer. I know that other arrangers have had a go at the musical roadmap left at Mahlers death. The last two movements of this arrangement are threadbare indeed compared to normal late Mahler musical fabric. I end up wondering who to blame for the unidiomatic rendering, Ormandy or Cooke? Try out Wiggleworth's BBC live recording (also a Cooke arrangement)for a more satisfactory experience. Gielen on the Hannsler label is also excellent."
5,Just what I need,"These patterns are really great... I'm a beginner at scroll sawing, but with those patterns in hand, my work looks good... If your a Christmas fan, if you like all those Santa with flying reindeers and different ornaments, this is the book you need."
3,really basic patterns,"The patterns here are very basic. But they serve the purpose if you just want to cut out simple patterns to decorate, hang on a tree, or give away, etc. This book has a good variety of the ususal suspects - bells, santas, etc. Most are flat, some are corny. All seem to be fun.If you are looking for a challenge you need to look at the books that have a lot of compound patterns."
4,A Great Flick,"I grew up watching the Ma and Pa Kettle series on PBS on Sunday mornings. I was so excited to discover that they had been released on video, I was able to 'rediscover' these screen gems. Ma and Pa make me laugh out loud! I would recommend this to anyone who likes to revisit fun and innocent times."
5,Delightful,"My son really seems to enjoy this video. I was raised in a bilingual home and am hoping to teach our son French even though my husband does not speak the language. This is a sweet video with plenty of variety. My son comes to me now wanting to help and saying ""Voila, Maman"" just like Caillou."
4,Herbal Bonsai Practicing the Art with Fast-Growing Herbs,"This is the first book I have seen on the use of herbs as bonsai material. It is great book. It is informative and very descriptive with many black and white illustrations used to help explain text. Having only one-hundred pages, it is packed full of information on selecting herbs (including author recommended choices) suitable for use as bonsai. Training, developing, potting, shaping, caring for, and displaying herbal bonsai are all covered in detail. References and resources include mail-order nurseries. Terrific for beginners who don't want to invest a lot of money, but would like to try their hand at this hobby."
3,Probably a solid beginner book.,"I have already read many bonsai books, and this one didn't bring any techniques that I didn't already know. The herbs suggested (though not all herbs, per se) are relatively common plants. If you are a creative thinker and a bonsai enthusiast, you already look at things with an eye towards trying it out.If you're new to bonsai, and looking for inexpensive or quick growing plants to learn with, this book will be helpful. You'll want to find other books to teach the actual techniques though."
4,Mesmerization of Victorian Britain,"Alison Winter has written a thorough , well-researched look at mesmerism in Victorian Britain that is actually a thorough look at Victorian Britain through the concept of mesmerism. It was amazing to see how mesmerism touched on such Victorian concepts as gender relations, the emergence of science and medicine as a profession, and class relations. The chapters on mesmerism and colonial India, and the effect of the idea on mesmerism in changing the image of the homebound invalid were the most fascinating. All the famous characters from this period appear somewhere in this vast study. The metaphor seemed to stretch a little thin when reading and politics were added to the mesmerisic mix near the end of the book, although this was nevertheless very interesting. A good book that makes me interested to read more about this time period in Britain."
5,Queen Able,"This book has been on my coffee table since I first read it, and everyone who looks at it, wants one for themselves. I have given many as gifts.This is quite a remarkable woman who despite her ""disabilites"" had more abilities than people gave her credit for.Guaranteed to warm your heart and give you courage."
3,pretty good....,"Laurent as usual doing his thing, not bad! however the first 10 minutes are very boring. Forward through the first 10-15 minutes and the cd is actually very good."
3,"not bad, not terribly good","well i got this cd as part of the 3-cd set, ""the best of x-mix volume 2"". disc 3 (dave angel) is better, but this one (laurent garnier) isn't so bad.it contains a huge amount of variety...techno, trance, acid, house, it's all here, but i think techno seems to be the most common type.this cd is good to listen to, but tends to get a little repetitive, since most of the tracks don't actually go anywhere.all up, if you like the less commercial, deeper and darker style of techno/trance then this is a good cd.if you like stuff like paul van dyk, or scooter even, you may not like this cd too much!"
4,Great buy!,"I purchased this tunnel to accompany the matching Pacific Play Tent we had. My 4 and 2 year old boys love it! It is very durable when they play, and it is also very easy to store away when they are all done."
4,Love,My one year old and 4 yr old love it. My one year old plays peek a boo and rolls balls through the tunnel. We use it as an obstacle in the obstacle course for the 4 yr old. It folds up easily also.
5,1 year old loves it!,"My boy loves this. I got it for his 1 year birthday, but couldn't wait 2 weeks when it came, and gave it too him right away! If you have wood floors, it will roll with the little guy inside. Folds up easily."
5,Tunnel for 2 year old,Love this tunnel. It folds up very compact. It seems durable and it's light weight. My two year old and her older siblings really enjoy it.
5,Great toy for Children and Dogs,"I got this tunnel for my dog and she just loves it. I use it for practicing agility. But, she is also having fun running through the tunnel while play ball. If it's durable for a dog, then it would be great for children. I give it a A++++ all the way."
5,Mother of a 2 and 4 year old,I bought this tunnel when my son was around 15 months old. Now he is 4 and both my kids are getting so much use out of it. The tunnel is very durable and the primary colors look great in my playroom. My kids have come up with all sorts of different ways to play with it and it continues to last. I would recommend this product for anyone with little kids.
1,Cheap material Will tear in less than a day,Recently I just bought a new tunnel from you guys a rainbow colored tunnel with no windows that was cost about $30. I received the tunnel two days ago and there is already a tear in the material. It also feels and just looks cheap. I'm Not satisfied with this product at all. I have to add an update after emailing back and forth with the Pacific Play company they did send me a new tunnel as compensation. I really appreciated that this company made amends for the torn product.-Kataya-
5,"Well built, safe and fun!","We had the Discovery Kids tunnel and tent. Both went in the trash after a couple of months. The wiring tore through the nylon on that tunnel and the poles snapped in half. I found this and was ecstatic when I looked it over. The wiring has a foam padding of sorts wrapped around it inside the nylon, so much less likely to tear through the nylon. And the nylon is extremely durable. SO MUCH HAPPIER with this one than the last one!!"
3,"Fun tunnel, poorly constructed","I purchased the tunnel alone (not the attachable tent) for my 18 month old. She loved it from the start and immediatly crawled through a couple of times (barefooted). I have had it less than a week, and the seam arount the blue end of the tunnel began to unravel. My dauther had craweld through without shoes exactly 5 times befor the seam gave way. It't too much trouble to send it back, so I will repair it on my own and hope the other seams hold."
5,use the tunnel for my agility dogs,bought this tunnel for my agility dogs and it does very well...my granddaughter likes to play in it with my cesky terriers (agility dogs) they all love it!
5,Fun dog play tunnel,I bought this for my Siberian Husky puppy after seeing the high costs of the same item for dogs. It's nice quality and folds up easily with velcro straps. Perfect toy for your puppy to mid-sized animal. Nice quality product and bright colors.
2,Watch those eyes!,"My son liked the Elmo okay, but the eyes can be dangerous. He accidentally hit my mom in the face with them, and it knocked her glasses into her eye, causing bruising and swelling. He has also managed to hit himself a few times with those heavy eyes, and quicky gave up playing with it. I have contacted Toys R Us about this product."
1,Dangerous!,"If you ever get whacked in the head with the eyes by accident, you'll likely get a painful bump! He's very cute and makes a great decoration, but NOT a good toy for a little one."
3,It is kind of text book,"This book is roundabout for me.Because I just want to know vocabulary for Toefel.However this book gives a lot of questions ,then select the answers. It is kind of text book to use for school(ESL).I am looking for vocablary for Toefel, not test book."
4,very good option for SOME kids,"First, I do want to say that the nature of the fabric requires that you get those little elastic things to hold the corners in place under the mattress. Once we did that, it was fine. It is a fun thing and even fit under the upper bunk, which was nice. But the mesh windows did not do well with the washer/dryer, so you'll want to be careful about that. (I may not have followed the washing instructions, but wanted to get it CLEAN from accidents.) So we ended up having to cut out the mesh from the extra windows.I would recommend this UNLESS the child you're getting it for still wets the bed. I ended up having to wash it frequently, and was frustrated at the time required to thread the tent supports back into the tent each time I set it up again. It is now in the closet for when my son is older."
3,It's an okay toy,"We bought this bed tent for my son because he was having issues with bedtime and I thought this was a neat idea. At first he loved it but he wouldn't sleep in it and it slid around all the time, never fit the bed properly and we tried it on two different twin beds. Then our cats decided to use it as a litter box and I had to throw it away because I could't get the smell out. It was a fun toy at the time but he did become bored with it rather quickly, since it doesn't stay put I wouldn't recommend getting it. It would be nice if the bottom part was actually made of cotton and had elastic that actually fit on the bed properly. All in all I wasn't very pleased. Not to mention it costs too much for the material and quality."
3,Not like they used to be....,"I had a cabbage patch bed tent when I was younger and I loved it. That sparked my wanting to buy one for my son. I looked and looked for the ones with the sheet attached and this was the ONLY one I could find that had it so I went ahead and purchased. Overall, it's exactly the same as the one I had as a child. HOWEVER there is one flaw in this tent that caused us to use it only once and I haven't put it back up again. The bottom (the part that covers the mattress) is the same material as the rest of the tent. That silky nylon blend... which means .... my son falls out of bed over and over and over. It doesn't come off of our deep pillow top mattress, but it's so slippery that unless I put him to bed with no clothes on, he's sliding all over the place. It really is dangerous. Disappointing because he loved it. I wish I could return it, but having bought through an amazon third party that is usually easier said than done."
4,Great Bed Tent,This is the best. I am getting this one for our son as our daughter already has one {Secret Castle}. It fits like a sheet and I found a t-shirt sheet first helps the bed stay on better. We just got an egg crate mattress and covered it with her own sheets and it perfect!
1,Misleading photo from manufacturer,"I ordered this tent, for my special needs daughter because it had the zippers on the bottom and between with the additional mesh and the ability to totally close her in by lowering the flaps. Well......the picture is beautiful and exactly what I need for her but the actual product is NOTHING like the picture. There are no elastic straps to hold it on the bed (just a nylon sheet like thing barely thick enough to stay on a regular bunk bed thick mattress, no zippers all around the side, no extra mesh with the fold down flaps, and no side windows as pictured - just a rectangle toward the top is all. It does not appear to be as durable either as the other bed tents we have purchased from Target in the past - all 5 of my kids love them and this is the first one that hasn't been as pictured. I love Target so I am returning this tent and I will reorder one of the other ones because my kids really love having them to sleep in at night!"
3,"It's great as a ""man cave"" but hate the attached ""sheet""","My grandson loves this tent for his special place, but I dislike how the checkered ""sheet"" is attached and is loose on the twin mattress. The ""sheet"" is the vinyl/nylon whatever that this is made from, and I would prefer to have cloth that's washing machine washable or I could put regular sheets on the bed. It's all attached and one piece. Sheets/blankets slide around inside."
4,fun for my son...but slides off the bed because of the material,"My five year old son loved this...the only problem is it slides off the bed constantly...I'm not sure if that makes it worth not buying...as I didn't have alot of options since he has a full size bed. When I was a little girl I had a twinsize my little pony tent..this is what inspired me to buy my 5 yr old one. I never remember my ""my little pony "" tent sliding around...maybe they shoul make the material different on the part that covers the matteress or make it larger so that it can be tucked in. I do think it is worth the buy..keeps more space in your house but gives your child a fun place to play"
4,Disposable Chuks,"I found the bulk package to be quite a nice deal for the amount & the price. I was a bit disappointed that the chuks were not as absorbant as I had hoped. I wish they were comprised with more of the absorbancy material in their making. However, it means that I must be more diligent in the changing of them. I would be interested to know if the seller had the same product/deal in a more absorbant, quilted version. I did find the transaction with the seller pleasing with no drama issues. Always a plus. Rather, I just found the product a tad short of what I found myself needing. Would I reorder? Let me see when I finally run out! :-)"
1,Mildew smell,"Usually the pads are fine, but these were delivered smelling like mildew. The seller said they were brand new and the smell should go away when the package was opened.The smell never went away. He also said to just use them, use them on my bed smelling like mildew. NOT!!! What a waste of my money. I'm, awaiting a new shipment from another seller, hopefully these will be fine."
1,really awful quality,"this product is completely inferior to the ones i have purchased elsewhere. i don't know who the manufacturer is as they are completely unmarked and shipped in shrinkwrapped packages. but the plastic waterproof side is so thin and flimsy that it rips almost instantly. in addition the cotton filling on the soft side wads and bunches up rendering whole sections with no filling at all. i usually use one of these on my wheelchair cushion, folded much like one wraps a package. with these, however, i have to use two, since they shred apart after only one day of use. if you need these to protect against accidents in bed, just be aware that with too much movement the plastic tears which renders the whole thing basically useless."
3,"Uneven quality. Sometimes great, sometimes not","I use these pads to put on the floor in the spot where our geriatric cat urinates when he ""forgets"" where the litter box is. I've ordered them four or five times and have received varying qualities. One time they were so thin that they fit in a box barely larger than a shoe box. The last order were so thick and fluffy that they arrived in a large box nearly 20 inches on a side. The rest were somewhere in the middle. I use the link in my past orders each time, so I know that I'm ordering the same thing.I suspect that they buy from different manufacturers but I do wish that the quality was consistent. If you're lucky enough to get the thick ones, they're wonderful and would deserve a five star review. The thinnest that I've gotten would receive only one star."
5,Works for me!,"Purchased these pads for my Senior dog because he is incontinent at night. They work very well at keeping his bed dry. I place them under the bed cover and on top of his bed. Still need to wash bedding, but no longer worry that his bed is being soiled."
2,Not very good!,"I have tried many different brands of disposable chux and these are one of the worst. The only reason that I didn't give it 1 star is because the absorbency is average. The main problem is the top layer tears very easily, which makes for a useless underpad. This listing said the underpad was made by Dynarex, although the picture looks the same as many other underpad listings on Amazon. I tried a 17 x 24 underpad by Passport, which has the same exact picture and that one was much better. It's tough to figure out what your buying on here when all the pictures look the same. Good luck."
2,Wouldn't buy them again,The pads were really thin and didn't hold too much liquid. I would spend the extra money to get the chux pads from DH Medical.
2,not very good,not as high quality as store brand chucks but these are a fraction of the price and work well. not very absorbant but can be used as puppy training pads or for just incase liners for a childs bed.
2,Chux Underpads,"These pads have very little absorbency, but they were also very cheap. However, I will not order them again. I will spend a little more for pads that that will absorb more liquid. I use one a day for my paper trained Chihauhau."
2,ok,"The pads are thinner than I thought they would be and they leak just like any others I have tried. I use them as doggie pads and must put a piece of plastic under them and some paper towels on top of that so it doesn't go through to the tile floor. Not perfect, but it helps with 4 old dogs that can't always identify the doggie door!"
1,not what i expected,pads are very thin and dont hold much i have to use two and still dont work. the size is smaller than i thought also wouldnt advise buying them
5,Money Saver,"For quite a long time, I was purchasing puppy-training pads for my dog to use while I'm at work. She's no puppy; she's actually quite elderly. This became quite expensive, and as we all know, things are tough.A friend of mine turned me on to this product and I took his advice. The doggie is using them, despite the fact that they're not scented with ""doggie-come-hither"" aroma. The end result is that I'm pleased with the savings and the dog doesn't seem to know the difference.I recommend these highly for absentee-pet-owner use. And if they work for a dog, they would also work for a person.This product couldn't be better. I'm extremely pleased with both the product and the savings. Can it get better than that?"
2,Poor quality,We use these as pee-pee pads for our small dog. These were lightweight and had to be doubled to prevent leak thru. I would not get these from this vendor again.
2,Disappointing!!,"Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Large Size 23 X 36, Case/100 2 Bags of 50by Dynarex This product has the most cheap quality that I've had. I received the package and just trying to unfold one pad, it rip apart. If you can afford something better try other options."
1,Does Amazon WANT people to shop elseware ????,Amazon had better STOP THE BAIT & SWITCH or they will lose customers in droves. People do not like being ripped off after they have purchased a good quality item only to come back later and be switched to an inferior product. Wake up Amazon....in this economy people cannot afford to have their money wasted.
1,CHEAP IMMITATION...BEWARE!!!,"I originally purchased this product in November 2008, they were incredible. To repurchase in March 2010, I went back into my amazon.com order history, and used the same link to get to the product, and purchased some this month. They are terrible. These are not real chux, look for the same listing, but the seller is Northshore Care, those are the real deal. These are paper thin, and leak. STAY AWAY!!!"
2,disposable underpad,"i use this underpad for my dog. i don't recommend to buy this product because it's very thin, it does not obsorb the urine, it just slip all over the pad and to the carpet. i bought before a diffrent underpad that was thick and fluffy but forgot from who i ordered it."
5,Top of the line Chux outweigh other brands,"I did not realize how one brand of Chux disposable pads differed from another until receiving these pads. They are softer, thicker, quilted and a little larger than the pads which were obtained at the hospital and purchased from two medical supply facilities in South Florida. I've become a rock star with the Nurse's Aides who find them to be more absorbent, less flimsy and actually are more attractive than the others. These are used for an adult during the night and they are saving the bed pads, sheets and the patient's body. If they were on Subscribe and Save, I'd sign up today."
1,Paper towels,These pads are nothing more than paper towels lined with plastic backing........they don't have the cotten filler that the better underpads use.I was very dissatisfied. Will not purchase again.
4,very quick delivery,"product okay but the time of product delivery is really spactacular. I ordered today, it feels like I got the product the same day!"
3,Underpads,"These underpads are fairly absorbant, but as with most of these types of pad, they slide and tend to stick to the body when you move. Better than others we've tried. . ."
2,Not that great for puppies...,"After reading a ton of reviews on puppy pee pads, I decided to buy these instead for my 3 month old Pomeranian. We are attempting to train him to use the pad. Other reviewers suggested buying these and cutting them in half so that is what I do. And my puppy does use them... most of the time. But then he tears them apart if given a couple minutes unsupervised. The crap gets everywhere and there is always a huge mess to clean up. If you don't cut it then it is harder for him to tear it apart but he still does it and then you waste money because after he pees on it once, it soaks through and has to be changed right away. It is not very absorbent at all. A tiny 3lb puppy is using it and his pee puddles are small so I cannot imagine it would be good for bigger animals or for people. I won't be buying these again. I think I will go back to buying regular puppy pee pads next time."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY,The pads were so thin you could nearly see through them. Also came so compressed they appeared to be shrink wrapped. No savings at all and the quality there was none. Will never purchased from this company again!
3,very thin,"these underpads are very thin. they are for light duty jobs only. i place it on top of the changing pad for my baby since she tends to give me surprises when i change her diaper. because it's very thin, often it doesn't absorb the urine quick enough and ended up soaking her clothes."
3,Not What I was expecitng.,"I was expecting a chux that was a little more durable than this. This has a nice waterproof side, but the paper product practically melts and makes a mess when it gets wet. I use it for changing clothes and such, but I do not use it as a chux I leave on the bed. It's great if you are wanting it for quick and brief protection of a surface, but I will not be planning on using these directly under my patient in their bed. It's just not substanial enough."
3,"Ok, but not great","I got these hoping to use them for speech recognition, but as I type this using speech recognition, I'm actually using an old clip on microphone that I bought with a Sony Walkman years ago, because it works just as well, and is more comfortable to wear. I find the ear pads too tight to be comfortable to wear, and I did not notice any appreciable improvement in the speech recognition using this headset."
1,Does not work with Rosetta Stone / Mac,"Despite what Rosetta Stone and the headset maker claim, the mic does not work with Rosetta Stone on a Mac."
1,Head set to use for Skype/Magic Jack,"The one star indicates the lack of product reliabilityMicrophone won't work on either on of my computers. Skype diagnostics say everything is fine. (won't work on Magic Jack either) I got it the day I left for vacation out of the country for three weeks, packed without checking and found out en route. I just expected the product to work. Before I left I tossed the box it came in so I can't return it. Its been a month now so it looks like I'm out. (Perhaps a return would have done the trick for me but timing is everything and half of this item doesn't work) Headphones on music is good but that's not what I bought it for."
2,Headphone works Microphone SUCKS,"I am not happy about the quality of this headphone, I can not use it on messemger, yahoo, or skype, the connection breaks up, appearantly I cannot be heared by the other party I am talking to. But I do hear through the headphone, only the microphone does not work. So I am a very unpleased and un-happy user of this Cyber Acoustics USB Head and Micro-phone"
1,False Advertising...does not work on Mac OS X,"In multiple places, this product claims it works on Mac OS X. Well, it doesn't. I have never returned a product to Amazon in my history with them, but I guess there is always a first.While audio output works fine, audio input does not work at all.Amazon and Cyber Acoustics need to clean up the product descriptions here or clean up the product. Because this product does not work on Mac OS X. In fact, when plugged in, it shows up as ""Unknown USB Audio Device"". While the Product Manual on the Cyber Acoustics web site states it is Mac compatible, all of the installation and troubleshooting instructions reference a Windows PC.So, not only was it delivered a day late (one of my few misses with Amazon Prime), but it was a dollar short..."
4,No problems,Product works fine for Rosetta Stone. I have not had any problems with it. Good for the money.
4,Works ok and for OS X users,"Pros: Cheap, solid constructCons: hurts ears after prolonged use like 3 hours +Needs a driver anything above Mac OS 10.1This is a perfect product for your PC gamer and anyone in general who does a lot of online conversing. Not suitable for people with larger heads or ears.For Macintosh/OS X users!!Here is a driver that will work for this headset.http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11730/usb-audio-driver"
2,I didn't get the headset!!,"I never got the headset!! It seems the shipper (office depot) sent my address incomplete to USPS so the package never arrived!! I tried calling Amazon, Office Depot, even USPS, no one could help me! So, I never got the headset!"
4,Good headset to have,I don't know if it's all USB headsets or just this one but it has a couple of really good points:First of all you have the ability (in your Control Panel under Sounds and Audio Devices) to set up your sound were anything using voice recording or playback exclusively uses your headset where as all other sounds go through your main speakers and any recordings you'd like to make can still be done through your other microphone without having to change settings every time you'd like to make an internet call or voice chat.Next the audio quality and mike response is not exceptional but it's still really good. The noise cancelling works well and allows you to talk without completely muting your voice.Over all its pretty solid and I'd recommend it to anyone over a headset you have to plug into your sound cards audio out and mike jacks.
3,headset USB - NOT for Rosetta Stone!,"Product works normally, but fails to work with the Rosetta stone language software. I found this product on Amazon while looking at a similar product on Rosetta Stone's website. Since it was cheaper on Amazon I bought it there. Caveat Emptor...."
2,No thank you,"I bought this headset to make free calls online via Google Voice and paid calls via Skype. I can hear everything just fine, but 9 times out of 10 the person I am speaking to reports that I am ""breaking up"" and today on a conference call there was loud feedback for all of the other callers coming from my headset. I am replacing it with a model that uses a 2.2 jack rather than USB. Would not recommend this headset for internet phone calls."
3,uncomfortable,"This headset is okay ! but, it is very uncomfortable . I would prefer an adjustable headset without a usb hook-up instead ."
1,***Don't Buy***Wastage of money***,"There is almost no positive to mention about this product. I can list out some of the negatives to help who is planning to buy this.1. Not comfortable to ear. You are gonna have pain on your ear, if you wear formore than 30 mins.2. Sound Quality is somewhat okay3. Not dependable...This one stopped working after 2 months.So whoever thinking of buying this, buy it only you are not bothered about these troubles...Thanks"
5,Uniden cordless system,The system does what it the description says it will do. Sound is clear and the answering machine is easy to use. I like the fact that you only need one plug in to the phone line and you can use 3 hand sets.
4,uniden tru9485-3,Excellent features.Performs well in all situations.Only one fault keeps it from getting five stars.When I am in my office (farthest point from home base)I wiil sometimes get static if my body is between the handset and home base.
2,Dead after only a year...,"We received this phone Christmas 2006 as a gift. Within the first month we had to return one of the handsets to Uniden for a replacement since the volume level kept going out. The phone has worked fine until January 4, 2008, when we had a power outage (living in a mountainous area, we've had them before with this phone). When the power was restored 22 hours later, the base handset only displayed an E4 code. After contacting Uniden, they said they would replace it (they don't do repairs) if it was within the one-year warranty and with a receipt but since it was just over the one year and I don't have a receipt (it was a gift) this phone is now basically trash. I will not buy another Uniden."
4,Better than the Panasonic system that I'd had,"I had a prior Panasonic cordless system that was picking up all of my neighbors calls. This system is not doing that. However, it does have the annoyance of phasing in and out occasionally. I'll be conversing with someone and they get very hard to hear, then it will come back.I find the answering machine to be a little confusing, but otherwise, I'm happy with the system and it is a great improvement over my previous one. The convenience of putting extensions whereever you have an electrical outlet is teriffic."
2,"Lots of features, lots of static","I am impressed with the number of features of this phone. The static, however, overshadows any great features. I would not purchase these again."
2,Uniden TRU9485-3 Review,"I was very happy when I received the phone and read about its features. But this phone doesn't work for me. When I connected it I started to get frustrated because it doesn't work as I expected, specifically the range that it covers. I place the base unit in a central place of the house and I couldn't use the cordless in my bedroom or in the kid's bedroom or outside the house as I use my old cordless system. Before this, I had a 2.4 Ghz Panasonic and it work perfectly every where around the house and outside too and when I bought the Uniden I expected at least the same performance. Finally I had to by another phone, a 5.8 Ghz Panasonic, and it works better than this Uniden, but not better than my old 2.4 Panasonic. Now I'm thinking that the problem is in the frequency that doesn't have good penetration and can't cover a good range, so I'm thinking to buy another 2.4 Ghz Panasonic"
4,"Good phone, good value","Overall, this was a good phone system, and a good value. Range is great, quality is excellent, and the ease of use is good. Their selection of ring tones isn't great (even though they have many), but that shouldn't steer you away from this phone. Don't know of another phone that has a good ring tone."
2,Quality not great,"I bought this phone based on other reviews. Have since discovered that although the phone is OK, it has a problem of the volume fading lower and lower while you are talking and I have actually had to pick up an extention to finish the conversation. The phones are all properly and fully charged so that is not the problem. I suspect that the problem is in the handsets, but I 'm not sure how to return the phones and haven't done so yet."
5,Excellent phone system.,"No need to repeat everything that others have said, but in general I concur. Sound quality and range are excellent. It would have been nice to copy the entire phone directory from the base to the satellite phones as opposed to doing it entry by entry. The short back light time can be annoying, and you do have to erase Caller ID info from each phone, which is rather inconvenient. The one-button dial feature for nine numbers is a plus, especially since many other brands don't offer it. Despite its few drawbacks, this is a great phone for the money. A ""PS"" in response to another review: if being able to cradle a phone between your shoulder and face is important, good luck with virtually all modern phones. Not a convincing criterion."
5,Uniden phones,"Exceptional quality, easy install and fantastic reception...highest recommendations...offers versatility without the big bucks!!!"
2,Good and Bad,"Pro: This phone has more features than I have ever see in a cordless phone. The features are excellent and other companies should take notice and follow suit.Con: The battery life on each charge SUCKS. For a phone just coming off the charging stand, you would expect it to last more than a week with 3 or 4 calls. This phone won't make it. So ... if you put it down and misplace it, don't count on ringing it to find it."
3,mixed reviews,"speaker phone reception is great.bad reception when far from base. our old phone had better reception at our workshop. with this phone, there is a lot of static.you have to go through several steps in order to insert a ""1"" in front of the caller ID number in order to return the call or store in memory. my old phone gave that option readily.i still am not able to make a 3way call. i used to be able to do by just pressing flash. doesn't seem to work with this one.i like that the numbers light up when you dial -- quite important at our age :)i like that when you press a speed dial number, it shows you the number (which means you really do not have to memorize the speed dial number you assigned to a number).will i choose this phone over our old phone? well... i wish all their good features were in one phone! it's like the search for the perfect purse! :D"
4,Cordless Phones,Very impressed. Especially like the Caller I. D. that comes on screen when talking to another party.
3,Good phone with a problem,"I like this phone system very much but I've had problems. Twice now, one of the handsets has gone dead. I contacted Uniden and they sent me a new battery--that handset then went dead again about a week later. I took it all back to the store and exchanged it for another of the same brand/model. It worked for a couple weeks then a handset went dead again. I'm taking it back again today and finding something else. It's too bad because I like everything else about the phone."
2,"Uniden TRU9485-3 Expandable Cordless System with Digital Answering System, Dual Keypad, and Call Waiting/Caller ID","I find the design of this product somewhat deficient. If you hold it too close to your head, you can accidently press the disconnect button with your ear. This has happened on several occasions. The message announcement does not say when the call(s) were received. It announces the number of messages received and the current time. Shipping was prompt and packaging was very good."
4,"Great phone system, but one occasional problem","We really love this phone system as it doesn't conflict with our wireless internet service. Reception is great, no static, range is great. I've taken one of the handhelds outside, across the street, and into the neighbor's basement without any problems. However, what perplexes me is,.. after that great performance, how can I pick up the handset from the main base (and from the main base where it has been charging for two days), dial a local number, get a ring or two on the other end, then get static and a message on the handset that the handset is too far from the base when I'm no more than 18 inches from the main base!?????!!!!!!!!!!????????? I'm taking a star away for that. Oh, and it has happened a couple of times, so it is not a once in a lifetime occurance."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am pleased with these phones. They are easy to use, very reliable, and are rated the best of their kind by Consumer Reports. I would definitely recommend these phones to a friend. They are 20x better than the Motorola cordless phones I had previously."
3,Reg TCX905 with 9485 issues,The Uniden 9485-3 system works great. However I can't get the TCX905 to register with the 9485 base system - followed the Undiden instructions three times. Any thoughts?
2,Not built to last.,"I have owned this system for a couple of years and had to buy new handsets twice. The caller ID and phonebook buttons just stop working after 9-10 months. This means you have to dial with the base and transfer the calls to a handset. If you lean your head against the handset, it hangs up. Additionally, if you try to talk near a large metal object, like a refrigerator, your voice dissolves into static. Try another brand."
2,uniden phones,"This phone has all the great features of a cordless phone but its life expectancy was very short. The buttons on the phones stopped working, then after about a year the batteries wouldnt last five mins after being charged all nite, then the base startedlosing touch with the phone until it just died and never worked again. This phone didnt last 2 years and I had to buy new phones. I have had uniden phones before these and they were great phones that lasted over 10 years.DISAPPOINTED IN UNIDEN!"
3,Features are Great but reception was poor,"Like the previous reviewer, I also had an issue with the volume fading during the conversation. It would eventually come back if I walked closer to the base, but it was quite frustrating. I also had an issue with poor reception/static when I was on a different floor of the house than where the base was located. The distance was well within the published range, and I live in a standard, wood-frame house. I have not experienced these problems with other cordless systems. I called Uniden support, but the wait times were ""over 15mins"", so I am just returning this product. It really is a shame, as I was looking forward to using this feature-rich phone system for years to come."
5,Wolf at the Door,"Lee is having a little trouble for what she is going to do in her life. Until one day she saved Ruthie a young female wolf.But what is she going to do with a whole pack of wolves and a crazy neighbor? This is a story of adventure and and a few chapters of sad and misery.Plus a terrified actress sister who won't even dare to look at them but ends up being a hero to the wolves anyways. "" This book literally made me think that I was at Flathead Lake with a whole pack of wolves and one lone wolf."""
2,Golden Greats but poor fidelity,"Truly GREATS: Ellington/Goodman/Basie/Coleman Hawkins/Gene Krupa on and on 68 in all BUT VERY POOR SOUND. LPSs of the same material sounds 8 times better, unless you might have poor equipment to play your records. Other Disky products sound better."
3,Disheartened and Disturbed,"While the product is a welcome addition to the ""Happy Family"" line and an excellent idea in the ever expanding world of Barbie, my 6 year old daughter and I were disheartened that the ""family photographs"" included on the sticker sheet did not reflect nor depict the African-American family we purchased, hence, the 3 star rating. If you choose to purchase this particular product be aware that the accessories included will not reflect the product in the box. To a 6 year old little girl this was incomprehensible. She felt it detracted from the realism of the product which affected her pretend play. While we purchase dolls representative of all cultures we predominantly buy African-Amer. dolls because we are."
3,Play with caution,"Grandma and Grandpa Kitchen can be more fun it it were more durable . It is not durable at all. Grandpa went to set down and broke his bones in both of his legs. By the way, he must not be made to sit, only stand. You know that is very hard on an old man!MY neice was over and she decided she wanted to give Grandpa a break and give him a rest, she went to position him to a sitting position and both of his legs broke! If he were real, we would have to call EMS and send him to the hospital! Poor man!!This was a Christmas gift to my daughter and she cried her heart out. We only had Grandpa a few days. I was not happy when Grandpa broke his legs either. Not only to mention about the doll, the table and chairs seem to be flemsy as well. Barbie , you just don't make things like you use to!"
5,Granddaughters love this toy,"I'm told my 6-year old twin granddaughters love the grandparents' kitchen. I haven't been told of any drawbacks, other than keeping the small pieces away from smaller children. We are also a multi-racial family, and I'm the white grandparent, but the African-American dolls matched their complexions better, so I chose them. I don't think it matters one way or another to the granddaughters. They have white and Hispanic Barbie dolls, too. I think it would be a good idea for the grandparent dolls to be made in Asian and Hispanic versions, though, since the children seem to love them. Having them available to purchase individually, too, would be a plus, so you add on to a collection and have all the grandparents represented."
3,okay,I like this toy a lot but the grandpa's head looks like it is about to fall off. The one chair with the booster seat does not unfold right. And there is a lot os small pieces that can get lost easily. Another thing is that the little card board pieces rip easily. One other thing that I do not like it that the grandparents hair is as hard as a rock. Other than that this kitchen is okay.
2,"Great idea, poorly made","We got this toy for Christmas for our little girl and were highly disappointed in it. The toy itself was a great idea, and would have been a 4 or 5 star if made better.However, this toy was very very poorly made. From the second it came out of the box it had problems. The latch button on the side was too hard for our little girl to get open to start with. Then, once open, the doors on all of the cabinets and fridge refuse to stay shut and everything just falls right out. On top of that, the space between the cute little kitchen counter and the table is so small that the dolls hardly fit in the chairs in that space it's so tight!It's really too bad, because if they had put more effort into better design this could have been a great toy, but because of the poor design I do not recommend it at all, that is unless you like to waste your money on toys that fall apart the second you pull them from the box and that your kid can't even get into on their own."
3,A Grandma's review,I am a Grandmother of 12. I enjoy playing with the set. Howeverthe grandma could use more grey hair. It would be nice if grandpa could sit down.It would also be nice if you could make them the skin color ofShani doll. I agree that the set takes a great deal of care for a six year old. Help for the stiff hair: take the clothes off and rinse the hair in cool water with-out getting water down the neck.Ellena A. Miami Fl.
5,LADY BUG TENT FOR GRAND DAUGHTER CHRISTMAS,I just got a phone call from 4 year old grand daughter. They live 1500 miles away. She is so excited she gets to sleep in her tent tinight. Big ennough for all 3 grand children.
4,"Fun, fun, fun","I have two grandkids (18 months and 9 months) and this was a Christmas gift for the younger one. We set it up in the livingroom at Christmas and they played in it for a long time. Although one could not yet crawl and the other one kept trying to stand up in the tunnel. They laughed and played peek-a-boo through the tunnel. Since then the tunnel has been in our granddaughters bedroom for her to crawl through and play in, just waiting for the weather to get warm enough to set it up in the backyard. It is made well and should withstand the kids playing in it for a long time. Love the bright colors and cute ladybug eyes."
4,Love it!,"My daughter was 17 months old when we purchased this tent and she loves it! Putting it together and taking it down is extremely easy, so we have had it both outdoors and even indoors on occasion. Also, it folds up very small and is easy to store when you aren't using it. She drags her toys in and out of it and has the best time!"
4,so much fun,"This tent has been one of the best toys we've ever bought. It occupies several children at a time and allows them to be creative, imaginative, and just ""have fun"". Our daughter spends many hours in it alone too, and even enjoys ""camping""- sleeping, in it."
2,Great Quality,"I was very satisfied with the product. Well made with lots of room. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a nice extra toiletry bag that looks good and will last forever.Joe, from Enfield Ct."
4,Travel Kit,"The trim on the travel kit I received is not brown, like in the picture, but it is tan like on the ""Danielle Enterprises Monaco for Him Travel Kit with Dual Zip and Velcro Opening, Hunter Green"". A little disappointing but I won't be using it in a fashion show. Just letting you know you may not get what's pictured. Otherwise it's an OK deal."
4,'I didn't know he had super powers...',"'Can A Brother Get Some Love' was hilarious! I loved it from the beginning to the very ending! He rocked the show from talking about today's issues and bringing laughter into real life situations. My favorite was his joking about the political disrespect, he told the truth but gave you a funny viewpoint! Simply priceless!! I can't wait for his next stand up!!! Kudo's Mr. Crawford!!! 4.48"
2,Waste of money,This video wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It was a waste of money. I should've waited for it to air on cable.
5,Lavell crawford-Can a brother get some love?,"Soooooo funny, Lavell really did his thing on this one. He holds the crown right now of the funniest stand ups i've watched lately."
5,Incredible book and down to earth beautiful woman,"I have the wonderful opportunity to meet Sonya twice socially before I read her book or knew what she did. She is a fabulous person, caring, loving and true blue honest. Her book has given me more understanding of my pets (various ones..horses, donkeys, dogs and a sheep). She gave me insight to communicate with them and understanding why they do what they do. She is a true blessing for animal lovers everywhere. Thank you Sonya!"
2,More than a bit disappointed with the content,"Based on the subtitle of the book, ""Developing your Innate Telepathic Skills ..."" I was expecting a how-to book. One that would walk me through developing a line of communication with my parrots. What I found was an autobiography of the author's life as a communicator. While I thoroughly enjoyed her stories and case studies, it was not at all what I expected. I've always believed that every animal can think and feel emotions, but I've never been able to truly communicate with my pets in human terms. I was hoping this book would teach me that. But it certainly didn't. It contains only one page with a ""steps to take"" which basically said 1. Relax 2. Concentrate 3. Give it time to develop."
4,Amazing,"Sonya Fitzpatrick is simply amazing. Even skeptics have toadmit that she opens their eyes to their pets' points of view,~however~ she does it. For those who want more information on contacting her, Learn. Enjoy. Love your pets. END"
3,Contacting Sonya Fitzpatrick,"For those of you who are trying to find Sonya Fitzpatrick, I sympathize with you. It took me hours and I live in Houston! Here's what I found:Sonya Fitzpatrick 395 Sawdust Rd. Ste.2003 Woodlands, TX 77380 281-364-0608Good luck to all of you."

Can someone help? Idon't mean the arch, I gotthat just fine, I mean thefence-like thing.BTW, the grandparents are Midge's parents!Overall,great set, I'mglad I bought it! :)"
1,Screwed,Love the Menace Clan and this album but didn't realize I was buying the screwed version. Screw music is part of the reason rap is so bad now. Stop screwing albums that don't need to be screwed. Only screw the albums of artists who can't rap! Go buy Green Leef of D.O.C.: The Restoration
2,"Be Very, Very Careful!","While Santelmo's book is valuable for all the interviews with early GI Joe creators, collectors who have not had experience handling rare items can be easily misled by the many photos of so-called ""prototypes"" which were ""re-created"" for the book. Because the ""re-creations"" are not clearly marked there is significant concern that when these surface in collecting circles they will be thought authentic because of their association with the book. The price guide is also virtually useless as it undervalues some very rare pieces and wildly overvalues some more common ones. Buyer Beware!"
2,Why Another Edition?,"It seems very strange that Santelmo adds to an otherwise useful collector's guide a whole bunch of material taken from John Michlig's book, GI JOE: THE COMPLETE STORY OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE MAN OF ACTION. Why not do inexpensive updates to the collector information without all the poorly written ""history"" at the beginning? 592 pages? Under half of those pages are useful.The collector book by Derryl DePriest is much better, leaner book for collector's, and the Michlig book is a better book for the history of the product."
2,"Fun photos, some fakes","This book for some reason includes re-creations of proto-types. How do you recreate a prototype? Sounds like a dumb idea to me. ...I don't know, but I liked the book mostly because of the interesting photos of GI Joes, and the information that it added to what I already know. The parts of the book (like the value guide) which I thought were garbage I just skipped over. There are lots of entertaining photos in the book, and interesting information too. Is it some kind of Collector's Bible for GI Joe? No, I don't think so."
3,Book,"Interesting to a point, but not what I was looking for. I wanted more about the storyline, not the product line. But for collectors of the actual toys, this is a perfect fit."
4,The Updated 3rd Edition of A Useful GI Joe Reference,"This is the latest, 3rd Edition of the very popular ""Encyclopedia"" of GI Joe collecting. This 1"" thick, 512 page book has more than 1,000 black and white photos, and a super 48 page large, sharp, full color picture section. It has a very useful, complete table of contents making item location easy. Values are provided. I found this volume most interesting and useful. GI Joe fans will find it of value, just as the popular previous editions."
1,Not worth the upgrade,"I can't find a reason why anyone would upgrade to Flash CS3 from CS2.It's the same interface, apparently most of the same features, and not significant enough to upgrade. I'm actually let down that Adobe seems to care so little about this product, given the widespread use of Flash video on the web today.One of my biggest pet peeves that I had hoped would be fixed in this version but wasn't, was the inability to trim videos by punching in times rather than using the slow and inaccurate scrubber. What a terrible, terrible way to trim video."
3,inspiring with a negative note.,"It is vivid, and inspiring, but for a foreigner it is full of hard-to-follow references, connotations, subtexts related to the Town. And that holds true for a foreigner who loved and lived the city for couple of years. As for the style, Berman is actually a poet in my mind."
3,not as good as i was expecting,"The interviews are very cool, and many of them are quite funny. The songs however are bad. It's not Marilyn Manson, it's the Spooky Kids and all the songs (on disc 1) are live and the quality of the sound is horrid. All the interviews are from the antichrist era, and like i said are good....i wouldn't say 35 dollars good in any way though. If you desperatly require to hear manson and twiggy's voice, go ahead and buy it, but if it's the music you want, i would highly recommend just buying the 2004 release ""Lunchboxes and Choklit Cows"" the quality is great on that album! As for the second disc, it's a cool idea to give all the bands from the spooky kids era in florida a second chance, but as you listen you can immediatly tell why manson made it and they didn't. So the disc is alright, but not 35 dollars alright. I give it three stars for the interviews, the thought of the second disc and herpes is just a cool song."
1,dont waste your money,"Do not waste our time with this product, it is nothing more than a bootleg, one disk is all live recordings that are horrible quality, the second disk isnt Marilyn Manson at all, its mainly just instamentals that, from what i can tell, the creator made himself. This product blows and i wish didnt waste my money on it."
5,WOO! IM THE FIRsT PERSON TO REVIEW!!!!!,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM THE FIRST PERSON TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT. Ok, its very good! Manson is SUCH an intellectual and its great to hear him interviewed! The songs are also good and im the first person to review this product. I dont even know what it is! But Marilyn Manson rocks!"
1,Extremely disappointed...,"I have been planning a ""backyard"" water park for my sons 5th birthday. We were so excited to find this ""bubble blowing sprinkler"". However, when we opened up the box and set it up, we were extremely disappointed. Our water pressure is very good so that's not the problem. We hooked the sprinkler up and the water only goes about 3 1/2 feet high. And the bubbles? What bubbles? You get about 1 to 2 inch bubbles that barely make it out of the ""machine"" and float right down to the grass. They do supply you with 2 small bottles of bubbles, however, each bottle lasts between 5 and 8 minutes. And don't you dare get any water into the bubble reservoir, although since it's a water sprinkler also, this is unavoidable and impossible. Please, don't waste your money. My son and I are both extremely disappointed."
1,Gazillion bubbles or none at all?,"We had high hopes that this toy would work as advertised. But it didn't produce a single bubble on it's own. I DID read and follow the instructions, but still, no bubbles. It seemed like it was built well and an innovative design. Still, those don't help if it doesn't deliver. There was good water pressure and the fan was cycling correctly with good air output and all of the little bubble-makers were rotating but no bubbles. Oh well, yet another poorly-tested Chinese piece of trash."
4,"very well written, full of good information","The Maffetone method is not revolutionary and is not a break-through. Hence the title of this book may be a bit misleading. The MAF method is simply low heart-rate walking in order to burn maximal amounts of fat (instead of carbs) while exercising.The author makes a very strong case for something that any runner knows: slow running builds fitness, is easy on the joints, and also is maximally effective in promoting weight loss. What makes the book strong is the author's ability to take the time and explain the rationale behind this method of slow aerobic burn. I appreciate mixing theory and practice and presenting his case in an intelligent and learned manner.For those who are not exercisers and who are looking for weight loss, this is a very important book to explain the rationale and get one going.The book is best used in conjunction with a heart rate monitor."
3,"Good for athletes, not so good for regular folks","This method looks good on surface but has only limited applications. Note that Maffetone used to train professional athletes, who are very competitive and beat themselves to death by training. If anything, they are in constant over-training state. So, backing off a little bit is very beneficial for their performance. However, if you are a regular person working in the office, this method will only bring extreme boredom and very little results. Unfortunately, Maffetone takes this one limited application and extends it to general population."
5,Love it,I have bought 2 of these and they are great! They look very good and can be either hung on the wall or placed on a table or shelf.
2,Poory constructed base,My husband purchased this item for his replica football helmet. The cover and mirror finish on the case is nice but the base is made of cheap plastic that cracks and bends.
5,Everything you are looking for in a casual/sporty shoe.,"I am buying 2 more pairs because I am afraid I will never find another pair of shoes that is everything I was looking for: style, color (although I wish there was white), comfort, convenience, and price. I wear a 6.5 and think they run a slight bigger - maybe because of the material and they are slip on shoes."
2,realy dissapointed,ok i just got this game a few weeks ago but it didnt take long for me to figure out this game stinks.All you do is walk aroundand kick enemes or whack them.The game has nothing to do with the movie after the robot chase.Overall this game is to basic.Dont even rent it.
1,Horrid Game!,This game is not fun at all. Don't waste your money buying it!It is a bad story and the brothers are very mean to each other.The controls are difficult and hard to get used to. I am very disappointed because it was so bad.
4,What a Help!,"While my child is too young to read this book on his own, I know it will be helpful for him in the future. As a parent of a child with sensory issues, I found that it helped enhance my understanding of his issues immensely (e.g, what HE is experiencing on a daily basis and how it might make him feel). The more insight and understanding a parent has on these issues, the better you can help your child. I highly recommend purchasing it."
4,Self Directed,"My 10 year old read this on his own and came up with questions about his concerns. It worked pretty well for him to get some self-awareness without it seeming to scream at him that he has a ""problem"". If you are lookign for an ah-hah moment for your child this works pretty well."
2,There is no joy,"I had great hopes for this CD but it sucks. Mr. Bostridge's singing of Handel is clinical, there is simply no joy, elegant sensuality or effortless exhuberance in delivery of these great Handelian standards. The singing is aggressive and mannered. Maybe he should have approached this music a bit more like the lieder repertoire he does so well."
5,ROD STEWART---A STAR,BUY AT LEAST ONE FOR YOURSELF AND FRIENDS OF EACH OF THE SONGBOOK SERIES..CAN'T HEAR ANY OF THEM TOO MANY TIMES IF ONE IS AN OLD CLASSICS LOVER
1,SHOCKING NOT THE REAL DEAL,"If you like cool jazz vocals that are athentic then please give this a miss...Its a jump on the current band wagon kinda release and lets make some more money. I saw him on the Parkinson show with Natalie Cole as one of the other guests Rod evan had the nerve to say in front of Ms Cole that he thought HE (ROD) had a great voice for jazz and it was really suited to this music, how embarrassing for him saying that in front of Natalie, as she is one who could lay claim to what he said but has the dignity and sheer talent that dosnt need to be bragged about. Natalie is TALENT end of storyReally go find the real deal jazz singers and stop making this terrible singer richer."
2,middle,"this is a nice cd. it is middle of the road boring. all songs chosen have been done to death. i heard mr. stewart remark that these are difficult songs to sing. No! there are so many interpretations that it's almost impossible for someone with such a good voice to completely suck it up. That being said, Rod the Mod has not put out a good album since the mid 70's. Let's not forget his work with the Faces, the fun-time Rolling Stones! Get the box set. Too bad really because his first couple of solo releases were sincere, beautiful singer/songwriter rock 'n' roll discs. That, unfortunately, went out the window big time. Total 180. Oh well."
1,The production is the shizzle!,"Hey Steve Tyrell Fans,Rod Stewart's new album, Stardust...The Great American Songbook: Volume III, produced by Steve Tyrell is now available at Amazon.com. Currently it is the number one best selling album on Amazon.com. Help Steve out for a job well done and leave a great review at Amazon. Feel free to mention Steve's name in your review if you liked the album!Sincerely,Ruth (biggest Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell fan on the planet) McCartneyPresident, Steve Tyrell Fan Club"
3,Steve Tyrell's Influence is Apparent,"Rod Stewart just cannot accomodate this music. His voice, as wonderful as it is, just does not inspire you lose yourself in the moment. Stardust would have been just another attempt to jump on the standards wave if it were not for the magical touch of the CD's producer, Steve Tyrell. Steve's influence and intimate understanding of the magic of this music is evident throughout. Tyrell ""gets it"" in a way that no other producer or performer does. When Steve performs, you ""feel the music and are lose yourself in it"" - over and over again. It is almost magical. But... I only listened to Stardust twice - each time - tuning out Rod's raspy voice and focusing on the beautiful arrangements and the enchanting Tyrell touch. I am a huge Rod Stewart fan, but Dear Rod, move me with ""Tonight's the Night"" and leave the Stardust melodies to Steve Tyrell."
2,Hogwash,"I have run out patience. Rod Stewart cannot sing the standards. It is awful. However if you want to see how an aging pop star handles standards, may I humbly refer you to Boz Scaggs ' But Beautiful'.The recording and performance are superb. He is growing old gracefully with attention to detail expressed in good diction. That fits in with the spirit and intent of the composer who wrote the great songs. They were meant to be sung and not growled at. Mr. Boz Scaggs sings them but Mr. Rod Stewart does not. Mr. Stewart would probably sell in millions whilst Mr. Scaggs would sell a few thousand. That is the unfairness of it all.If you like standards, please listen to ' But Beautiful'."
3,Try some new standards??,"I really loved volumes 1 & 2 but find myself feeling like Rod is leaving some of his magic out of the mix. Maybe it's time for a little change before it's too late?It's a long way from Maggie Mae to hear, but I wish Rod would inject some of the zazzz he used to infuse into his music."
3,Doesn't live up to Songbooks I & II,"I ran out to buy this CD upon release yesterday because I loved I & II. I listened twice, and this third installment seemed flat. New songs I suppose, but nothing special about the renditions. I'll give it a few more listens, maybe I'll warm up to this CD. I must say I was disappointed."
4,My Mom likes it.,My Mom has nearly every Rod album (and little else...except Joe Cocker). She likes this a lot. I think when people get old they are unable to Rock Out anymore.
4,Surprisingly good,"Rod Stewart is surprisingly good with his songs in in Stardust... The Great American Songbook, Vol. III.I liked it, and so will you."
3,"The Great American Songbook, Vol 111","I felt the choice of songs on this Cd did not do him any justice. Or maybe, as in the movies Stop after the 1st, maybe the 2nd is better(which in Rods case it was) But the 3rd, NOT! Two was his Best work"
4,Rod has done a fine job.,"I myself have never been a Rod Stewart fan, but have appreciated his persistence. I have to say, he has done a great job with his Songbook collection, and full marks to the musicians and orchestra - they are magnificent. The arrangements of these great songs work extremely well. A superb CD to have on whilst relaxing and taking it easy.Cheers Rod."
5,These songs will NEVER be outdated...,"To the reviewer, or anybody else for that matter, who seems to think it's the songs that are outdated, you can't be more wrong. Songs like these, especially ""Stardust"" and ""Embracable You"" are an eternal mark in American music. These songs will be 'in', whatever else may be passing for popular music at the time. Whether you may like how Rod treats them, that is debatable. But don't come down on the songs."
5,Extremely pleased!!,My mom had been looking for this cd for years!!! I started looking for it to give to her as a gift. It is pretty hard to find! Amazon was the only place I could get it! It is a great great cd. She LOVES Rod Stewart. She has been listening to it everyday since!!!:) very happy with it!
4,Made me Cry,I'm in my early 50's and was a Rod Stewart fan in my teens and early 20's when he was a big rock performer. Listening to his performance on this CD makes me want to check out the other two previous clssics series...I was impressed...not what I expected at all and I found myself just letting it play over and over through the day. What a Wonderful World is a song that I first heard when I was in Vietnam and it made me cry then...it still does today..tears are streaming down my face as I listen to Rod's version and remember so many heartbreaking experiences and the terrible grief that went with them.I like this Album.
4,Is Big Band sound on the way back??,"Rod doesn't have the greatest vocal range in the world nor does he always seem to be in tune yet he has that certain something - gravelly voice perhaps?? This is his third trip with 'The Great American Songbook' and he's doing very well with it. Highlights on this outing are 'Baby It's Cold Outside', a delightful duet with Dolly Parton and 'What A Wonderful World' which seems to fit his vocal talents. He's also assisted with the likes of Bette Midler, Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder. Great tunes and even greater orchestrations. Top notch album."
4,Very Good,This was almost as good as I and II but still wonderful to listen to all those standards done by Rod.
3,Do some guys have all the luck?,We love you Rod. Please remember your roots and why we loved you for so long. On this cd I only found three songs that I thought showcased the Rod I knew.....
1,Does he never learn,"Being on holliday in mallorca,and short of something to do, my friends and I played voll 3.This must be the biggest insult to the great american songbook in history.This man has no feeling or idea how to interpret a good song.Has he never listened to Mel Torme and the great singers of american standards.Having made his money murdering rock music,why inflict himself on good music.I despair.Phil Ramsden UK"
1,He Must be Stopped Now,"I thought he was bad when he covered Tom Waites Downtown Train but at least Tom got paid royalty's from it. He does not have the voice for these songs. I think i know why he started to do these lame standard albums because he and his record company got sick and tired of paying royalty's. They don't have to pay a dime to cover these songs. If you like these american standards they why not try out Chet Baker, MIchael Finestein , Frank Sinatra or something like Willie Nelsons Stardust if you want to here better versions of these classic songs.Rod has said that he will stop doing these cds so i thank you Rod for coming to your senses maybe on your next cd you should cover songs that not much people have heard of."
1,Is that a U.F.O.?,"In spite of this contrivance by Rod, I am still a fan of his rock and roll music. His uniquely sounding voice should have worked well with these old standards, and he almost pulls it off. However, it is somewhat like a 12 year old singing ""My Way"". No matter how well it is done, one can't help laughing at the absurdity of it all.One need only listen to Steve Tyrell singing the same tunes before using this Rod Stewart cd as a frisbee.Oh well, (...)."
2,"Rod, please stop. Please.","Rod, honey...I love ya, but you gotta stop. Surely a really good friend would tell you. I bought the first and third of your Songbook CD's cause you've done some mighty fine singing in the past (and you're still cute as the dickens), but this CD is pretty terrible. Your range is shot, you can't hold notes on key, you breath in the middle of words, and your raspiness has gone well beyond musical. You do have a way with phrasing, but it just doesn't make up for the rest. The only songs I could listen to twice (cause the badness makes me sad) are your two duets. Bette and Dolly made the duets worth a second listen. I'm going to put these two CD's away so I won't forget that you once could rock and sing. I did't feel right giving you just one star, but, sorry to say, I probably should have."
1,Another one?!,"Talk about milking it...One would think that mixing a great singer (Rod Stewart), with great songs (""Stardust""), would be an unbeatable combination. This is not the case here. Rod Stewart is a prototypical blues/rock singer, one whose voice seems to have aged well. Unfortunately, this does not automatically qualify him to sing these songs. These productions sound mechanical, bordering dangerously close to American Idol quality, with a hint of kareoke bar. You want to hear Rod Stewart at his peak? Listen to his early solo albums, or better yet, listen to him on Jeff Beck's first solo album, ""Truth."" His vocals are amazing. Meanwhile, Clive Davis might want to spend more time looking for new talent, instead of milking the classic rockers (Rod Stewart, Santana). And if baby boomers must listen to someone from the rock era singing standards, check out Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now."""
2,Another Very Dismal Effort to Re-Do the GreatOldStandards!,"If you need proof that the basic repertoire of the rock era is barely a no-show, listen to this! Yes, some of these aging rockers have finally realized there are hundreds of great timeless songs, written mainly before they were born! Compared to Tony, Frank, or Ella, it is best simply to refer to this concoction as insipid, and leave it at that. But this old goat can't even begin to match Old Blues Eyes, who leaves all the ex-rockers with their grade school efforts with these great classics in the dust!"
3,LACKS PASSION,"This is a good album, but not up to the standards of album 1. Rod does not have the same passion and enthusiasm as he showed in album 1. Are the Great American Songs getting boring for him?"
1,There ought to be a law...,"...against permitting Rod Stewart to desecrate the Great American Songbook. He has no voice left. (Did he ever have a voice?) He has no ability to vary his style. He has no syncopation, breath control or ability to play with the musical rhythms. There is only mediocrity here. It is testimony to the songs themselves that he can't quite seem to destroy them."
1,MORE DRIVEL FROM AGING OLD ROD,"Back in the early 70's Rod could really rock. Now he seems content to be a middle-of-the-road, ""lite rock singer."" He lost his respect among intelligent music listeners years ago when he recorded disco garbage like ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy,"" and ""Infatuation."" He's never really recovered. Some of his later ""hits"" were originally written and recorded by other artists such as Van Morrison's ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You"" or Tom Waits. Now he's trying to be Harry Connick, Jr. it it just doesn't work. Why females buy up this garbage is beyong my comprehension. I can't imagine any male buying this unless he has ""a little sugar in his britches,"" if you know what I mean."
3,Just not for me.,I'm glad some are enjoying these recordings. I have loved them from Harry Connick and Tony Bennett. Rod just doesn't do it for me.
1,The Sucker Record Buying Public,"I saw on TV when Rod was told his first ""songbook"" sold millions. He literally fell to the floor laughing. Why do you think they are cranking these things out every few months on you people? Rod is laughing at all of you all the way to the bank.It is a shame to see one of rocks greatest singers so joyously trashing and throwing away a once great career.It's even a bigger shame that so many people are so foolish to support it."
1,This is not jazz.,"I am a jazz musician and director who also gives private lessons, and this album is probably the worst I have ever encountered. Every high school jazz band I've heard has been better. Either it was entirely overdubbed or Rod Stewart and his rhythm section have no sense of jazz- probably both. The way in which he interprets the lyrics and melodies borders on cliché and often sounds amatuer. The background rhythms just drone on with no hint of enthusiam or anticipation, there is little to no interaction between the rhythm players and none between the rhythm section and Stewart himself. It is as if he recorded over a computer-generated background one afternoon, put a label on it, and made another fortune. Just because you perform in one musical genre doesn't mean that you can sing or play jazz- it has its own world of complexities. That goes for some of his guests as well.Verdict: this album is very dull and dry and the CD would be put to better use as a coaster."
1,"When Rod Is Good, He Is Very Very Good","And when he is bad he sings standards.Horrid. I'm a fan of all the songs on this disc, and I love Rod's classic recordings too, but the two go together like ketchup on ice cream.On some tracks he sounds disconcertingly feminine, like a huskier and less talented Dinah Washington. Anyone who wants to hear ""The Nightingale Sang In Barkley Square,"" get the classic live Mel Torme'/George Shearing CD. Perfection! This version is excrutiating.Most of the songs just sound dead, as if everyone involved is just going through the motions. Truly fit for an elevator, and you better hope it's a short ride!"
3,pleasant but not hot.,"after the previous standards cds this one didn't match up. connick, buble, cincotti, krall lead the way, sorry rod."
5,"Well, I loved it!","Apparently due to other reviews, this CD is not for everyone. But for me, I love hearing a familiar voice of my generation signing songs from my grandparents' generation that I learned to love as a child. I've listened to it nearly every day now since Christmas.I just think this is a fun CD."
1,What's the big deal?,"I don't understand the attraction of a washed up singer that refuses to quit by becoming even more unoriginal or an audience that finds it entertaining. If you want to hear Rod Stewart go back to the Faces box set or some of his vocals with Jeff Beck. You see music is timeless because it allows you to recapture the essence of an artist at their peak. Once great does not mean always great. The American Recordings crap by washed up Rod only supports this premise. Save your cash and buy any Patti Smith or Los Lobos album if you want to hear good music or you can buy this garbage, wallow in the mundane and vote republican. Get a life."
2,Stardust . . . or dusty star?,"My husband and I commend Rod for selecting Steve Tyrell as the producer of his new album, STARDUST. Steve did an amazing job not only in selecting the Standards for this album, but especially in maintaining the highest standards of professional quality for the musical arrangements resulting in a fine recording truly worthy of Steve's talent.We regret that we cannot give this album a higher rating. Rod comes across as a dusty star, one who was more successful, exciting, and alive as a master of rock in the world of Maggie Mae. Rod should leave the Standards to Steve Tyrell who sings them so much more passionately and convincingly.And, what is it with this selection of an ambiguously androgynous Stewart featured on the cover of the album?Marcel and Theresa Gagnon"
4,Rod Stewart continues to rock,"Since Rod Stewart has gone retro, I become an even big fan of his. In fact, when my husband and I were married last year, we walked down the aisle to his ""Time after Time"". I also like the duets he does."
3,Highs and lows,"Rod seems to not be able to hit the high notes without making it sound strained. His low notes sound a bit rusted..sort of gravelly and raw. However, this album is great for a Rod Stewart fan. It's always nice to hear a famous artist step out of his or her 'safe' zone. Very nice to sit back and close your eyes."
1,Rod Stewart The Great American Songbook,"Rod Stewart does not have the chops to make this music come alive! Late career, try something different to keep the money coming in, for early career success. Insignificant music! Dennis Michael Clark"
3,Okey dokey smokey,"This one is okay, but Volume 1 and 2 are much better. At any rate, long live Rod Stewart!!!!"
4,superb story telling in (what appears to be) a good translation,"An enjoyable read about 19th century Paris with lots of characters (don't even try to remember who is who without a written list... and it doesn't matter because they all end up sleeping with someone!). Evocative of place and period.Interesting to compare Zola with Balzac and Stendahl. Zola was considered salacious for a while, but now is back in good graces. Well worth a try if you enjoy these novels."
5,Great music,"It was great to see the movie, after listening to the tape since the 70's. The only criticism I have is regarding the quality of the film itself - the pictures and words are sometimes blurry. The translation at times is incorrect and unfortunately, the viewer misses out if he doesn't understand the Hebrew. Overall, it's a classic in Israeli film and is a delight to watch. I give it a 9plus."
1,Boring and Overrated,What can I say? I was bored listening to this CD. Nothing really stands out except for the sickeningly slick overproduced sound which clashes with his vocal style. Really a classic album for people more interested in the trappings of a clique than actual music. A soundtrack for Trustafarians.
3,I can't share everybody's enthusiam about this CD,"I'm sorry but I can't share everybody's enthusiasm on this CD, and I think it looks a bit overvalued. There are some good songs (""Excuse me MR"" is REALLY good) but on average it is not such a good CD. I think the melodies are not very original, although I like the way he plays. But, as you know, a good musician is not necessarily a good songwriter.. I would buy it only if you really like acoustic guitar and black music, because that is what he is, a good mix between black music and acoustic guitar playing. Frankly, I don't really understand all these fans who go crazy about him, but maybe I'm the one who's wrong..."
3,pretty good disc,i like some of his songs on this set as long as he isn't to preachy.i think his Guitar playing is the best thing that he does.i don't really dig his singing.i still feel there's a strong comparison with Lenny Kravitz.
5,%,This is very possibly my favorite Ben Harper album. His lyircs are astounding and the music is good too. I would swear he was crying on some of those tracks...
5,this album rocks da beef,"this album is awesome. it mixes slow songs like ""by my side"", ""another lonely day"", and ""please me like you want to"" with conga-based tracks like ""burn one down"" (nice mary jane song), ""excuse me mr."", and ""oppression"". this is an amazing album that every man, woman, and child should own. dig me? i knew that you could."
4,Must own this album!,"I am a fan of Ben Harpers. Have been since the '90's. I love his vision of music. His soulful vocals. The lyrics of this cd and the energy that went into it, make it my favorite all time of his albums. I even own his newer ones, they still do not compare. This is where it all started...."
5,Class of his Own,"Those who say they are Ben Harper fans after listen to such tracks as ""Steal Your Kisses"" and ""Faded"", fortunately don't know what they are missing. It is his earlier work including Welcome To The Cruel Worl and Fight For Your Mind, where Ben is truly in a class of his own. Fight For Your Mind is a flawless album, an album you can leave constantly playing and not get sick of. If you are only going to buy one Ben Harper album, it has to be this one."
2,eh...,"This may be his best album, but despite all the musical styles he dabbles in he doesn't seem to have come up with more than a somewhat competent pastiche of reggae, funk, soul, folk, etc. without adding a lot that's new. Every artist, without exception, draws on previous artists but the creativity is adding SOMETHING new or combining arts in different ways and I just don't hear it here."
5,It's a cd that never leaves my changer,"It's just so incredibly good. The cd just has a flow to it that so few cd's have. He's got some great things to say and he says them beautifully. I stronly recommend this cd first before you buy any others from him. Burn one down was the first song I heard from him, and that was all I needed."
1,It's bad beyond belief.,I'm not a very happy camper after buying this. This is sooo average that it's not even funny. It had not even a shred of redeeming quality to it. Paula was obviously washed up by the time she made this.
2,First Impression,"okay, to be honest I haven't heard the entire cd, but based on the songs that you can listen to on Amazon, this is not Paula's finest hour. ""Spellbound"" is without a doubt her crowning achievement."
5,A Must Have,"This album is fantastic; easily the best so far by Paula Abdul. About 90% of songs (here) are fast dance grooves like Crazy Cool, Ain't Never Gona Give You Up, Love Don't Come Easy, Under The Influence, and Sexy Thoughts. I also liked the calmer ""sweetheart"" ones like My Love Is For Real or Cry For Me."
1,dislike,"i'm not going to beat around the bush...i did not like this. all of the songs are bad. paula abdul may be able to dance alrite, but she cannot sing or write. her voice isn't the worst that i 've heard, but it's not the best either. for much more fun, i 'd recomend the new ricky martin tape. it really makes you want to move!"
1,The Choice is Yours...,"I guess my major problem with this cd was not it's suggestiveness, but rather it's in-your-face approach to controverisal issues. I am very open minded but I really don't need Paula's political views shoved down my throat when I listen to her music. Case and point being how the song ""The Choice is Yours"" is so obviously a pro-choice anthem. ""Under The Influence"" clearly makes an arguement for the repeal of DWI laws in the state of California. ""Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up"" is a vailed story about a substance abuser who has no intention of giving up their vice. ""Crazy Cool"" takes the serious issue of schizophrenia and makes a mockery out of it's symptoms. And last but not least is the tragic tale of an unloved transexual in ""If I Were Your Girl"". Again, I have no problem discussing issues such as these with people, but I am disappointed that I have to be bombarded with them while I listen to music."
5,The very best of Paula Abdul...,"I have to agree with a few of my fellow reviewers. This is the best Paula Abdul cd. It had a mix of styles and displayed a sense of maturity. ""My love is for real"" was the sexiest, most intelligent recording of Paula's career. The only reason this album failed was because Virgin records dropped the ball. She gave them 2 HUGE selling albums, a world tour and an unbelievable ability to market herself. With this album, they didn't even bother to hype its release or give it the push it needed. They just assumed it would hit big and they could save some money on marketing costs. And when it failed, they just wrote her off as a lost cause. Lets not forget when it came time to release a greatest hits album, they didnt even bother to put ""Spinning around"" on it. Which ironically, ended up being re-recorded by Kylie Minogue and hitting #1 all over the world. I guess Paula got the last laugh after all."
1,HATE,"THIS IS VERY VERY (ADD ABOUT 5,000 MORE ""VERY'S"") BAD. I HATE THE SONG ""AINT NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP."" I HATE ""CRY FOR ME."" COME TO THINK OF IT, I HATE ALL THE SONGS HERE.CORKY ST. CLAIRE"
1,Cry for ME!,tasteless...shameless...sleezy...trite... unappealing...vocally handicapped....(Does this sound like a good cd to you?)
1,SHUT UP (and dance),Maybe she can still get a job choreographing for Janet Jackson because this whole singing thing just isn't cutting it anymore. I could have told you right off the bat with Paula's first release that she would never amount to anything musically. This is her third cd if I am not mistaken and this is just getting out of hand. Save your money or better yet buy the Jennifer Lopez cd (which ROCKS!!!).
1,WHAT?!,"It's a pretty sad day when someone feels the need to stick up for a faded pop star and after reading ""Head Over Heels For Paula"" I knew I had to write. There is no excuss for taking a stand when tasteless dribble such as this is in question. In my opinion ""Hilariously Bad"" hit the nail on the head. These songs are all disposable at best and stomach-churning at their worst. ""Crazy Cool"" isn't exactly a ""bad"" song, but everything else on the cd easily falls into that category. Why waste your time?"
1,Where's the -32 star rating?,"I am quite angered that I must give this album even one star, which is at least 30 more than it deserves. If you like Jennifer Love Hewitt's music, you'll probably like this record. If you enjoy sticking sharp metal objects into your head, you may enjoy this record. If you enjoy listening to animals being tortured, this album is right up your alley. If, however, you have one ounce of sanity and you do not enjoy hurting yourself and other creatures, you'll want to avoid this album at all costs. Contained on this album are some of the worse sounds ever recorded. Ms. Abdul was never all that great in my book in the first place, but with this loathsome work she got caught in a downward spiral. I did not think that she could be any worse than her first two albums, but she proved me wrong. Do yourself a favor: go buy Urge Overkill's ""Saturation"" album instead. Buy ANYTHING else instead! Your world will be a much better place if you're not in possession of this hideous album."
3,Good 2 dance 2,I liked this one for dance. It wasnt much for being serious but thats OK. This one just has most dance and not much thought.
3,This is a O.K. album. Let me explain....,"I was a big Paula Abdul fan back in 1988 when I was almost 12 years old. Now I am 23 and still consider myself a big fan of hers. I love her Forever Your Girl, Shut Up and Dance, and Spellbound. I give all of them 5 stars but Head Over Heels was a disappointment. I do think that Paula expresses well, vocally, on this album. This album probably is the best example of how high and low her voice can get. Her voice is strong in this album and yes, I think there are a few catchy songs on this album, but over all, the gut that Paula Abdul displayed in her two previous albums, is not there. She is coming back, though. She has a new CD coming this year along with a ""Best of.."" CD so let's hope she has learned from her Head Over Heels (which went Gold, by the way)."
2,Missouri,"hello! My email Mates wanted me to hear this and to see what I thought of it. i had a hard time finding it but then my friend Jackie O had the tape of it so i can hear it now. I thought that it was a below averge overall. it had its moments, but there werent a ton of them. just to send out a glitter hello to Dale.. Sooz.. Kim.. and tommy-Boy. You are the greatest!"
2,not all that good,"This did not strike me as a good thing to buy. I wanted to find some good older types of songs,but after hearing it in a used music shop this music didn't seem as good as I wanted it to be. Not one of Paula Abdul's best works."
1,Pull the plug,"Yo, I have not heard many cds worse than this. Whatz up with her?! A fly girl she ain't! I'z gonna use this one as a frisbee."
1,Low Point,"I have just finished listening to a copy of this cd that my friend loaned me. As a fan of Paula Abdul I wanted so badly to like the songs, but there was no way I could. In all fairness this is not the worse cd I have ever heard (Neil Diamond's ""Lovescape"" would have to take the cake) but I dare someone to find a current cd with much less merit. I am not sure what image Paula Abdul is trying to come off with in this cd but it's a far cry from the innocence she showed in her first two cds. The lyrics are a bit too suggestive for my taste and with Paula Abdul's weak vocals on top of that she sounds like a trampy 8th grade brat. I guess if you like that type of thing you may enjoy this cd."
2,I give Paula Credit.,"I give Paula credit she did really try with this album. She tried to get in with the R&B audience of that 1995 era but it just didn't work. Unfortunatley to many of her fans recognized her as ""Forever Your Girl"" and failed to see past that. The album debuted at Number 18 and quickley fell from the charts. Her single ""My Love Is For Real"" Hit a Miserable 28, which I think should have been a top ten hit easy, and ""Crazy Cool"" Her last charted hit, hit 58. This album went Gold, Selling 500,000 copies but was a far cry from her two previous albums. I think Paula should release a new album, I think her fans are waiting and so am I! This album, not available anymore, unless used, is for the true fan and not worth the buy. buy the greatest hits instead."
1,"No ""Rush""...","i could have sworn this was the cd with ""Rush Rush"" on it when i purchased it. Imagine how disappointed i was that it's not on this cd. That is my all time favorite Paula Abdul song. Does anyone out there know what cd ""Rush Rush"" is on? I'll trade ya!:)"
5,Really cool,This album is really cool...its a shame it didnt get more promotion...die Virgin Records!
1,try acting,"i was just thinking how so many artists these days are now taking up acting. maybe this would be a good idea for paula since this cd is pretty not good. the only song that is good is that ""cry for me"" one. it makes me sad but i know exactly what she's singing about. i've been there girl!"
1,Hilariously Bad!,"If you want a good laugh check out this cd, otherwise don't waste yor time. Each song sounds like a rip-off of a different song done by a much more talented artist...example being how shamelessly similiar ""If I Were Your Girl"" is to Janet Jackson's ""If"". It's no wonder Paula Abdul never released another cd after this dreadful attempt at music! I could just go on and on...many of the songs take on a sexual overtone for no appearent reason other than to make sure the listener doesn't turn it off. ""Sexy Thoughts"" is a prime example. The song is nonsensical to the max with lyrics such as ""If you think you're sexy, clap your hands like you just don't care"". WHAT!!!??? bye bye Paula Abdul"
1,no No NO,"It was at the 37th listening that I finally figured out the problem here (actually it wasn't quite that long, but who's counting?). Amazon says to say why you didn't like something. Well it's because it's so bad. I mean this is some terrible stuff right here. Someone said that a new Paula Abdul greatest hits album is coming out, and I can guarantee that there won't be too many songs off this poor album on that. I hope she does well with that; a little while back I got the Debbie Gibson greatest hits and it was very good. I'm hoping to hear the GOOD Paula songs also, but not the ones on this album. No wonder it's not available anymore!"
1,Fairly poor,"Do yourself a favor and keep yourself from purchasing this. This has little to offer anyone who has taste in good music. If you are looking for some good Paula Abdul music, I would suggest that you invest in her first recording, ""Forever your Girl."" Even ""Spellbound"" it much much better than this. You can bet that if ""Head over Heels"" was any good, more music from Paula Abdul would have been released subsequent to this last gasp."
4,Paula Has Rhythm,"This is Paula's best album, in my opinion. First things first, her singing voice has improved a little upon 1991's ""Spellbound,"" she can give a deeper, more throaty sound at times. Also, she goes back to her dance/R&B roots, so you get plenty of upbeat cuts and lush ballads. ""Crazy Cool"" is the best one here, with a jazzy backing, loud and snappy chorus, and catchy lyrics. ""My Love Is For Real,"" the only moderate hit off the album, has a unique Medditeranian feel to it, with Arabian flutes and singer Ofra Haza doing background vocals (she sounds great). ""Under The Influence"" is rock-pop at its best, very catchy and almost trippy. I also like ""Love Don't Come Easy"", which has a Latin upbeat feel to it, ""Cry For Me"" the best ballad, and ""Ho Down"", a hip-hop lite track worth dancing to."
2,y?,Very weak music. Not much style. She did do good on that Campbell's soup commercial. I'm more into saguarro's myself.
1,Medicore Fun,"I don't think that anyone could honestly dispute the fact thatthis album is pure sleaze, but the songs themselves aren't that bad.Slamming grooves abound and sweet sugar-coated ballads bring out the best in Paula's limited vocal range. She will surely never gain the wide audience appeal that Taylor Dayne acheived but that's not exactly her fault. Perhaps if Paula returned to her true roots (which I refer to as ""funk-inspired-groovalicious-decadence"") she would regain some of the fans that this cd is bound to alienate."
1,this is not a book at all,"This is a very short pamphlet and not a book. It looks like it was mostly a public service/public information piece put out by Kappa Delta Pi, an honor society in education. It is really an outrage that Amazon.com sells it, and they charged over $4 for shipping an item that could easily have been placed in a #10 envelope and mailed with a single stamp. I plan to ask for a refund."
4,Why is everyone so hard on this game?,I'm 13 and loved this game but I'm stuck at the level wher u have to take down a bunch of wanted posters of daffy duck! I think what made me so attached to this game was the familiar characters. The graphics are amazing. i highly reccomend this game to anyone.
4,"Short, but good","But I'm at the Jungle Ruins cauldron challenge, the cooking toons. Jungle Ruins is the last. Warner Bros. Studios, Paris, Wooden Nickel, Area 52, and Jungle Ruins. But few hours, I'm where I am."
2,A FLATOUT BORING GAME.,"I nominate this game at number 5 at my top 5 worst gaming experiences. At first this game seems kind of fun, but then you realize: "" WOW THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CRAPTACULAR GAME !"" Every mission experience I went through was just as bad as the next, because of crappy, boring level designs, graphics, and gameplay, along with the acting. This another prime example of try before you buy. The other 4 games on my worst gaming experiences are: #1-Super Speedway(Atari), #2-Casper: Spirit Dimensions(PS2), #3-The Bible Game(PS2, Xbox, GBA), and #4 Gran Turismo 3(PS2). If it's one thing I'd rather do,it would be to let the kids I hope to have in the future play M-rated games than have them play such sh**ty games."
2,Fascinating subject but a difficult read,"I couldn't agree more that this is one of the most fascinating stories - sports or otherwise -that has been largely unheard. I'll read just about any book that involves horses, and the fact that this man was fighting such an uphill battle against racism, etc. makes him an incredible underdog. It's a great rags to riches story plus much more. My problem was the writing style. Maybe it's me, but I had a terrible time staying interested in the plot and keeping up with the cast of characters. It seemed to jump around mentioning various historical sidebars so often that it distracted from the essential story. I genuinely enjoyed learning the other historical information, but Seabiscuit was a much smoother read and included as much American history without needing a spoonful of sugar added to get it down."
2,"Good for Concrete and Masonry theory but not a ""how to"" book","This would be a good college text book for ""Concrete and Masonry Theory"". What I was looking for is a good text book for a ""How the Heck do I pour concrete and lay bricks?"" class. This weakly illustrated book with black and white photos was written by an architect and not a mason and is more suited to the general contractor or construction inspector. If you are looking for a hands-on ""how to"" book skip this one and buy a step by step well illustrated book with color photos."
5,Worth the Extra $$$$,Great mattress! Even after nearly five years and two kids it is in fantastic condition. It's worth it to pay a little more for quality.
5,"Ireland, My Ireland","Ireland, My Ireland.Una DempseyCounty Offally, Ireland(9/25/2003)Congratulations on the publication of Ireland, My Ireland. It is truly a gem; a most definitive account of Irish rural life in the earlier decades of the establishment of this state. I have no knowledge of any other book which gives such a rich account of midland Ireland as it was for the majority of people at that time."
4,Love triangle develops main character.,"Mary Whipple's review made some interesting points. I agree that the pacing is quick and the plot is not too terribly complex. I also agree that it is a ""lesson"" novel. However, I do think Millhauser intended the reader to sympathize with Dressler, and I felt he was successful in evoking this. The devise he used to do so was the love triange between Dressler, his wife, and her sister (with the mother popping in from time to time as well). We see different parts of Dressler's self unfold as he interacts with these characters. I identified with the inner conflict Dressler experienced as I read the book and really wanted him discover how to sort it all out. Millhauser was rooting for his character as well, I sense. He wanted him to win - not in the traditional way, but rather, he wanted him to transcend the immaturity of the race-to-the-top mentality. That's my opinion. (It has been about two years since I read the book, however.)"
4,Geotimes deals with all facits of Earth Science,"This magazine gives the latest news and articles on recent developments concerning the Earth sciences. The writing is aimed at the professional or the very interested amateur, but they are seldom ""jargony"". This is the place to go if you want to know why the earthquake in Haiti was so devastating or why the volcano in Iceland was explosive enough to disrupt European air traffic. There are usually articles on what's going on in Washington DC that affect the funding for USGS, or other science related organizations, as well as travelogues which focus on the geology of a region."
3,SEA OF PLAGUE IS FULL OF FILLER!,"SEA OF PLAGUE did what it was supposed to do, and that was to tie up loose ends in this particular storyline called: The Heart of the World.But along the way it was almost totally destroyed by filler all through the novel, telling all of us readers for the millionth time, all that went before. This only made the story slow to a halt and make me feel kinda ripped off. Why re-read over and over in each new novel the same info dumps again and again.Gold Eagle and the writer need to put the brakes on this formula immediately. If they feel the need to explain everything a million times, then put that filler info somewhere else, not in my ... paid book.Tell me a new story, not the same old rehash info in each and every novel!"
1,Jet Li: Fall of Honor,"This game is awful because it was way to short and easy. The best thing in the game is the graphics and you get to play the karate master, Jet Li. Fighting is really boring because its the same thing over and over again, punch,kick punch,kick punch,kick. It was a complete waste of time and if your going to make a karate game keep the guns out of it 'cause then you can just shoot people the whole game. The storyline was bad too. From reading this review i think everyone will agree with me that this game is a downgrade to Jet Li's stardom."
2,Hard not worth it,"I rented this game hearing it was but is awful. the controls r all with the analog and r and l buttons which is very stupid in hand 2 hand fighting, while gun fighting and sword fighting fun the controlls r still hard and the enemies is very and theres a diffculty level except u have to unlock on my opininon definately rent this game and dont buy it cause u get tired of it pretty soon"
2,As bad as his films!,"Jet Li has one good film, ""Fist of Legend"". Sadly, this game ignored that film and instead gave us the jet li that noone seems to be able to direct properly. li is a brilliant martial artist and is wasted due to poor direction. ""Rise to Honor"" is poorly directed. the controls are bizarrely set up and the dreadful ""stealth"" levels as well as the even worse shooting levels kill this game. the martial arts parts are excellent but very repetitive. i think that jet li should not have creative input on his projects. he should have the guys who did ""ratchet and clank"" do his next game!"
2,Boaring Without Much Control,"From the first appearance this game looks promising but fails to deliver as control of the character is weak. The game takes on the look of Matrix type effects and does in fact deliver that graphically. However Jet handles all of his moves on his own, all you do is tap the joystick to prompt his attack and movement. Not much fun from my perspective simply because there isn't anything really challenging here to learn. The strategy and game play are simple... hit and avoid being hit. That's it!?"
2,"easy at first, hard later","This game is fun the first time you play. At first, it's very easy. Then, the next thing you know, it's tricky. Some moves are hard to do and it doesn't have a tutorial or a practice mode to learn how to do moves or anything. I found that a little disappointing. One part was really hard and I could just not beat it and I got frustrated (A LOT). This game is for older kids and I am not going to play it for a LONG TIME seeing I can't get my money back or atleast enough to get something else."
4,Intense Cool Martial Arts Game,When you c the commercial for this game on T.V. it's like WHOA. This game has very cool martial arts and sweet stunts like Jet Lidoes:PROS:-Cool Graphichs-Sweet martial Arts ViolenceCONS:-Spacey controls-Spazzy CameraTHA LETTER GRADE: B+OVERALL: This game has cool martial arts and it's action-packed levels are amazing. Very kool!
4,It's real fun,"I rented this game and its fun, the moves are great and your grab moves are evn better. If you have seen the ad's for it you can tell it looks fun, how you can throw people on the barside and slide them down it's just all so cool............"
4,"Good,but not good enough","The controls are:R1:Is your main button{Block,Jump,etc.}.R2:When in the shooting levels,push the right analog stick forward and press R2 to shoot.L1:Is to 1:Dive in the shooting levels{When flashing only},2:Is to make time slow down{I think it makes you punch better.I almost got 20 hits}.L2:I dont know what it does.Okay with that done the reason I dont like this game is THE BOSSES ARE REALLY HARD and I'm a average player and sometimes when you want to punch you kick instead.Though when you dive it looks awesome and the graphics are great and his moves are really cool.One thing good is the Multidirection combos,which means you could punch and kick in all directions.You should would rent it first and see if you like it."
3,"Decent game,but TERRIBLE HARD CONTROLS!","This game has sort of a cheesy kinda feel to it.It sorta reminds me of a martial arts type of action b movie or something.The storyline is fair and the music is pretty good too.But the main problem that I have with this game,is the controls are awful! Plus they are also very hard.You walk around with the left analog stick and fight with the right one.It can get very tricky fighting like this,and your thumbs will get VERY sore quickly.This game also uses the top buttons of the controller as well.When I was playing this game,I was hoping that I could switch to using the face buttons to fight,instead of the right along stick,but I couldn't.Which really sucked.Overall,this is a fair martial arts action game,but if you're gonna play it,take breaks here and there,or your thumbs are gonna hurt like hell."
2,Kiddy game gets boring,It was a good game to begin with but gets very repititive very soon . played only like 24% of the game and now i will probably never play it again.
2,Not as accurate as I thought it would be,"I made a number of measurements on a flat highway, using a reflector held up by a friend of mine as a target. The distances varied from 100 feet to 300 feet, all of them additive to about 1/2 mile. I then measured the distance with a GPS in high-res mode and with a precision wheel. The laser range finder read too low by 200 feet out of 2,000. I have since stopped using it."
2,Fail.,"Ok, i rented omega stream because i was a syphon filter fan of 1-3, this one just disappointed me, The graphics almost compare with the first game,Gameplay is crap, Online just wont cut it, Mindless Shot em up game. If you are a playstaion gamer,I Recomend the older ones to this, 1.Save money 2.save time insted of wasting it on this.Overall, Sucked."
1,a let down,"I just finished wasting too many hours on this first - FIRST! - mission of this game, and I have to say that I'm quite disppointed so far. First, the storyline is all but incomprehensible. Second, why is this game even called Syphon Filter? It's nearly identical to Splinter Cell, just with less fluid controls.EDIT: This game is even worse than I originally thought. I think the dumbest thing they did was make the enemies respawn. I didn't bother to play past the second level."
4,Lighten Up! This game is cool,"Huge fan of the first two Syphon Filter series. (3rd was so-so)I bought a Jampack disk strictly for the Syphon Demo. The controls are a little different being on a PS2 now but same run and shoot fun. The only thing missing is the bad guys screaming when they fall off building after blowing off their kneecaps. Good clean fun, Janet Jackson. Hopefully, they put that back in the final version. Outside of that, if you loved the first two, this one tows the line nicely. And the graphics are better. Granted, this is only the demo but I played the thing 50 times.Buy it, have fun."
1,a very disappointed fan :(,"I'm one of Syphon Filter's biggest fans--I even love Syphon Filter 3, which was generally panned by critics. But SF: Omega Strain is a total letdown. I'm glad I only rented it instead of buying it. The game just doesn't play like a real Syphon Filter. It plays like a Syphon Filter knock-off.I knew something was wrong when the release date kept getting pushed back (it was supposed come out in Summer 2003, then October 2003, then February 2004 and finally May 2004---almost a year late). But still, I gave Omega Strain the benefit of the doubt---that is until I actually played it. I rented the Strain for five days, but I took it back after only two. I tried hard to like it, believe me I did. But its sh##. Step wide around this one, folks, and hold your nose."
2,Rent the game first,"This game is really hard. I haven't even gotten past the second level. You cant save during a mission which makes it hard to have fun when you need to play for 40 minutes to finish a mission. But if you can somehow reach the par times, then I guess it would be ok. The first mission's par time was 11 minutes. The first mission took me 45 minutes. I would rent it first, and decide if you like it. I really liked Syphon filter 1 and 2 but this is to hard. Maybe when you get further along and unlock more weapons, it gets more fun."
4,This isn't a true sf,"U don't get to be gabe at the begining of this game u r just some guy/girl u create. unlike sf 1,2 and 3 where u r gabe logan ( the main character in sf). u have to get far into the game to be gabe and gabe is the only reason i play sf because he is tyte and this game u r not gabe ( which realy suks )"
5,Awesome!,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It was entertaining to read about the life of my favorite cartoonists and one of the many people I would like to meet. I learned that some of the social troubles I am going through now in high school happened to Schulz in high school but he broke through that to be a successful man. This book helped me learn about him and get an ""A"" on my literature term paper."
4,Great Look at a Cartooning Icon,"First off, I am a Peanuts fanatic. My child's nursery has a My Little Snoopy theme, and, as a child, I wrote to Mr. Schulz and received a print of Snoopy, with his own ""pawprint"" autograph as my return gift.This book, which is the most comprehensive biography of Schulz I have found, is a gem for a fan like myself. For those who are just peripherally interested in Schulz, this book will probably be too detailed and discuss issues of no interest.However, for a fan like myself, hearing the true story of the ""Little Red Haired Girl"" and reading of Schulz's perceived failings in his life was very insightful."
4,Very informative reading,"It was a great book as far as decorating ideas and ideas regarding purchasing a fixer-upper, but I just thought that it would have had a few more details in there. It gave a very broad view of all the aspects of real estate investing, and is a great starter book. You'll definitely have to do a little research on your own to get the full gist of the business."
5,REALLY!!?? I can do it too........,"I had heard about investing in fixer-uppers but never thought that I could do it too. Doghouse to Dollhouse for Dollars was recommended to me and let me tell you ..... I could barely put it down. Jeanette not only gave me all the information from getting my credit on track to the act of fixing the house but the way she even wrote the book. The way information was concise, not too wordy, well organized, even the typeface used made it easy to look at and flow. She had me ready to jump out of my chair and get started before I had even finished the first chapter. Now I believe I can begin investing and securing my future in a market that is reliable. There is still alot of hardwork I have to put into it but I know I won't give up because of confusion and frustration of figuring it out all on my own. Thank you Jeanette for sharing your lessons and invaluable time so that I can have a 30 year jump start and be successful at something I have no experience at!"
4,Practical No Frills or Fluff Guide,"I bought a foreclosed,run-down property to rent out, in a working class, declining neighborhood and ended up with a terrible case of buyer's remorse. Then I found this book which stepped me through the process of transforming my ""doghouse to a dollhouse"". I used the practical tips in the book to get my kitchen to gleam and sparkle and to create a spa bathroom- all on a budget. I learned to get building materials such as tile and lighting for 1/2 price without a contractor's license. People were fighting to get into the property. I took before and after photographs for marketing the property on-line using tips and wording from the book, to get a strong appraisal and to refinance the property. The value of the property increased by $45,000 dollars."
4,Doghouse to Dollhouse,I really enjoyed reading this book it was a very easy read. I read most of it when I received the book. It is simple and easy to apply. Author has suggestions and pictures that illustrate what she wants to say. It has several example of how her family achieved success with simple renovation and paint.A lot of the suggestion are easy to apply.
3,"Some good ideas, some ""no brainers""","Easy to read. Some redundancy. Book could be 1/3 the size with no loss of info. Better nuts and bolts specifics would make it more useful. Overall, OK, but would look for other books before buying this as ""your guide"" to flipping for profit."
5,very good,"I'm absolutely satisfied with this product. I come from Germany and there this highchair won the tests in childs highchairs. Thatswhy I had a stokke chair in Germany for my both childs. Now I live in America and I bought this chair again, because of the high quality, the practicability and not least the good looking. The only bad thing about it is the high price. I love this chair and my childs do it too."
1,"The idea is good, but the product is dangerous","This chair is dangerous.Sure, your kids are able to sit with you at the table. But there is nothing to prevent this chair from falling sideways or backwards. If your child bounces up and down, or pushes to turn around, or uses the table as leverage to push backwards or sideways, forget it, he's going down and the chair will slam into him. Both my kids have been injured with this chair, one of them quite seriously (ER trip, head injury).Bottom line: Stick with the ugly plastic Peg Peregos, they're far safer due to the broader base."
1,Same Re-record set: Three Times Running,"This very same set of re-do's that was put out in 1998, 2003, & 2005. I have these and they are all uniformly poor and the same. Watch for titles like: UK No1. Hits Of The Sixties or UK No1 Hits Of The Sixties or UK No1. Hits Of The 60s or UK No1 Hits Of The 60s. They change the artwork slightly but be warned.Bad mojo check: just walk away."
5,Great Title! Great book!,"What I find with this book, as with all of Walston's books, is that he makes it thoroughly understandable. This book has cleared up so many confusing issues for me with such Biblical clarity that I can hardly understand how I didn't see it before. The section on understanding the word ""fornication"" was superb. The chapter on Spousal Abuse should be required reading for every pastor and counselor."
5,AWSOME !,"I loved this book so much. I'm a huge fan of Kevin and love his work. This book was 2nd best. The Road of The Dead being first. I highly recomend both, and wish there was a 2nd book to Candy."
3,engrossing...just a little bit not believable,"candy is a very engrossing novel full of intrigue...the characters are interesting but a little underdevelopled...the language is also at times a little clunky in that it is out of character or just not the way a character of that age would speak...in theater there is a something called the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" it is basically the audience's willingness to go along with the plot of the characters on stage no matter how far-fetched it may seem...the audience allows themselves to feel for the characters for however long they are watching the show...well with this book i felt it was difficult at points to be able to believe what was going on because of the underdevelopement of the characters...i didn't know them well enough to feel much about them...i only felt for them when they where in dire situations."
3,okay,"The book ""candy"" is an okay book. It tells the story of a boy with everything going for him who meets a girl named candy and falls in love with her. What I liked about the book is that it doesn't potray drugs as just something you can use and then get off just like that. It shows that drugs aren't just a fun past time. That they aren't something that one uses when you are bored or to liven up a party. It shows the reality of drug abuse. It has a really intense withdrawl scene that was really well done. What I didn't like was Joe's intense fascination with Candy. He meets the girl about twice before he falls in ""love"" with her. Joe's character is not a realistic teen. A normal teen who would've discovered Candy's secret wouldn't have gotten so involved but rather would've just left Candy to deal with her own issue."
4,Loved this novel!,"One ordinary day, a kid named Joe takes a train to London and get lost around the city's station...and meets Candy.Candy is the girl who takes average Joe out of his safe, comfortable world. As Joe stumbles into Candy's life of drugs, prostitution, and violence, he becomes more and more drawn in until he can't think of nothing but her. Soon Candy's problems become Joe's problems and their lives become both at stake.This was a completely captivating novel, but I kind of wanted to know more about what happened in the end. However, overall it was well-written and I do recommend it."
1,Stupid Ending!!!,This is my first review. I usually dont care to write these but i just finished this book and let me tell you i was not impressed. First of all i was bored the whole time. The only reason i finished it was because i have this thing about having to finish ever book i start. but the whole thing was stupid and boring. the ending was okay but even then i was only into it for about 5 pages then i was bored again. and the ending. wtf. it sucked super bad. no one read this book. trust me i am saving your time.
3,Wrong title?,"Overall, a pretty good book. But based on the contents the title should probably be ""trueSpace Plugins"". The techniques described for using plugins are very good, however, some of the plugins in the CD are demos (crippled functionality). This was somewhat confusing since it does not agree with the steps indicated in the book. For example, chapter 6 discusses how to use a particular plugin, however, the plugin on the CD is a demo copy. Therefore, the steps outlined in the book do not agree with the contents of the CD. Other than this, the information was helpful in determining what plugins are useful for what effects."
3,"Dated, but Useful","Considering the chronic lack of commercially published trueSpace materials, this book could be seen as a welcome enough (if slightly dated) supplement to Frank Rivera's Inside trueSpace 4. You might however want to purchase Frank's book before getting this one."
2,weak at best,"Add me to the list of the very disappointed. The subject matter is very limited in that it's basically a walk-through of different plugins. Not very many color plates (a must for a computer graphics book, at least for me). The black and white pictures on the normal pages are pretty bad. Maybe it's the writing style, or maybe it's me, but I just could not follow a single chapter. On this type of book, you want to be able to open it anywhere, start reading and learn something interesting; no such luck here.If you want to spend fifty dollars on a truespace book, buy ""inside truespace 4"" which essentially covers this material and way, way, way better."
2,Truespace Knowledge ?,"This quote from the authors web site says it all.""...no longer supports any product that may be affiliated, in any way, with Caligari's trueSpace product, or any of their other products."""
4,"There is light at the ""Dark End...""","Dark is right: ""Dark End of the Street"" has to be the moodiest, most reflective disc Barbara Dickson has cut. That's not to say it's a downer; however, don't put this on expecting to liven up an evening. Even ""The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face"" is delivered as thoroughly unsentimental, with a spare, modest backing. Other tracks include the winsome ""Who Knows Where the Tiime Goes,"" as well as ""Sandman's Coming"" (a song about a dying child) and ""Young Man Cut Down in His Prime,"" a moving lament about an AIDS victim. Told you it wasn't a party album! Still, there are few vocalists as warm-sounding as Barbara Dickson -- her voice is absolutely gorgeous, and she sings everything with grace and intelligence. Her version of Jackson Browne's ""Love Needs a Heart"" is simply amazing, with a bluesy horn section giving the song a gritty Memphis feel. Check this one out."
5,A must read book if you are unsatify with your job.,"This review is long overdue. This book will transform you and open up your world to a wider vision, expand your perception and worldview. Whether you are climbing a corporatate ladder or you are planning to or have dropped out of the corporate world and working on fulfilling your own dream. A powerful and painless way to learn systems concepts. Learn how to spiritually fulfilling worklife and personal life. Easy to read with story telling concept."
2,Too philosophical and ethereal,"I found this book to be too loaded down with philosophy and musings and not practical enough to be useful. The writing style reminds one more of a book of poetry than of a book on organizational structure and design. If one wants to read a book on how to succeed within various organizations and how to understand office politics, I recommend Kelly's ""How to Be a Star at Work,"" Taub's ""Work Smart"" and even ""The Idiot's Guide to Office Politics."" I did not find what I was looking for in this tome and was very disappointed."
3,Holistic approach to discovering freedom at work. Could lead to freedom from work if practiced to logical extreme,"I think this is really a type of meditation book on discovering how to maintain freedom in a work culture. The author has many different types of experiences and was able to figure out an interesting approach. At first, I couldn't get into this book, but later enjoyed it once I accepted it didn't use an expected analytical method. Using these principles and thought processes, work culture is more tolerable mainly because it's far easier to reject it outright."
4,Very good BUT,I like the rack but the way it is made its hard to find a place to put tie down bungies.
5,"Jeez, Arcade Fire and Spike Jonz, what's not to like?","Loved it, though it's 30 minute format left lot's of loose ends and ""WTF's""? Very cool watch. More, please : )"
4,"Fine book, CD version is limp!","Like Minasi's ""Mastering 2000..."" book, this one is an enjoyable read, very instructive and very complete. Unfortunately, the CD version here has the same fatal flaw as the ""Mastering 2000"" version: the PDF cannot be annotated or highlighted.I know what you're saying: ""But I have a photographic memory and can remember where the really good stuff is on any of this book's 1616 pages."" You'd better.Seriously, Minasi must have grasped this defect and pointed it out to SYBEX. Hopefully, they fix it before Minasi writes the next one. I got my copy for free, otherwise I'd have bought it used, refusing to reward SYBEX with another sale in the primary marketplace."
2,Where's the Meat at?,"Truly a disappointment! I'm new to Server 2003, but far from new to computers & windows. Theories, history, the evolution of networking ... none of which I cared about! Just show me step by step how use Server 2003. How do you add users, computers, setup domains ... the basics, so I thought. Don't waste your money."
2,"Decent, but not great like the older Mastering Guides","The older guides were better. This one wasnt great, but it was better than the Dummies guide which was pure junk. This book because of its enormous size and lack of flow really just kills you, but its pretty good if you want to nail down Windows Server 2003, IF you can keep the book in your hands long enough to digest it. Its just too long and drawn out. So far though, out of the 4 books I read, this one is rated number 2. Dummies, was last. Next up, I am reading the Delta guide and will post on that in a month. Hope this helps."
2,Very difficult to follow,"Completely disappointed. I honestly don't understand what the raves are for this book. The chapters are dense, it's very difficult to follow, and try to find something when you need it I dare you. It's like Minasi doesn't know how to articulate himself. I found myself wishing he'd get to the point. And what's with all the coverage of Windows for Workgroups and other archaic OSes. Does anyone use Windows for Workgroups?"
1,The worst computer book I've read in the past 5 years.,"I thought the author was a good one. But this book really destroys his fame.Simply put, the book is targeted toward kindergarden kids. You cannot learn much from reading it.I wasted my time and i don't want you to do the same thing; don't buy it."
1,get to the point.....,"I have 7 certifications thru Microsoft including MCSA and MCSE. Needless to say I have had to read a lot in the past. While this book does have a lot of information on Server 2003 it lacks SUS information which you can find in the MS Press book for 070-290. The author also continually tries to entertain you with his attempts at wit and humor. (Apparently he learned computer science thru the Dummy Series books, remember those?) Excuse me, but if I want to be entertained I'll buy a joke book, thank you very much. The purpose in buying networking books for me is to learn computer networking not to have to continually muddle through poor attempts at humor to hopefully find useful information. The MS books may be considered by many to be dry, but at least they are clear, concise, and stick to the point, that being networking technology. The book is a complete waste of money."
3,Hope it is good...eBook is disappointment,"I spend too much money on technical books so I try to find books with the included eBook so that I can read the book anywhere (including my PDA), anytime and not pack the HUGE books around. This eBook will not work without the CD so I can't use the book on my PDA. I don't share the books or CDs with others but I do like to have the reference material at home, laptop and at work. I will take this into consideration for future book purchases."
4,2003 Server - the easy way,"OK, I have just finished Minasi's book this evening.I must say, after reading some of the negative reviews I really do not think that those people could have even read this book. It seems to be some kind of ""personal attack"" with no ground for the comments.The book seems to me to be very informative, witty and ideal for network administrators everywhere.Hope this helps someone make the right choice."
4,Timely,"This book is a great read. Don't be put off by the 1600+ pages. It is well written and contains many a light hearted moment to keep you going. There are loads of screen shots through the book, and while there are a few typos, it is usually easy to figure out what the actual words should be."
5,Great technical read,"After buying this book, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the thourough examples and Mark's conversational style of writing. As a consultant, more times than not, I need to understand the technology, not just download the Microsoft HOWTO from the support web site. Mark gives you reason behind the decision to make a mouse click not just click here and here and now you have a split-brain DNS. I like this so called ""fluff"" and the points in the book where he says, ""I used to do it this way but here is the problem, so now I do it this other way."" If you need concise, try MSDN documentation, if you want to know and understand the difference between DNS stub zones, conditional forwarding and when you could use each, try this book."
5,Mastering Windows Server 2003,This is an excellent reference for anyone working with Windows Server 2003 whether a novice or an expert. It is very well written and an excellent resource to have in your library.
3,Shrug,"I've read all the other Elm Creek novels, and so I'm sorry to say about 75% of the material in the novel is recycled (sometimes word for word) from the other books. The ""new"" 25% was charming, but I'm having a hard time feeling like it was worth spending $18.95 on a book I've already mostly read. Chiaverini's writing has definitely matured beautifully since ""The Quilter's Apprentice"" and it was neat to see the character Sylvia Compson's story woven together in one book, unifying parts that were scattered throughout the series. But I didn't enjoy reading it as much as most of the other books, since there were no real surprises or unusual points in the plot.For the person who said he wouldn't try anything else by the author, I'd ask him to reconsider and read Chiaverini's ""The Quilter's Legacy"" or ""The Runaway Quilt""."
2,Disappointed,I have enjoyed this series of book. The Christmas Quilt was a rehash of a lot of other stories and just did not hang together. It was disjointed and disappointing.
2,Disappointment,"The Sugar Camp Quilt and the Christmas Quilt disappoint because they are two back to back novels that rehash other books. The Runaway Quilt did a sufficient job with the Underground Railroad. Infact why couldn't the story of Dorothea Granger and Tom Nelson have been incorporated in the first book? Honestly, as much as I like Jennifer Chiaverini's writing I was very disappointed in this short book. Then to my surprise she does it again!! The Christmas Quilt rehash's the first book.This one was less forgivable because we have come so far with the characters by this time that this book became redundant. The little new that the reader learns was hardly worth the cost of this book. Shame on you Jennifer! If you can't do better than this please wind up the series, but don't subject us to the same old story from a different point of view unless you can do that in the same book."
4,Need to get in the Holiday Spirit? Read this book.,"I always try to read a holiday novel in November to help psych me up for Christmas. I had heard of this series before but had not read any of the other novels. I wondered if I would understand the book without any other background information. It wasn't a problem at all. This book can definitely stand on its own. The author was great at combining mystery, historical fiction, family drama and accurate quilting details into a heartwarming novel that is quick to read. It will leave you feeling thankful for your family and family traditions and maybe spur you into starting some new traditions. Now to order the other books from this series and start from the beginning..."
3,The Christmas Quilt as reviewed in monsoon season,"This is the second consequetive Elm Creek Quilt Novel that takes place mostly in the past. Perhaps the author's intention was to write a nice, kind of old-fashioned Christmas story. Instead I found this a retrospective of Sylvia's memories that have been covered in detail in other of the Elm Creek books. Although the author has not lost her character development, descriptive, and other writing skills, I hope that in her next book - already published, but one I've not yet purchased or read - she will return to the present and tell all fans of this series, some more about what's happening in today's world with the quilters we've come to know and care about."
3,Disappointed in book,"As a follower of the series, I was disappointed in the content of this book, and was glad that I had borrowed it from the public library rather than purchasing it myself. It seemed as though perhaps Chiaverini wrote the book in earlier years and it was released at a later time. Not all of the information about some of the characters seemed current. I gave it three stars instead of only two because a new reader would probably enjoy it more. I hope her new book due for release this Spring will have more to offer to her long-time followers."
4,"Good, but not as good as her others","I've read all of the Elm Creek Quilts series so far, and this is the one I've liked the least. I'm used to Jennifer Chiaverini intertwining her characters, but in the Christmas Quilt she focuses more on Sylvia and Sarah, and Sylvia's past.Not as interesting as usual, but still, a good read."
4,Christmas gift to series fans,"Sylvia Bergstrom Compson is hoping for a quiet Christmas by herself, but her friend Sarah McClure has other ideas. She wants to go all out and recapture some of the old traditions which the Bergstrom family began at Elm Creek Manor. Sarah talks Sylvia into bringing out some old Christmas decorations and in doing so, she also brings out many memories associated with Christmases of the past. Some of the memories are painful, but as Sylvia thinks back to scenes of her youth, she begins to feel a spirit of reconciliation with people and situations in her past. Because of the peace she feels, she encourages Sarah to work on reconciling with her estranged mother. The vignettes in this short book serve to fill in some gaps from earlier books in the series and illustrate the parallels between constructing a quilt and building relationships with members of your family. This is a lovely book which Chiaverini fans will enjoy."
5,Christmas Quilt,The first Elm Creek Quilt book I read was the Runaway Quilt. I was hooked and had to go back and start at the beginning with Quilter's Appentice. I don't quilt myself but have found these stories really great. Following the life of the Bergstrom family and how they made a life in Pennsylvania is probably the story of many people who immigrated to this country and built a whole new life raising a family and creating a business. They lived through wars and depression good times and bad and as a family stuck together for many generations. These are the stories of that family and how it becomes reconnected after years of estrangement. I have recommended these books to all the quilters I know and even one or two that I don't know. Even if you don't quilt these stories are great. They kind of make you feel warm and fuzzy all over.
4,Recollections of the past,"How many times have you found yourself thinking about past Christmases? I assure you, you are being dishonest if you say you do not or have not done such a thing. This book did just that ... it allowed Sylvia to recollect the memories of her past, and in turn, those memories gave her ""present"" meaning and substance.I enjoyed recieving a recap to the characters of the past books, but greatly missed Andrew as her husband. However, getting to know the ""little boy"" aspect of Andrew was a treat!I thouroughly loved the last lines of the book!! Kind of brought everything together!"
3,Boring,"This is the first one of the Elm Creek Quilts novels that I thought was extremely boring. However, I feel that it is a must read to explain alot about the characters in the series. I don't think you will be disappointed, just bored a bit."
3,"The Christmas Quilt, nothing really new","I love the Elm Creek series and have read all of them. This one left me feeling like I just saw a re-run on TV. It is set in the same period as the very first book with much of the same rehashing of Sylvia's past. A nice little read, but don't look for anything special in this one."
5,Great kids poncho!,Ordered this poncho for my 7 yo son for our trip to Niagara Falls. It worked great! Kept him dry and was the perfect size with room to grow. Great quality and lightweight. Highly recommend!
5,Can't get enough,"This by far is the best basketball game ever made. I have not been this pleased with a game since the NBA 2K came out for dreamcast. Graphics, gameplay, sound, this game has it all. If you are a hardcore sports gamer and basketball fan then this game has it all. The only draw back to the game is the lack of user stats, and stats overall. Aside from that this game has it all. This game makes the Xbox 360 worth having. The money I spent on the 360 is well spent because of this game."
5,awesome game,"This game is great fun and addictive. Best basketball game I've ever played by far. Soundtrack is cool. Street mode is alot of fun. All they need is some minor improvement to the presentation, but overall the game is terrific and I would highly recommend it."
1,Wow! I can't believe that company's are allowed to get away with things like this.,"This is a good game, from what I can see of it. I haven't got to do much playing. It freezes shortly after tip-off. I have not completed one game without if freezing.The graphics are great, the sound is incredible, but mine just doesn't work. I exchanged it for a new one and it doesn't work either. I thought it might be my xbox 360, but it is fine. Nothing freezes on it but the 2K games. So if you can get a copy that works, have fun. Oh yea, don't bother calling 2K customer service about the issue. They were rather rude and they kept trying to send me to Microsoft.If it worked I would probably give this game a 4 or a 5. I can't possibly rate the product in whole anything above a one."
3,Nice Effort---Now Can You Clean Up The Real NBA?,"My real problem isn't with this game, but with the NBA itself. I just can't get into it anymore. I feel like I'm playing ""Roundball Gangwars"" or something.However this game is beautiful, the controls are nice, and there's a nice little career mode that starts you out playing streetball and practicing between matches with the points you earn. This was a great idea, but it takes an insane amount of time to get a player even slightly skilled.The ""drive controls"" could use a little work, you seem to lose control of your player when taking it to the hoop.Overall it's an alright game. If you're a fan of the TBA (Thug Basketball Association) then dive right in, you'll love it. If you're a slight enthusiast, like myself, then I don't really know if you should even bother.The graphics are gorgeous and seeing this only makes me weep, thinking of what ESPN FOOTBALL 2K6 would've looked like on the Xbox 360...Burn in nerd hell, EA Games...."
3,Decent game... Bought it for the easy Achievments,"I normally don't play sports games... they simply bore me to death. But a friend recommended NBA2K6 for some easy Achievements so I figured why not. And man are the achievements easy! Turn off the annoying announcers, set all your team settings to max (minus injuries) and the the CPU's to min, double the speed, pick a West Super Star team and 12minutes later 1000points. What I wasn't expecting was to actually have fun doing it, with the settings skewed so far in your favor the game takes on a goofy Globe Trotters vs. the local grade school team for the biggest one sided game ever seen.At two dollars an hour it gave four great hours of laugh out loud antics that I never intended on playing."
5,Create your own team,"Everybody knows one feature in their mind: Creating your own team. I did make two of them. One was for Austin, Texas and another city. People need to think about before giving me some feedback on this game. BTW, NBA 2K6 ROCKS 4 LIFE!!!!"
4,Great fun -- Love to see it on DVD,"I'm sure I saw this on TV in October of 1979, although many references put it at 1980. It's a fun, imaginative retelling of the classic tale -- not too scary for kids, not too corny for adults, but not to be taken seriously!My only complaint is that the countryside is covered in deep snow -- which breaks the connection with Halloween. Even back then New York state wouldn't be deep in snow in October.Sooner or later my VHS is going to give out. I'd love to have this on DVD!"
1,Poor delivery/return process,"I wish I COULD review this product - but I CAN'T because it arrived from your ""fulfiller"" SO DAMAGED it can't be used - and with NO return labels or recourse - and attempts to send it back to you for resolution only to find it coming back to me! C'mon, you can do better than this, can't you?"
3,Needs to be released as a DVD,I purchased this video last year and the VHS sound quality is awful and the picture quality was not much better. I really like the story with Jeff Goldblum and hope they release a DVD version before Halloween.
1,Didn't work with an OSTAR equipped 2001 Eldorado,Bought this to replace the original radio system with a digital/satellite/gps system. Thought it would be an easy install based on the apparent specific function of the interface module. Then the nightmare started. Took two different installers and an extra $600.00 to finally get it done right. Can't recommend the project for other Cadillac owners with the OLD analog ONSTAR.
1,Stay away from this product,"I cannot believe that I fell for the hype that describes ""Garden Composer 2004"". It is unbelievably awkward to use, e.g. try to draw a pool, or a connecting brick wall, etc. The encyclopedia is practically useless... I would think that I might choose the state that I live in and, maybe even the area of that state and the encyclopedia would show only those plants that would flourish in that area, but no, the encyclopedia shows just about every plant that grows on the planet.. and not very many at that. The advertised number of entries in the encyclopedia is 'over 15000'... actually I beleive there are slightly over 5000.Very very bad... and who wants a car described in a landscape plan?"
2,Las 30 bandas Del Siglo,I thought it was going to be a lot better. I grew up listening to banda and it was disappointing to not hear some of the better songs from that era. I liked about 5 songs on all 3 cd's. Not a good buy
4,"4 stars for the album. 5 stars for ""The Resurrection""","I personally love this album. It, like so many others have said, is very different than Kravitz' other music. It is very dark and gloomy, with the exception of a few songs. Lenny really dug down deep into his religious side on this one. All that not to say that the sad, gloomy songs are bad. They are actually really good for the most part. Also, I believe that this album has the best song Lenny ever wrote; the extremely Zeppelin-esque ""The Resurrection."" This song alone is almost worth the price of the cd.In short, if you are looking for the poppy, radio-friendly sound that you hear on Kravitz' other albums, you won't find much of that on this inconsistent album. And remember, that inconsistency isn't necessarily a bad thing."
3,The Circus Was Never Like This,"I had very high hopes for this album before I bought it. I was very excited after Are You Gonna Go My Way and was looking forward to Circus. I fell in Love with Rock And Roll Is Dead. I liked the title track as well. But the middle 6 or 7 tracks left much to be desired. The Last 2 tracks (In My Life Today and The Resurrection) blew my mind. He blends his spiritual beliefs with his masterful knowledge of lyrics and musical themes so well it almost brought a tear to my eye the first time. Non Kravitz fans may not like this album because it is not the trademark signature Kravitz of Let Love Rule or Are You Gonna Go My Way. This is a nice album, don't get me wrong, but if you're not a serious fan, don't expect to be wowed."
3,Sad Circus,"After the major success of Are You Gonna Go My Way, Lenny Kravitz should have been on top of the world. Instead, his world was crumbling around him. His marriage to Lisa Bonet was crumbling away and his beloved mother, Roxie Roker, was seriously ill. Circus takes on a dark tone throughout the album. The album opens up with the ominous ""Rock & Roll Is Dead"" and other dark tales like ""Don't Go & Put A Bullet In Your Head"", ""Thin Ice"", ""Tunnel Vision"" and ""Can't Get You Off My Mind"" permeate the album. Also, faced with his mother's sickness, he searches for spiritual answers in songs like ""God Is Love"", ""Resurrection"", ""Beyond The 7th Sky"" and ""In My Life Today"". Mr. Kravitz's heart doesn't seem to be in this album and sags from time to time. still the album became his first top ten album debuting and peaking at number ten."
5,Brightens up my life,"In my opinion from what I have heard of Lenny Kravitz, 'Circus' tops the list of his best albums. Lenny Kravitz expresses his true religous beliefs through many of the songs such as 'God is Love', 'In My Life Today' and 'The Ressurection' for which Lenny gains my respect. But not only is this album religious it is filled with the best damn sounds you will ever hear. With songs such as 'Tunnel Vision' and 'Rock and Roll is Dead' you won't be able to stop playing this CD. But it today!"
5,great,great deal i really needed this one for my collection it came in great condition and i was happy to add it
4,unique and different,"the best songs of this great album are: ""rock and roll is dead"",(an excellent song to start this record)""circus""(great voice,great lyrics,great music),""can't get you off of my mind""(go on you can cry),""magdalene""(for those girls who dream to be a tv star check this out first),""in my life today""(smooth ,excellent track) ""the resurection""(very religious song). it is clear that lenny is one of the best rock players in the entire world!!!! something very funny about lenny""s records is that you always like about 8 or 9 tracks of them,not only one or two like a lot of records.....simply the best."
2,Average after the High of Are You Gonna Go My Way,"This Album Lacks The depth&Joy of Are You Gonna Go My Way.This Disc is a Let Down.God Is Love,Don't Go& Put A Bullet In Your Head are the cuts.Can't Get You Off My Mind was A Good Cut as well.I Dug The Lyrics to Rock And Roll is Dead but The Music wasn't Happening.The Rest Of This Disc was Sad Filler.He Sounds UNINSPIRED Thru Out.However this is Usually the case after coming out with a Banging Album then come back with a so-so to Below Average Album."
1,"I hope you enjoy ""Swiss Family Robinson"" because it's the only DVD this one will play.","BEWARE. Sony has managed to manufacture a DVD player that will not play DVDs. Of the 20+ DVDs I have put into this player, not one plays without interruption, skipping, stopping, pixellation, or other problems. Several of the DVDs will not even load at all."
1,I give it 1 Star only because there is no 0 Star option!!,"I am about to return my 2nd one of these units in two weeks. The first one, purchased just 2-1/2 weeks ago, lasted one week and played about 4 DVDs successfully before it started exhibiting all the problems other reviewers describe - skipping, freezing, refusing to scan, giving error messages, refusing to eject the DVD - it started doing something different with every DVD I put in -- except play it. I've never had a bad Sony product before, so I thought this was just a rare exception and I exchanged it for another one. The 2nd one only played one DVD successfully, then within 36 hours started having all the problems the 1st one had. So tomorrow it goes back, and you can be damn sure I won't exchange it for another Sony product! I wish I had checked here before wasting my time & money!"
2,TV Picture was distorted,"I bought this product and it was easy to install. I have DISHTV and there was no diagram to tell you how to install it. Once I did, I noticed immediately that the TV pictures wasn't as good as before. It was grainy and had a slight flicker. I tried to get information from Sony and got only canned answers back which were non responsive. So I have repacked this item and intend to return it. Very disappointed. I may try it one more time because it does have the items I was looking for and maybe this was a defective product. I was concerned about the criticism of the product in general by the other customer but I am willing to try it one more time before switching to another company."
4,Sony SLV-D350P DVD/VCR Combo,"The DVD door was lying loose in the box. Removed the front of my old DVD/VCR combo (same make and model)and installed it on the one purchased. Purchased this new one as rebuilt, wasn't sure what to expect. The description for it in the listing didn't state that the DVD door was unattached. The DVD & VCR player work fine. If it lasts a year or two, then it was $70 well spent."
2,Skips & Freezes about 1 hour into DVDs.,"After only about ten DVDs the video began freezing, skipping, and breaking-up. This occurs after about an hour of watching a DVD. I have to take extended intermissions to let the unit cool before it will play the DVD again. Hunk-o-junk. This Sony devotee is disillusioned."
2,my review,"My feelings about this DVD/VCR combo aren't too much different from those of all the other reviews. The design of the remote control is fairly preposterous. I don't know a lot about the different DVD players, so I can't comment on the picture quality. I have minor issues with the VCR function, such as the fact that the pause feature seems to lag some, and the play feature lags after rewinding or fast-forwarding. The main problem of this player is the DVD function. Homemade DVD-Rs and VCDs are very problematic on this player and occasionally don't play at all. And mainstream DVD movies frequently suffer skipping, freezing, etc. Like I said, I don't know a lot about DVD technology, but I would guess from my experience that one is better off getting a separate DVD player and VCR."
4,really? this thing has been amazing!,"wow. I have to say I'm extremely surprised to read all of the terrible reviews for this DVD player!I got this thing a little over 4 years ago. I've used it almost daily for that entire time; even went so far as to bring it on tour a couple of times. I've never had a single problem with reading DVDs or VHS cassettes of any kind. Nothing has ever malfunctioned or broken on it, and the thing still purrs like a kitten.my only two complaints, for the record, are that sometimes the ""auto"" clock function won't pick up a time signal through cable as it should, and I'm going to have to buy an up-scaling DVD player to accommodate the new HDTV I just bought.again, this thing has been awesome to me and I'll be sad to see it go.cheers!- Tristan -"
2,It Was Good Until It Failed...,"I've had this player for a little over 2 years and was happy with it until the middle of last week. Now after reading through some reviews, it looks like I'm just one of the many that had the DVD side of the player fail completely.On a positive note, up until the point it failed, both the DVD and VCR worked great. But while watching an episode of The Family Guy on DVD last week, the scene froze and no buttons had any effect. I unplugged it and it hasn't read another DVD since. It tries for a few seconds and then I get the word ""Error."" Just for fun, I even tried opening it up and fidgeting with the laser, moving it back and forth, but it looks like the DVD functionality is gone for good. :-("
2,Poor Quality for Sony,"I have this unit for 2 years and it has been barely adequate but not great like most Sony products. First, the buttons on the remote are still confusing to use after all of this time. Second the DVD will freeze up/skip on disks with a lot of compression or sound effects. Third, the remote doesn't work across the room unless you hold your mouth and wrist just right. Fourth, it has to think a few seconds about what to do when you push a remote button which makes you wonder if you were holding your mouth right. Finally, the last few months it has been going completely wacko on me by occasionally changing the time to some time in 2097, it loses or changes some of the recording times, and sometimes just forgets to come on at at its programmed time. I have always shopped Sony first but now I am starting to look elsewhere. It is time for a change. I would only recommend this to someone that I wanted to suffer at the hands of inferior engineering."
1,"Bad Product, Bad Customer Service","When I first bought this, DVDs would freeze at times and the image would decay to pixels at times. I contacted Sony customer service and they said that it was due to finger prints or scratches on the DVDs. After I had the machine for about 2 to 3 months, the DVD player stopped reading DVDs completely. I again contacted customer service and they told me to ship it to Texas and that they would send me a refurbished machine for ninety dollars. Actually, ninety was the minimum cost for labor since the warranty only covered parts. It could cost more if any of the parts were not covered by the warranty. Considering the cost of the machine, this was not a good option. I am stuck, but I hope that others won't make the same mistake and buy this machine. Also, after I ran into problems, I looked on Amazon for reviews of similar Sony DVD players. Sure enough, others had the same problem."
1,Conveniently broken after 13 weeks,"I bought this DVD/VCR combo from Best Buy about 13 weeks ago. The DVD player worked fairly well until the screen froze while watching The Ring. I could not get the unit to stop, play OR eject. I tried this several times with the remote and buttons on the unit over a few day period with no luck. Best Buy didn't want anything to do with it since it was over the 30 day return/exchange period. Sony now wants to charge me $29.95 to exchange it for a refurbished unit or $59 for fixing and returning my unit. So in summary, I spent $159 for the new unit, $29.95 for a refurbished unit and the associated shipping charges. Let's hope that Sony can get it right the second time around. I would not recommend ANYONE buy SLVD350P from Sony."
2,DVD Problems,I've had this unit for a little over a month and it completely stopped reading DVDs. It still reads audio CDs and the VCR is decent. I'd steer clear of this combo.
2,What's in a name?,"This item LOOKS great and has the SONY name...but its performance is definitely lacking. Upon engaging the machine, a buzz is heard. Watching a DVD is best. Only a slight buzz and the picture quality is adequate. But inject a VHS tape and the machine's buzz goes into overdrive. It is EXTREMELY loud and it will buzz along with the movie like an added track of unnecessary white noise.I'm still looking for a good replacement. I was ready to send this back the day after I bought it, but held onto it and will probably donate it someday soon."
1,Failed out of the box,"I selected this unit over other similar units because of the brand name. Out of the box, the unit could not load any of the movie DVDs that I tried. After a long delay, it would report an error saying that the disk could not be read. These DVDs all worked in my other DVD player. I took the unit back and exchanged it for another of the same model. Brought it home and it had the same exact problem. I then bought a different brand of combo unit and it worked just fine. It looks like Sony has a poor design or extremely bad quality control. The other brand had the same features and cost $50 less than the Sony which I bought on sale. Don't even bother trying this DVD combo."
3,Better than some - worse than others,"Ours worked wonderfully for about a year. We did not have a single problem with this unit until, about a year after purchasing it, it just stopped reading DVD's.... Still makes a wonderful VCR though ;)"
2,"Picture is fine, seems to work fine, but the NOISE????","I have had mine for only a few days now. I have had no trouble with the picture or play of either VHS or DVDs. My complaint is with the background noise of the unit itself. Both the DVD and VHS mechanisms make a lot of noise when in use. Some noise is to be expected on either type of unit in this price range, but the noise with either of these are too much and is not drowned out even with a ""normal"" volume. The fast-rewind works great, but the unit practically vibrates and again, is LOUD!Perhaps I just got a bad one. But I will be returning it nonetheless, sticking with my stand alone DVD player and older Sony VHS which is not as featured, but not as noisy, or perhaps I will look at the SLV-D550P, which has better reviews than this one."
3,False Advertising,"Don't buy this machine if you want, and think you are getting, the Commercial Skip feature. My ProScan which finally broke, had it and it was a worthwhile feature.Sony advertises the D350 as having commercial skip, when in fact, it doesn't. Instead of marking the commercial, as my ProScan did and then automatically fast forwarding through upon replay, the Sony just has a 30 second ""skip"" button, meaning you have to manually ""skip"" each commercial, in 30 second intervals.This is, at best, false advertising by Sony. I expected more from them.Image quality, both DVD and VCR are very nice, and set up is easy.Remote is very confusing."
1,Sony DVD problems,"To the reviewer below who said to do a Google search on Sony DVD problems. The correct Google search should be for ""sony C:13:00"" not ""sony ch:13""."
1,very undepndable,"First it records then the material disappears, spend 6 hrs recording check that is OK, go to finalize it either won't or says DVR is no good, don't waste your time and money. Using Sony DVR- media is a little better but but basically a complicated and bad unit."
1,Stay away !!,This combo dvd & video seemed like a good idea. I purchased it since it was made by sony. I have been very disappointed. The picture quality is sooo poor. It is a piece of junk! Stay away.
1,Stay Away,"I recieved this as a Christmas present. It was purchased refurbished at the Sony store the day after Thanksgiving and last night it just stopped reading all DVDs. It worked perfectly for 5 months, but then suddenly just died.I searched online to see what I could do to fix it and apparently lots of other people have encountered the same problem even with brand new units. The only way for me to get it fixed is to send it back to Sony who will exchange it for another refurbished one for $33.Stay clear, it just isn't worth it. If you decide to buy Sony, make sure you get a good warrantly plan because chances are that you're going to need it a year from now."
2,Quit working after two years.,"For nearly two years, this product served us well. Actually, we didn't use it all that much -- on average we would watch a DVD every 2-3 weeks. A few months ago, it would occasionally fail to recognize a DVD, or would otherwise freeze. I used a DVD cleaner, which I think ""maybe"" helped one evening, as we were able to get through a movie with just one instance of freezing. Not worth the frustration anymore, so tonight I am online shopping for a new device. I won't buy this model again. P.S., When it worked, it worked quite well -- good picture, easy remote, conveniently placed output ports. Not a bad product if you get a good price, but I think I could have done better."
2,Disapointed,My DVD side just bit the dust after about 3 years of service. Far less than I had expected from SONY.
5,Best online game and community around!,I was able to get SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs the first hour it was released and have spent an enormous amount of time playing the game online since. EVERYTHING about this game is better than the original from the weapons to the player movements to the maps. The other thing that makes this game so good is the tremendous online commmunity behind the game. The people that play the game online really do make SOCOM II special and the people over at www.SOCOMeSEALs.com help me to connect with other SOCOM II players so I can schedule matches and search for other players I see in rooms. I will be playing this game for a very long time and when another sequel comes out I will be playing that too!
5,people who don't like this game should go back to pacman,"it's people like Evan from the crappy country of Canada who just don't understand videogames. The point of a videogame is to be challenging. You would have to be a retard to not be able to get better at this game. Also, Evan the Canadian talks about everybody being better than you at first. Well, socom 2 gives you a rank, based on how good u are. Say you are just starting out, and you're an ensign, which is the lowest rank. They have rooms in Socom 2 for ensigns only, so you can play with people of your level. Don't listen to dumb reviewers like Evan, who either don't own the game, or have the IQ of a potato spud. Or is Canadian. Either one."
4,Socom II Navy Seals is a HIT!!,"I purchased this game a few days ago and havn't been able to put the controller down. The game takes you and puts you into a roll as a Navy Seal conducting missions to save man kind. You can play online or by yourself offline. The graphics and sounds are unreal and put you right there in the game.It does get some time getting to know the game, especially if you had played Socom I. The new game allows you to take hits and shows you what your damage is. To most it is an improvement others say it ruins the game. You will have to buy it and make your mind up on your own.If you are into a great player game or want to experience the biggest thrill you have ever had online then this is the game for you."
2,This game stinks....waste of money,"I hated this game. It is too hard. As soon as you start, boom you are dead.It takes FOREVER to get better in the game because when u are a beginner, the whole game is practically better than you. Ya so what, people shoot at each other in teams like the us navy seals. Even if you start to do bad, just a little bad, they will all vote you out and you will leave that room and you cant go back in. What if you are just new and you cant help it? Then for awhile you wouldnt be able to go into any room. And say your teammate was there and someone from the other team was running in front of him, you shoot him and just barely miss and hit your teammate. You tell them sorry, like I did and they still....vote you out. I have played a million games like that, that are much better. Try out Americas Army. It is MUCH better!This game is a huge waste! waste waste waste DO NOT GET IT."
5,The Sweetest Game of the Century,"SOCOM II is the best game that i have ever played. The graphics are the best that i have ever seen in a fighting game like this one. The online mode is 10x better than the original SOCOM and it has more maps. You can communicate with your team better, and it is more exciting. The only reason why you would stop playing SOCOM II is unless it is time to eat or go to the bathroom."
5,Best Online game hands down.,Ok I know there are hundreds of reviews already on this game but I just had to add my two cents worth... this game ROCKS ... the online part in about as good as it can get for any system the interaction between people via the head-set is great. I've seen hours melt away playing this game it's very addictive ... I haven't even played the single player game because the online part is JUST THAT GOOD but I will venture to say that it's probably just as fun to play as the multiplayer mode. So my advice to you is if have a playstation and a broadband connection you would be a fool not to buy this game c-ya online ** Socom screen name: FXB
4,socom II,"ok, socom2 is the worst game i ever played. if you wanna get a game that is worth 50 dollers get night fire or thug. peace"
1,Full of bugs and rushed out,No improvements and loaded with faults. As a result it is a very poor second to the quality title that is Conflict Desert Storm 2
5,SHORT AND SWEET REVIEW``,"BUY THIS GAME!!! I'm addicted but only to the online aspect. This is quitesential for online gamers. I your gonna buy online pack PS2, buy this game, NOW!!"
5,sequels only suck in movies,"this game is awesome....socom2 went far and beyond the call of duty when it comes to cool games..from the deeply entertaining multiplayer game...to the ultra challenging single player game it's got it all.the multiplayer game has you playing with up to 16 people as either US Navy Seals or as Terrorists from around the globe. with more then 20 maps to play on, it's hard to get bored with the same map.the single player portion of the game..is equally exciting with 3 standard difficulty settings: ensign, lieutenent, commander you can start out easy or start out hard...where is socom1 you had to work you way up to hard.another cool benifit to playin the single player...is to unlock charecter skins in the multiplayer potion of socom2.all in all this game is awesome.....if you buy it...and want to join a clan...you can contact meHEKLERleader of Legion Squad bravo"
5,Beta Tester,"I along with 9,999 other people am a beta-tester for this game. Yes right now there are problems but it is a beta version. There will be a total of 22 online maps and they have fixed some of the most annoying things. You really need to double tap down on L3 to switch the firing mode and on R3 to reload. I have logged plenty of hours and have yet to accidentally do either of these.The graphics have been updated and the new boards or HUGE even compared to the old ones.There is new softwear and systems in place that will supposedly eliminate cheating. I'm hopeful but we'll see.After actually playing it though, even if the beta version isn't changed much, I'm pre-ordering my copy TODAY!"
5,The Eagle Has Landed,This is going to be a cool game and since theres more weapons and items this is going to be even better!And the online play is going to be almost (and I said ALOMOST) the same accept more weapons and new locations...
4,this is an awsome game,ive had it sience it came out in august so i have had a lot of time to review it. first of all the single playeris not that good because its hard and they put so much on the online part. so if you want an awsome online game go out and get this game.
1,have not recieved it,Hi. I purchased this game last month on the 6TH of January and I still have not recieved this game. I cant rate it because i dont have it.
3,Too Linear......,"Ok the game does an OK job representing Navy Seals. But there are not enough game modes. There are only two. Play through the single player game or play online. Thats it. It would have been nice if they included a ""Custom Game"" menu so you could choose what ever level you want to play. They should have also added a ""Firefight"" game mode where you go around and get in firefights with terrorists. The graphics in many levels are way too dark also! The night vision sucks balls, so the only option is to increase the brightness on your screen and that makes the game look foggy."
4,Way better then the first SOCOM,"Pros:-Better levels-Better graphics-Better guns-Better then the firstCons:-You start at the beginning if you die-Some bad languageThis game is the BOMB.I love the levels,the guns,the characters,everything.I got up to the embassy level which is really fun.I like the 1st,2nd,and 10th level which is the embassy level.The graphics are perfect,the sound the guns make are just right,the controls are not hard{I have Sure Shot controls}and level designs are beautiful.(...)"
4,no title,"so, i know everybodys dying to hear the story...ah, who am i kidding?...nobody plays this for the story...they play it to be a navy seal..i dont even remember the storyline...the gameplay: now thats where its at...thats where this game holds its ground..i never remember the storys of these games with terrorits and such..unless is mgs..instead what sticks in my mind is the gameplay...lets recall wat i remember...stalking a gaurd for 5 minutes, gets my rifle sights on him, then BOOM....HE SEES ME!! and ahhh im dead...thats the worst thing of these games..is when i mess up i dont feel like going back to play it again...five minutes stalking a gaurd only to have him kill me, really makes me feel like ""aw just screw it""...which is why i never finished this game...but its not the games fault.. it comes with the genre...and if u like the genre u cant go wrong with this game"
5,Great Gameplay,"Very fun to play because of the variety of weapons and range of choices you can make. For example, you can choose to lead an attack or you can have others do that and you stand gaurd. the graphics are just awesome and the variety of weapons let you play in a stealthy way or shoot-em-up way. I would recomend stealth because you have less of a chance to be counter-attacked. the only bad part of the game is that sometimes (which is rare) you have to be so stealthy that it isnt fun. overall this game is an 11 out of 10."
4,Awesome but you cant replay.,"This is a extremely fun game except for the fact that you can not go back and replay missions over again, unless you want to start the game all over again. If you like the first one this one is a must."
4,single player= 3 stars Online=5 stars,"Lets be breef. Single player is ok id give it 3 stars because it is quite hard but you can do it and also commanding your team around can be difficult either by the toolbar or by the microphone. But Online is a different story id give it 5 stars for that, it is amazing you hav multiple maps to explore you have teams of up tp 8 vs.8 or less and even 2 vs.2. The grafics are gr8, but people can glitch and cheat. and some times lag occurs. If you like shooting games or you want a game and you hav online connections i would deffenetly get this game if i was u!!"
4,Love it like crazy,I give this game 4 stars because the improved single player i was hoping for was not there.. how ever this is the ultimate game for ps2 online. no lag on servers at all. and you don't need the microphonebuy this game for the online not the single player
5,This is One Cool Game!,I don't own the original SOCOM so I'm new to this series. I was amazed at the complexity of SOCOM II's interface and how comprehensive it was to manage. The gameplay is intense and I really like the sniper aspect. Issuing commands with the PS2 headset is really great and there's no setup or voice recognition ajustments to play with. Just plug in the headset and play. Going Online with SOCOM II is pretty sweet but since I'm new I'm going to sharpen my skills before taking it to Sony's intranet. You'll need the official PS2 network adapter to play future Sony Playstation 2 ONLINE games.Have Fun and Njoy Sony's SOCOM II: US Navy Seals!
5,THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY,"I've played alot of military games for PS2 but I have to say this game beets them all. Its so much fun you could just play it for hours with all the missions,wepons,and fun stuff to do. For this game I would defantly recmond the head set. It makes the game more fun trust me. Its a little more money but you cant aprecate the full quality of the game without it. And one more thing about this game,the online playing is the best. The game alone is great but with all thies great fetures, its hard not to love it!"
5,The Best Third Person Shooter Out Today.,"This game is the sequal to SOCOM and as you may know, SOCOM is the best online game for the Playstation2. There have been major improvements to the whole game. The HDD (Hard Disk Drive, Release date is March 2004) will support SOCOM 2. The online play is great is there is not much lag at all. There is a new mode online called Respawn and it is great, if you don't know what respawn means just look it up. The best thing yet in this game is the ability to talk in the lobby of a game. And also better yet there will be no cheaters on the game because of the DNAS. That prevents cheaters getting online and they get banned."
4,great game,"this is one of the best shooters for ps2. socom 1 was a little better, but this is still fun. i dont have online play though so that takes some of the fun away but i still recomend this, and socom 1"
4,good mulitiplayer okish games,the bad: the AL teamates are incrediably dumb so dumb that I often kill them in anger or they stand in my way a won't move and the missions are not the best. Small enviroments. Not very good graphicsthe good: good multiplayer. Nice selection of weapons. Weapon equipt screenNOTE WILL ONLY WORK WITH DUAL SHOCK 2 NOT DUAL SHOCK 1
3,Something to be desired,"I know its an older game on PS2, so Im NOT comparing it to today's games, But I am reviewing it based on what it is , and I am not in love with this game at all. It' cool that you can customize your team, and movement is ok, but it falls short on allot of the minor things that make it a game I want to sit and beat."
5,If you don't like this game it's because you never tried it,"This game is extremly fun and I'm only on the third mission. I recommend you try this game. The most surpriseing thing is that your buddies can actually shoot, Heck they can shoot better than me. Believe me I never had so much fun with a game since Delta Force BlackHawk Down. BELIEVE ME YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!!"
1,Whoops - the trash got into the dvd player again.,"The previous reviwer was incredibly generous, because this is a big steaming heap of misconstrued random thoughts and innuendos edited together randomly to create a truly boring documentary that commits the most serious crime any documentary may commit - apathy.The absolute most insulting bit is the notion that Chaplin may have met one of the people reputed to be Jack the Ripper. They spend about 5 minutes on this completely unimportant flight of fancy, 5 minutes of my life that I won't get back anytime soon.Ignore this disc."
1,Documentary & 4 shorts,"This POOR, BORING & INNACURATE documentary uses public damain stills & footage also includes 4 un-restored short films:The RinkThe ImmigrantTillie's Punctured RomanceThe Vagabond.I instead direct you to these wonderful Chaplin DVDs:Chaplin At Keystone: An International Collaboration of 34 Original FilmsChaplin's Essanay Comedies, Vol. 01Chaplin's Essanay Comedies, Vol. 02Chaplin's Essanay Comedies, Vol. 03Chaplin Mutual Comedies - Restored EditionModern Times: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]The Great Dictator: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]The Chaplin Collection, Vol. 2 (City Lights / The Circus / The Kid / A King in New York / A Woman of Paris / Monsieur Verdoux / The Chaplin Revue / Charlie - The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin)The Chaplin Collection, Vol. 1 (Modern Times / The Great Dictator / The Gold Rush / Limelight)"
1,"trash, trash, trash","If it's Delta it's dreadfull, if it's Alpha it's awfull and if it's Laserlight it's loadsome.....you may consider flushing your money down the toilet rather than buying any of these companies releases..they specialise in the WORST possible public domain copies around..in fact they have made it their mission never to go above the sub-standard...if you truly like silent or early talking movies like I do then avoid these companies like the black plague!"
5,My 18 month old son loves this DVD,"I know this might not suit adults to sit through the Wiggles again and again but my 18 month old son loves this DVD and dances, laughs and generally has a blast. He especially likes King Mondo (Ross Wilson) and the Wiggles doing the Eagle Rock. I can't get ""What's This Button For"" out of my head. Why the little aliens at the beginning like cows so much is a mystery...but I like the songs, they are refreshing after the daily grind of the Disney program - and I think the animation is cute. If you get the DVD watch the King Mondo part - I'd no idea this song ""Eagle Rock"" was a big hit in like the 70's in Australia."
2,Disappointed,"As an HUGE Wiggles fan, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. I don't like the songs, I don't like the animation (the Wiggles look a little creapy), and I don't like the story.On the contrary, my 4-year-old says she likes it."
2,Just not the same,Its a sub-standard cartoon. Its not the same quality as the other Wiggles DVD's. It only has a handful of songs and its the only Wiggles DVD we own that doesn't entice my child to get up and dance.
2,"Odd, Very few songs.","My 18 month son got this for Christmas. We both think it is awful!! First it only has about 4 songs.. Usually they have 15 songs. And personally I think the songs are stupid. Not like their normal songs. The animation was cute, but the story line was odd. Which a 18 month old really doesn't care, but it DID NOT keep his attention at all. This is one DVD that is going to be sold."
1,Weird!!! I can't stand this Wiggles show!,I don't recommend this Wiggles show at all. It is so weird and very unlike all of the other shows we've seen. My son usually loves the wiggles but this one is mostly animated with very few songs. Save your money! I'm going to try to sell our copy on ebay!
5,Fell in LOVE!,"My 18 month old daughter and I first heard this book at Story Time in the Library and we checked it out that day. We fell in love with it and I had to purchase it immediately to add to our collection. My daughter LOVES the sound effects and begs to have me read the ""dancing"" book to her. The book just flows and is so much fun to read, and the pictures adorable and brightly colored. This has become one of our favorite books!"
5,A winner!,"Between the story of a Hippo that loves to dance and the delightfully colorful illustrations, this is one of the sweetest books I've read in a long time. I read the book today and had to have it; I bought it immediately!!! It would be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection...."
5,A style of music somewhat unique,"While this album could be labeled many types of styles which im sure are only detrimental to the actual music, i would say they are a heavier, faster paced version of the more popular ""emo/hardcore"" scene ... a great cd with great transitions, breakdowns, intros and flow overall. This is one of those cds that you can play and will not be inclined to skip any particular song or section in order to get to the next song you might have heard before. I have never heard their other cd but i do have to say this is one of my favorite ... listen to ill make it to the brigades and try to not get into it. They rock, plain and simple."
1,where 2 or 3 are in agreeance...,"I totally agree with Brown Suga, these other reveiws obviously must be the groups freinds and I dont even know where Md is...7 Sons is the Wackest crappola I have ever heard, AND...who is that singing amazing grace? and why would it be an audio sample on the web for the world to hear?"
5,Great album,"I am not a family member, nor do I live in the northern area. I thought this album was HOT. It's like a neosoul quartet. I even saw them live first and then got the album and was not disappointed. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. My opinion is, great vocals, great feel, wonderful vibe. Definetly a must have if you like traditional or modern gospel. Can't wait for the next one."
3,"Thank you for the supplier, the DVD was exactly as described, and it came before the mentioned period.","Thank you for the supplier, the DVD was exactly as described, and it came even before the mentioned period.Thank you for the supplier.About the DVD, is not very useful like the book, its jusr brief about the NFPA 70E rules in short time. I would recommend buying the NFPA 70E book."
3,"HORRIBLE, except for ""i got 5 on it""","Hey this is the first cd from the luniz, you might know them from that song, i got 5 on it. I bought this cd, basically because of that song, and thats all i got. i was hoping for a LITTLE more, maybe just one or two other good songs, but it wasnt happenening. The reason this gets a 3 star instead of 1 or maybe 2, is because the song, i got 5 on it, is such a good song, you could put it on a barbara striesand cd, and i would still give it a 3 stars, just for that one song. Go buy the cd, or the single of i got 5 on it, if they have it, just for that song, cuase you really need to hear that song."
5,One Hit Wonders..,"I am a little late with this review, all I want to know where are they now? I thought that they would be around for a long time. The album is off the hook, but Where are they now???"
2,The tent poles were flimsy,Not at all what I expected. Would not recommend. The tent poles were flimsy and barely held the light material of the tent up. Not good for a twin bed or the floor. A waste of money!
2,Not worth the money,"We expected more from this product. It doesn't live up to the advertising. Plus, we thought it came with the mattress since it says ""tent bed"" in the description. Not worth the money."
2,Where is the zipper??,It was pretty easy to put together I did it by myself but the instructions were not very good. The picture on-line (and on the box) shows a zipper on the front but the one I received actually has velcro. May not seem like that big of a deal but I have a four year old with autism that likes to be in an enclosed bed. We odered the Nickel Bed Tent but it is still on back order. We got this because she was still in a crib and was able to get out of the crib tent so a regular bed was a much shorter jump ;-) We thaught this would hold us over until the other tent arived. With it just being velcro we will see how secure she feels tonight when I tell her it is time to go to bed.
4,Overall Good Purchase,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas a couple years ago, and it still looks brand new, despite the fact we haven't removed it from her bed since then. I keep it clean by wiping it down once a week with soap and water and once a month with Clorox wipes. I would give it five stars, but there are a couple things that bug me about it. The first is that the ends don't really stay tucked onto her mattress well, but they've never come up so much that the whole thing falls off the bed. The only other thing is that the flaps aren't long enough and when she tries to close them they ride up and leave a gap at the bottom. It doesn't seem to bother her yet, though. I've seen reviews about the flimsiness of the poles but I had no problem assembling it."
4,Girls love it!,Great secret hiding place for my 8 year old niece and her best friend. It was big enough for the both of them to sleep in. Good Christmas gift!
5,Awesome bed tent!,This tent stays put on the bed and the fabric and support poles are durable. We have been using it since Christmas and the kids love it and there haven't been any issues with it. The only downfall is that it goes over the mattress so there is no way to put a sheet on between the child and the tent bottom. They sleep right on the tent bottom. It's definitely lots of fun for the kids!
3,Retro mahjong,"I get the impression that this set is made to be an interior decorating accessory rather than a serious game set. The good looking and convenient wood box can be used to lend an asian accent to a room but the tiles themselves are a dissapointment. They are a bit crudely made with sloppy paint work on the face side and the bamboo backing on some tiles is splintering. They work well enough though and I will keep the set, but I will probably upgrade with nicer tiles to keep in the box."
1,Arrived broken to bits--can't even play it yet,"I eagerly anticipated the arrival of my beautiful, EXPENSIVE new mah jong set. When it arrived, I was appalled by its condition. The wooden box was split in several places and the portion intended to slide into the front of the box to keep the drawers for the tiles in place was completely broken off. The wood is so badly broken in places that parts of it are in splinters.Chinese Bone and Bamboo Vintage Style Mahjong in Five Layer Rosewood Box"
1,Not the best sequal out there.,This was not the best sequal out there if you know what i mean. it is a good game but too much credit given here.
1,not so great,"pretty much a rehash of the previous game -- not enough to do, not visually stimulating, and not all that impressive."
5,R&C is back!!!,"The original ""Ratchet & Clank"" was an astonishingly beautiful platformer, with superb graphics, qaulity sound, and brilliant gameplay. ""Ratchet & Clank 2"" is just as good, if not better than it's predocessor. Theres a whole new storyline, with 15 new weapons to use. Each level is twice as big as last time, with extra Maxi Games, such as the ""Wipeout Fusion"" style racer, and the chaotic gladiator arena. The game is easily worth every penny and should not be put down."
5,great,I've always loved the Ratchet and clank games and decided to get them all to have and so I could play them.
4,good game!,"Ratchet and Clank Going Commando brings a new meaning to gaming. The best part in my opinion is the gigantic Weapons! A good game! I would have given it 5 stars, but it just has a lot of glitches. Like when you swim in mid air, in first person mode you can climb up walls, enemies turn invisable. But even with those problems it's really fun to play- from my 12 year old son, a Zane review :)"
4,It's fun to blow stuff up!,"So I looked over that the clock and it was 2:30am!That is what happened to me the other night while playing the game for a ""few minutes"" before going to bed. This version of R&C; is a blast and the levels are a lot of fun going through. It's easy for a player to get pulled into each world with potential bad guys around the next corner, the great background sounds, and awesome graphics.My only issues (minor) are that I would like to see the game a little more difficult. For example: more ""secret"" things - like more bolts to find; more things to bash in the landscape, and more hidden areas to discover. Also, maybe some levels that limit the type of weapons that can be used - like on some of the arena challenges.Other than that, it's a great game! I'm looking forward to eventually reaching 1,500,000 so that I can cash in for the ultimate weapon."
3,Ratchet 1 1/2,"I enjoyed the first one and agree that this one is good, I only wish it was more different from the original, it feels like I have played this before. It is similar in almost every way, graphics, gameplay, design. There is a very good character building system in the game but this is only a band-aid for lack of new features. If you don't own the first buy this one, otherwise pass."
4,Old things can be fun,"I know this game is ""outdated"" compared to the R&C games, but I have played all 4 games. Although Deadlocked is the best, this game is the best for the ""budget"" Christmas. The game is entertaining, although the game is very long and gets old, you can always trade it back at Gamestop or EB Games"
5,I found this odd,"I was searching through the booklet and came across the name ""David Kaye,"" I thought I've seen this name before, so I went here to find out more. After searching Metal Gear Solid and finding out that the Ninja is played by Pinky from Pinky and the Brain and that Liquid Snake was Ryudo in Grandia 2, i search this game and there it was: David Kaye as Clark."
5,It just keeps getting better!,"When the first R&C came out, I was so excited because ps2 had finally came out with a new game. So i bought it and it turned out to be the greatest game i had ever played. When i finally beat it i was very disappointed. I hoped that they would come out with a new one. well now my dream came true. R&C are back and ready for action in this new action packed game. I'm sure yuo will be surprised with this new hit for the ps2.With 24 different levels and over 40 new weaponsyou'll be trapped in a world of explosions and more...."
5,"Fun, but Violent","Here's a review from someone who has played the game extensively, as opposed to other reviewers who have rated it prior to actually trying it out.Being a seasoned gamer, I must say that this is by far one of the most enjoyable platformers ever. There are tons of challenges integrated into the game, such as racing, arena battles in which you'll battle aliens for bolts/cash, space missions where you'll save space energy generators from sabateurs, and much more. The weapons are awesome, and better yet, upgradeable. Use them enough, and they'll become more powerful. Or, purchase a modual to make weapon projectiles dose boiling acid on or shock enemies for additional damage. The old weapons from Ratchet 1 and included, too.My recommendation is to not purchase this game for anyone under the age of 13 (heed the Teen rating). While the characters may be cute, gunfights can be a bit too overwhelming for the younger crowd."
4,Solid Game,"The game is great, coontrols, gadgets, puzzles.... but the storyline is decidedly weaker than the original. Good game."
5,A game ahead of it's time,"This game is by all means one of the best on the Playstation 2 console! The first Ratchet and Clank became one of my favorite games ever,and Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando was even better.Hard to believe that Insomniac equipped this game with even more weapons and more features than the first one,considering the first one was pretty maxed-out with goodies to begin with.In the sequel,Ratchet and Clank are in the midst of a ""hero-drought"" after defeating Chairman Drek. However,Ratchet gets a call from Mr.Abercrombie Fizzwidget,CEO of Megacorp,telling him that Megacorp's newest experiment,the Proto Pet,has gone missing. Ratchet and Clank set out to get it back,and discover some surprises along the way.The cinema sequences are hilarious. This game is truly a gem in it's own right. A very good game overall."
5,s2s/five one 3 game lover,it was the best out of both of them there were a lot more wepons and more chaling levels
4,Its cooool!!!!!,If you like fighting you'd love this game lke me.You buy weapons and blow up robots it is cool!
1,Ratchet & Clank Going Commando,We have other Ratchet & Clank games but this one here didnt work. You get about 4 challenges in and the game frooze. Going to have to make sure to check next time before getting a used game!
2,Dont get the Hipe,I don't get the Hipe of this. I think Jak 2 is better than this and i don't understand the great review. I think it is a good game but not great.
4,THIS IS AWSOME!,"The first time I played this I craped my pants, it was so sweet, there are like 24 weapons and most of them up-grade to even sweeter weapons. I beat it already.. and now its even funner! You start with all your weapons and health so you can blow the crap outa things that you couldnt before! The maxi games are wicked, the space battles are the funnest, so are the hoverbike races. This is one the greatest games EVER! Ive told you enough, so go get it! NOW... NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW!!!!!!!!"
2,5 stars.,"When the first Ratchet and Clank came out I was totally blown away. The engaging characters, the addictive gameplay, the imaginative settings, the amazing graphics. It was as though a whole new universe of fun had been created.This game repeats the glories of the first R&C;, and then some. Another big corporation has threatened to take control of everything, so it's up to our two heroes to make their way through a whole universe of planets. There's so much to see and do, so many sub-games and atmospheric worlds to explore. Add to that a whole load of dramatic tunes and hilarious cartoon sequences and you have one of the greatest platform games ever made."
2,(A lot) Better than the first,"Yessir, Ratchet and Clank return, hotter than ever. This game featurs 25 destructive super weapons, including R.Y.N.O 2, Mini Nuke, Zodiac, Lancer and 5 other Gadgetron weapons from the first game. The storyline is a little more complicated, featuring that some characters are not the ones thought first when you see them. The Theif will have you confused when you see who he really is. Actually: Who ''She'' is. there are great Maxi-games in this game, which are just big minigames, including: Hoverbike races, Gladiator Arena Battles, Electrolizer Targets and more. It' s safe to say that this game is a lot better then the first. Many of you had maybe think that Ratchet and Jak are rivals in a gaming war, but the credit list says: Special Thanks to: All of the Naughty Dogs. But who cares. This game is really fun. It takes a lot of time to finish it. an this game really should be whith an E rating instead of T. I highly recommend it. BUY IT NOW!!!!!"
3,not nearly as good as jak ii,now dont get me wrong i really enjoyed this game. but jak 2 is so much better. for more challenges more impressive graphics and unbelivably fun and rewarding gameplay. going commando is very fun but its probally aimed at insignifigant gamers. jak has a better storyline and much more challenging gameplay. everything in this game is a big task. if youre 13 get going commando. if youre a little older jak 2 is the one youll like.
4,really fun,"the game is a step up from the first one. you can upgrade your weapons by just using them, which is really cool so you dont have to buy them like in the first one. its just really great fun and the humor is great too."
5,This game is not cool. Just kidding.,This is the coolest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You get so many weapons and the enemies are superdy duper cool. Thats right. SUPERDY DUPER COOL!!!! Get this game and play all day. It is so good that I quit my job and played it since it first came out. I have only beaten two planets but it rocks. I think it was a poor choice to quit my job though. I know live with my mom and that just isn't cool. I have a beer belly and a beard that goes to my waist but I play this game ten hours a day. Yeah baby!!!! Oh I am due for my back wax. Gotta go!
3,"Curious, But Depressing Work","Bowie is always experimenting and this collection does hold a few gems, ""Strangers When We Meet"" and ""The Hearts Filthy Lesson"". However, the strange narratives that are dispersed throughout are supposed to add to the concept, but just annoyed the hell out of me. It was disappointing and depressing, being a Bowie fan, but at least there were a few good songs I could burn to another CD. I also wonder that if Bowie thought this was such a great album, why did he allow it to be packaged so badly? Cardboard?"
1,Do not buy this phone,"Phone is really subpar. Voice quality is poor to inaudible. Feels and looks cheap and plasticky. People ask ""what is wrong with your phone...It sounds tinny""."
4,Pleased with quality,"We live in a small town and I always had to order chambray shirts thru the catalog because there was nowhere local that carried them. When the catalog company ceased to carry them I searched Amazon and found them. Ordered these thru Amazon a couple of years ago and my husband is still wearing them. These short-sleeved chambray work shirts were of nice quality, cool and effective workwear in summer. Hope the company continues to make them and I will order them again if I can get them thru Amazon."
3,the child in time,"Parts of the book were a bit depressing. I almost gave up and did not complete reading it but if you start hang in until the end. There a lot of ""stuff"" about the committee the main character served on that I just skimed over. It was very boring for me personally."
3,Disappointing,"The book starts out very gripping when it goes to the scene at the grocery store, but then the author really doesn't touch much on anything regarding the child. McEwan mainly goes on for ever about all the mental issues the parents deal with in their loss. Understandably, there would be tremendous sadness, & anxiety, but the author could have done so much more with creating a story that would be more interesting & gripping if McEwan would have developed it in the direction of what actually happened to the child, & maybe even scenes where it is with the child involved in it. I found myself skimming a lot just to get through the book."
2,Disappointing,"Having read and enjoyed nearly all of McEwan's work, I was very disappointed with The Child In Time, a novel which felt formulistic and paint-by-the-numbers. The characters are bland and uninteresting, and in that we don't care about the characters we're never really drawn into the novel.The plot revolves around Stephen Lewis, an author of children's' books who takes his 3-year old daughter to a supermarket where she is kidnapped. The events which follow concern Lewis' reflection on his life, on time, and on his relationship with his wife.A premise full of promise for McEwan's signature dark insight, but one which in my opinion never really pans out. Read instead McEwan's excellent Black Dogs or The Comfort of Strangers."
1,Bland,"I tried to force myself to finish this book figuring at some point it had to get better. Needless to say it did not. While I see other reviewers thought this was an excellent book, I guess for me this author's style of writing just wasn't interesting."
2,Didn't finish it,"I haven't finished this book.I read a little over half and couldn't go any farther. It started out catching my interest, but I thought it would be about trying to find the main characters daughter and that wasn't the case, at least through the first half. The characters were boring. Just wasn't what I thought it would be."
2,"Good beginning and end, boring middle",I really enjoyed the first few chapters but then the book dragged on. Too many unrelated topics. McEwan is a great writer but this book did not hold my interest.
3,His writing is good but long-winded,To begin with I must state that I am not a fan of Ian McEwan's writing. I find his stories to be depressing. The premise in the novels I've read seems to be some tragic or momentous event early on in the story and the rest of the novel is spent dissecting the lives of the characters in the novel. So it is in this one: a missing child; disturbed parents; wierd friends and always weak flawed males.To me his books dangle the prospect that everything will turn out well in the end. It never happens. There is often some farce such as the crazy prime minister in this book. The ending is meant to be uplifting but these sort of endings only happen in fairy tales.To keep reading his stories for me is a form of madness (expecting a better literary experience with each novel. ) I think people keep buying his books because he is touted as the best current author in England. Have they not read 'The Emperor's New Clothes'? Not recommended
3,A little disappointing,"Maybe it was just me, but one of the first books in a long time that I gave up on. Perhaps will pick it up at a later date."
2,Not up to scratch,"I've read lots of Mr. McEwan's work, and every other novel is brilliant. Unfortunately, this is the Other novel. Atonement and Enduring Love were wonderful, Saturday a disappointment, and Amsterdam a disaster. This is the worst yet. The plot centers around the kidnapping of the main character's young daughter and his reaction to the tragedy. There is no significant character development, a gratuitous Prime Minister, a suicide sweetly explained away by the deceased's wife, and pages of rambling, seemingly pointless prose. There is a certain redemption in the last few pages, but that does not offset the pain of the middle part. Try one of his other works instead."
4,This Book will be lasting and significant,"To be alive is all, is reason enough to be. And that is reason enough for a young man of no accomplishments to write his autobiography, if he can write as beautifully as McEwan"
1,Terrible singing,I've never heard worse singing on a recording. The performance here is technically bad and uncommunicative. Quite an appalling release.
1,One of the worst,This is one of the worst cd that I've come across. The singing is very deficient. Cannot be recommended at all.
2,untrue title,THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL ABC PARAMOUNT SINGLES BUT RCA RE-RECORDINGS . 15 of the original recordings were released a few years ago in the UK by TELSTAR and no longer availiable. Is it not time a 2/3 cd set of all original Paul Anka s Big 15 Vols 1. 2 and 3 were released . i understand paul himself may have these recording himself all i can say is true fans are fed up with copies we want the real 15 year old Paul Anka single back in our collection soonest perhaps by end of 2007.
4,Great car and restaurant toy.,"We keep this in the car and will bring it into restaurants. It attaches well to his car seat and highchairs with link-a-dos. Maybe not my son's most favorite toy, but still nice!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"This book clearly has the best opening line of ANY book I have ever read. The author sent me a copy of the first chapter before he finished the book. It just about killed me waiting until I could buy it.This book is a, well, how would I call it? A crochety old editor (Close to Archie Bunker, but no, not really) that has the ability to throw out lines of dry humor that cause you to run around and read them to your friends, who then run out to get their own copy of the book.This author has a cult following of many of his other books. I have read many of them and I see the attraction. Personally, I think that this is his best."
3,"Mead yes, Tice no!","The essay by Mead is a thorough and fascinating discussion of this intriguing character. The perfect introduction to Simon Magus. On the other hand, the foreword by Paul Tice reads a little like a child's school book report. Mr. Mead would have been embarrassed by this most unscholarly introduction. If you're interested in Simon Magus, get Mead's essay, but not in this edition."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! A GEM!!,"A-Team line up, including : Von Freeman - tenor, Kenny Wheeler - trumpet/flugelhorn, Tommy Flanagan - piano, Dave Holland - bass, Kevin Eubanks - guitar, Ed Blackwell/Marvn ""smitty"" Smith - drums/percussion, and Steve Coleman - alto sax PLAY two Thad Jones' numbers, one by Kev Eubanks, and three of Steve's original compositions, including the absolutely beautiful Sweet Dawn, a lyrical ambient piece without alto - mostly Tommy Flanagan soloing, with horns.. but the CD is worth the price for this composition alone. Dave Holland's ""Pass it On"" gets a brilliant treatment - to my mind, better than on his recent album by the same title.. Anyway, If you like great music.. jazz that swings, that explores or pushes the envelope a little at times, and is definitely music that will transcend it's date of making.. this one is highly recommended!!!"
5,Excellent & Innovative Guitar,"These guys rock. I heard them once on the radio and had to have the CD. The CD is more than I had hoped for and the DVD which comes with, is inspiring. If you like guitar, if you like percussion, if you like innovation, then buy this CD. You won't get bored of it."
5,Just Fab,If youre looking for just fab spanish guitar music and a rock solid beat this album is for you... The music just enwraps the listener with full and warm sounds.
3,Good listening,"This is a good album but after listening to RODRIGO Y GABRIELA and C.U.B.A., it falls short somewhat. The musicianship is there but the song selections leaves something to be desired. I liked 3 of the 9 songs."
4,I'll go 4.5 stars,"If you at all like acoustic guitar, buy this disk! The pair is simply amazing. Song-by-song, their work is unbelievable. The only thing that held me back from 5 stars is that it gets a bit repetitive. But when put in a tray with a few other disks and set to random, this CD is outstanding! The DVD is short, but great. They are really fun to see live. At $11, it is a steal!"
5,Talented pair,"Great purchase. These two are so talented and have a unique drum sound made with their guitars. Enjoyed the bonus DVD as well - beware, Gabriela has a potty mouth."
5,Fantastic Guitar Music,"Great music to simply list to around the house on the weekends, awesome background for having friends over. Blends in wonderful with the Jack Johnson and Norah Jones that I have on the playlist. The sound quality is about what you should expect for a mid-lvl artist."
4,Rodrigo y Gabriela,"This is a stunning debut from two former street performers, Rodrigo & Gabriela. To me, it sounds like the Gipsy Kings meets Nirvana Unplugged. The guitar-work on this album is truly amazing. Also, the use of slapping on the guitar's bottom in place of a drum is pretty cool.The only complaint I have is that I wish some of the songs had more varied instrumentation. One song features a violin, which definitely adds to the cool-factor.This is the sort of album that you can put on and people will definitely ask, ""Who's that?"" Overall, this is a really impressive debut. I can't wait to see what they do on their next album!"
5,must have,"do not miss this disc, if you do not like it i will shovel you snow, or cut your grass for a year."
4,RyG rock,"Rodrigo y Gabriela make amazing music. From a ""thrash metal"" (if that's the right term) beginning, the sound emanating from these two acoustic guitarists is unbelievable. Inspired by Stanley Jordan, their version of Stairway to Heaven is fantastic (I'm a Stairway to Heaven tragic}."
4,Duo worth listening to,"This duo does some amazing guitar work! If you like acoustic guitar and a fast pace, you'll like this. I first listened to this duo on NPR (WXPN 88.5 in Philadelphia) and really liked them. Enough to want the CD."
5,Believe the Hype,This is one of the few Cd's that I purchased without hearing a note first. The duo is incredible. Gabriella is an amazing rhythm player and with the DVD that came with it you can see the jaw dropping technique of both players. Rodrigo can keep up with the best of the speed metal players that influenced both of them. Their take on Metallica's Orion is just beyond belief esspecially during the middle section that the late great Cliff Burton composed. It's a dirty shame that they had to leave Mexico to be appreciated.
5,great music,"I love the whole CD, and I appreciate how prompt Amazon was on getting it to me in a timely fashion!"
5,"Very Unique Sound, Every Guitar Player Should Own This CD!!!!","This is one of the best CD's i have ever listened to!!!This is the type of cd that you can listen to over and over again.The bonus dvd lets you know the history of them, and they also teach you how to play the guitar like them.This is a cd that you must listen to, especially track 7,orion, it is possibly the best track in the cd.A MUST BUY!!!!"
1,It's ok. But...,"I think the music is ok but boring. The musicianship IS decent, but the production sounds very humble and home done on a computer with cheap software. It's interesting to hear the covers one time. I value my listening time and guard it jealously. Who would waste an hour on this when you can be listening to the great Spanish Guitar Masters? For guitar music that truly captures the heart I'd rather listen to the greats of Flamenco like Paco de Lucia or Manolo San Lucar's Tauromagia for example. This cd pales so horribly IN COMPARISON to the music of the Spanish Masters. But of course if Rolling Stone says it's good than it must be."
1,rodrigo Y gabriela,I can't tell you how my customer like the product. We have not received it yet and we are in the process in trying to find out where it went. The postman left it at my store stuffed in my door handle and when I came back from a funeral it was not with my items he had left. We were closed untill one p.m. he delivered the mail at nine thirty a.m.. Still no clue as to where it is. So score me a zero for nowThanks Christopher
5,very satisfied,he loves this cd and it arrived to him quickly and in great shape. thank you very much
4,Really Fun Music,"I heard this on the radio and went home and ordered it. Since then I've ordered 3 more for gifts as I've seen how much some friends like it. It's really fun music. I'm not an expert on Flamenco Nuevo (or any other type of music for that matter) but ultimately, it boils down to what you like and this is just fun and sounds great through a good stereo. It's quite amazing how full a sound they have from just two guitars. I didn't give it 5 stars for a couple of reasons. Musically, I suspect they're going to get even better; to me it feels, at times, ever so slightly repetetive and the cover of Stairway to Heaven seems a little stilted. Secondly, the DVD is PG-13 (or worse?) for language. I'd like my kids to be able to watch the whole thing but R&G don't express themselves verbally as beautifully as they do musically."
4,I love this CD,This CD was fantastic! I think I listened to it three times in a row. I saw them play a few months ago on a late night show and they were mind blowing. Well worth checking out.
4,Rodrigo y Gabriela,Great fun! Even better to watch them perform as you can do on the included DVD.I don't think much of most current pop music but this is the exception that gets played often.Rodrigo provides the melody and Gabriela the driving beat. Their music shows that a great musical heart can sometimes beat conventional good technique.Highly recommended. I have yet to find anyone who didn't really like it. Small wonder they get standing ovations whenever they perform.
5,Unexpected WOW,"I bought this CD/DVD as a Christmas gift for someone difficult to buy for. It was recommended by a friend. One word....WOW! Rodrigo and Gabriela are fantastic.....and they make a big sound look like child's play. It was a ""hit"" :)"
5,rodrigo y gabriela,"I saw them on a late show and was blown away. Great, as was the price through Amozon."
2,Engenheiros... falling apart....,"I'm a big fan of this brazilian phenomenom, and i have preetty much all of their cds, but this last release really could have been a lil' better. Gessinger doesnt seem to be taking the lyrics and the music itself as serious as he used to. It is now a band of a bunch of little kids w/ Gessinger on the vocals. Since the day Maltz and Licks left, I still had some faith left in the band. Untill the day i heard this cd."
3,Nice for comfort !,"The shoe arrived promptly, the color was lighter than the picture and the fit is a little loose, but they are comfortable and soft. Good for leisure."
2,thongs,"I ordered the same size in two different models of this gel sandal, this one was way off, absolutely huge, would not order this style again"
2,Not a ... item,There is no way this is a ... item. I added one to my order because I wanted to see what a ... drywall clip was. You can probably buy these at your local hardware store for less than $.50.
4,Easy and strong,"I know this is just small tiny thing to write a review about, but I think it's important.According to its size it does a lot.I'ts pretty strong and never breaks down.If you need something like this, it's the right one."
4,93% Harmful to Hippies,"Beneath the Massacre's ""Mechanics of Dysfunction"" is heavy, fast, and packs enough aggression to make a barefoot hippy miscarry. Because the band is from Canada and their music is fairly technical, some reviewers have compared them to Cryptopsy. It is my opinion, however, that this CD sounds like a group of speed freaks jackhammer fighting behind a liquor store, while the drummer from Origin kicks over trashcans.While there is plenty of Cryptopsy-esque technical speed riffing, the majority of this CD is a big wall of blast-beat-driven, machinegun guitar. The vocalist does a great job, never sounding any less metal than a robot in a trash compactor. And while some songs on the CD blend together like a series of explosions at a meth lab, each song does have its own hook or riff to distinguish it from the others.Aside from occasional monotony, albeit brutal monotony as heavy as anvils, this is a great CD."
5,A Sweetness to the Soul,"I absolutely loved this book! I was so anxious to read every word, all the time not wanting it to end. It was so real to me, I could smell the fresh air and feel the spray from the the Falls. I felt the pain of each loss, but also the joy of love, friendship and very hard work. Jane Sherar was unbelievably brave, as was her wonderful husband Joseph and to think that they were a very real part of settling that part of our country. They feared nothing but the thought of losing each other. They had such a fierce devotion and loyalty to the people with whom they shared their lives: Benito, Sunmiet, the Turners, Ella and all the others. Jane Kirkpatrick is such a prolific writer, with a wonderful knack of giving us every detail, making us feel a part of the lives and the community of every book she writes. Just an outstanding book...I loved it!"
5,A Sweetness To The Soul,"When Jane Herbert was twelve years old a terrible tragedy took the lives of her brother and sister. Jane blamed herself, partly because her parents believed the accident was her fault. Burdened with guilt and grief, Jane only began to recover when she left home to ride with her Indian friend, Sunmiet and her family.Then Jane met Joseph Sherar and it didn't seem they had much in common. For one thing he was quite a bit older and for another, he didn't get along with her father. Plus, Joseph was a dreamer who believed he could do anything. But God and love have a way of working things out.Jand Kirkpatrick is an elegant writer with a deft touch. Her characters live on the page. The plot is complex and intriguing and her research is detailed and accurate."
4,You Tell Me!,I just got this 6440 and new to laptops. It seems like a good unit for the price. I was hoping for other reviews while I have time to return it if need be. Peace on Earth
2,Good price - but thats it ...,"nice display, no build in microphone.i have it for a week now, and it got stucked twice already while i was installing visual studio 8.im giving it another chance before replacing !"
5,Excellent Product and Service,"I ordered this right before Christmas. (Bad timing on my part.) Since I didn't need it for Christmas and Amazon said delivery would be after Christmas, I told Scott at BrandNew Industries that delivery after Christmas would be fine. It was delivered two days before Christmas anyway.I also must say that I'm quite impressed with the branding iron. I immediately tried it on some scrap. No doubt it takes a little practice, but after a few tries I got one that looked fabulous. I had my doubts that you could do a signature that small and have look really good, but I was wrong. For the price, I almost feel like I ripped BrandNew Industries off.Thanks for a great product, great price and great service."
4,No poke check???,"To be honest, I do enjoy this game... Why? well hell, it hockey. I love hockey. Do you?? If you don't then why the hell are you reading this? But if you do, pick this up and play it. It's cheap, and not to shabby. Now don't get me wrong, it's not the best hockey game out, but in a pinch? It will do fine. You can always score in the slot."
2,To easy to save shots.,The control of the goalie makes it way to easy to save shots. You start to save every shot your opponent shoots.
3,Not worth $60,"The game is fun but not much different than NHL 06 for x-box1. (I was dissapointed that the 360 could not play this game). I have heard about a saving problem on this game from a few people and it's not that the game has no save option, it's just that it's very dificult to figure out how to do it, and the instruction book doesn't help at all. The only cool thing they have added is the goalies ""crease control"" option.(My son is a goalie so, of course, he thinks that's awesome). Definetly not worth $60"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"WARNING: This is NOT a next-gen console game, far from it. Microsoft is busy creating patches to play ""old"" games from the original Xbox on the 360...Take2 Interactive beat them to the punch, packaged the game for the 360, and raised the price by $40.By no means does this showcase any sort of graphic capabilities of the 360. In fact, it actually looks worse in high def. None of the interface graphics were developed for high def - they're all jaggy, aliased, and look like they were from a Sega Genesis.The game plays well. The commentary is awful. Wait til next year or at least buy this for an older platform and save the money....it's almost a crime to charge $59.99 for this game."
1,This game is a waste of money.,This game is terrible. I love hockey. I love this game. BUT there is a huge flaw in the game. The game has issues with saving to the hard drive. It cause it to freeze up after you play a game. You can't save or anything. You just have to reset it. I'm not the only one having issues with this game. Go check the 2K Sports forums. There are plenty of other people having the same problem. 2K Sports is failing to admit any fault. There only response has been to reformat the hard drive or to buy a memory card. They put out a faulty game and making money off of people not being able to play it. This game is TRASH.
2,Waste of money,"Maybe it's just me, but the AI on the player's team seems to be a couple notches lower than on the computer's. This is especially true for penalties and goalies. Most often, there seems to be 5-6 penalties against AI controlled players on the human's team in a game with 10 minute periods, and at most 1 on the computer's side. The goalie AI is just weak, like it's assumed that the player will use the rediculously easy goalie control feature.Aside from these two issues, there is almost a complete lack of any franchise mode, aside from new drafts and some moderate skills excercises."
3,Why the obligatory British jerk?,"Very interesting video about the history of the Jesuits but the British bozo (brought in for ""balance"" no doubt) was an unfortunate addition. The Jesuit concern for the poor and disenfranchised is dishonored by this man's callous dismissal of their work as ""trendy."""
3,"Good, though not great, sci fi","In this short novel by Adolfo Bioy Casares, originally written on 1940, a fugitive escapes to an isolated island. Soon, though, people start arriving in the island, and particularly a woman named Faustine with whom the narrator becomes smitten, but no one seems to notice him. Is this a dream, a fantasy or (SPOILERS AHEAD) a technological breakthrough is operating in the island, which has recorded the presence of people on the island some 16 years ago so faithfully that it is impossible to tell recording from reality. Despite the extravagant praise by Bioy's friend Jorge Luis Borges in the foreword, this book is good, but far from great. As one of the reviewers noted, the concept might seem novel in 1940, but after the Twilight Zone and zillions of sci-fi/fantasy movies, if you read it today, it seems you have been in this place before."
3,Scifi novel of ideas,"Praised by many writers, this is a novel akin to films like ""The Outsiders"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" in that it centers around a fantastic explanation for the odd happenings over the course of the story. The explanation is so verbose and unnecessarily detailed for the function of plot alone that it purposefully strays into philosophy and how we perceive the world and interact with others. Insightful aphorisms dot the narration. The major fault I find with novels of this sort (and I believe many of the European writers are kin, like Kundera and Calvino) is that they fail to tie their mechanical plot symmetries to lifelike characters. Instead their characters talk in robotlike voices, vaguely imitating real people without the unique inflections of lifelike individuals. These authors have the imagination but not the mimetic skill to make fiction come to life. So reading them is like watching a puppet play, interesting for the plot convolutions but ultimately emotionally detached."
3,It's not bad.,"I must agree with other reviewers that this book is more interesting for the ideas it raises, than for the story itself. A thought provoking read that is ultimately a little dissatisfying. Not a bad book though."
5,My kids love P&F,"As a matter fact, it is one of those shows that as a grown up you don't mind sitting down and watching with your kids."
1,Pain in the Rear,"Waisted time trying to set this up only to discover that it seems one needs to have one of the approved devices for this to work. Great idea folks, just poorly explained and executed."
5,Very intelligent and funny cartoon,"I like the characters, running gags, and creativity in this series. The kids and I love to sit together and watch it. It's nice to have funny, non-violent (rarely) cartoons.They have great original music (Gootchy gootchy goo and Squirrels in My Pants get stuck in your head). I like seeing what ""Phineas and Ferb"" are ""going to do today,"" and watch Candace try (and fail) to ""bust them."""
3,"A *Guide*, not a *Reference*","This book is exactly what it's title says: a *guide* to using Apache Ant, particularly for Java development. Note, though, that it is *not* a *reference*. It does not describe each Ant task in detail, nor does it document all the allowable Ant XML elements.That's why I was disappointed with this book, and only gave it three stars. O'Reilly has an unfortunate habit of giving the same type of title to any of its books on a subject, regardless of their real content. Thus, ""HTML and XHTML: The Definitive Guide"" is a both a *guide* and a *reference*, and pretty much the only HTML book you need.""Ant"", on the other hand, really needs a companion reference for more experienced Ant users. Anyone who uses Ant soon realizes that the online documentation is less than stellar.This book is a necessary starting point for Ant; now we need more! Ant, after all, is worth documenting, since it's *much* better than any alternative out there."
3,"A Good Introduction, but Only an Introduction","This book provides a good enough introduction to Ant, but it only takes you to the point of knowing how to use Ant and not the point of knowing how to use ant on a project of any size. As an introduction it works well. You learn how to get up and running with Ant very early on in the book, and you learn all of the key tasks rather quickly as well. Everything is explained clearly, and it seems reasonably organized. What it lacks is really any explanation of various best practices for using ant, whether on a small program or a large one. For a book of this size, I was surprised at the absence of this info and ultimately I felt that it was only a bit more useful than the free online docs for ant."
3,First edition was better,"They removed this really nice reference section in this (2nd) edition. That reference section is what really got me going in ant. I suppose the information is in the ant documentation, but I liked having it in the book.Overall, the book is still ok."
2,Disappointed,"I read this book to learn how to read existing Ant scripts, but I'm much disappointed at the many failed explanations of Ant basic concepts. For example, the description of paths and patternset left much to be desired. I HAD to consult another Ant book!!"
5,Got Me Going Quickly,"Web research on Ant revealed a lot of explanations, but they were very hard to understand. And I didn't want to waste time scratching my head. This book explained what Ant is and how it works in an approachable way without insulting my intelligence. The author obviously has a lot of experience in Ant and many of the other technologies it interacts with. While other comments have pointed out that it's not a reference, I can easily get those other details on the internet. This book got me up and running with Ant quickly and painlessly. It contained useful examples that actually worked when I tried to follow them."
3,Good summary af Ant's tasks,"I knew a little bit about ant tool before this book. It was very often struggle for me to set properly new values of properties. Now I know why. So this book gives a lot of useful information. It also gives complete survey of all ant tasks. But sometimes it seemed to me that there is too much pages with just drought list of possible options, attributes, tasks and elements. I would appreciate more pages with examples. The examles which you can download to this book are quite explanatory but sometimes it is problem to run them because you need another jar files from other sites (especially EJB).But even so I am happy I bought this book. When I meet a problem I know where to find it in the book."
1,Not much ado about health,"Not a bad book, but the title and subtitle are wrong. It starts with the obligatory 2 chapters on Watson, Hazeltine, and Venter that anyone can read on any number of web sites, so it really doesn't get going until page 90, and then the last two chapters are the obligatory angel/devil arguments of morality that almost anyone can write at this point. What's left in the middle has problems with repetition and lack of focus. There are one or two really interesting factoids in this book, but zero insight and no real value. (...)"
4,its ok...,"It is beautiful, and durable, but none of the tack that I have actually FITS on the horse! I don't have that racetrack tack, but I'm sure that that won't fit either."
5,Seabiscuit,I think seabiscuit would be good for kids 8 and older. Also I think he is good for anyone who loves him. he looks just like seabiscuit.
1,Get Peter Tassoni's book instead,"I don't know what the author intended, but this book is of little value to anyone. It is not useful as a guidebook (the few bits of practical information are written in a way that would be more appropriate in a magazine) and the rest rambles on about the author's personal experience. Much of the book has a superior and sanctimonious tone. Even more irritating is the author's use of shorthand words or non-words, such as ""vue"" instead of view, or ""thru"" rather than through. Worst of all is a chapter called ""Thots"", which I guess was supposed to be Thoughts. Please don't insult readers this way. There is nothing inherently uncool about clarity and good spelling.Bottom line: Don't buy this book. I can't see it being of any value to someone contemplating a visit to Cedar Mesa. There are two other books sold by Amazon about Cedar Mesa, both of which I found far more useful or enlightening."
3,inexpensive and cheap,"These pliers have nice grips and will work for light-duty use. However, don't expect high performance. The very first time I used the cutting pliers to cut metal bands off of a packing crate, the shiny metal veneer chipped off (crumbled really) revealing cheap pitted metal underneath."
1,Tissot T-touch,"I also purchased a TISSOT T-Touch watch from Amazon...Worked great for 12 months, then the battery went low.....After mailing to NJ for battery per website instructions, I got a service estimate for $375 !... After I called they told me that they dont support warranty on watches bought online.... and would mail the watch back to me , or I could pay $375 and get battery and full service on my $425 watch.. Now I'm left with a watch and no idea how to replace battery."
5,This is GREAT!,"I was surprised to see Dir being sold on Amazon.com and i hope they would have more of their merchandise. Anyway, this is one of my favourite Dir songs!They are fantastic band, especially with vocals like Kyo's. I like the use of both the acoustic and electric guitar on this track. And though the lyrics are a little depressive and the echoing at the beginning of the song might throw you off abit. It's a fabulous track to get!"
1,Do not buy this game!,"When I first bought Amped II on the original XBOX I couldn't stop playing it. The controls were easy to master, the game play was fun, quick and dynamic. This game is none of these. The action feels sluggish and frustrated; the load times are ridiculous and it seems the development team spent more time on making the game seem ""cool"" and not enough on actual game play. This is a HUGE step back from Amped's last release. The overly slick styling detracts from Amped 3, making it all filler without much else. Maybe this is what ten year olds expect from their video games, but I was extremely disappointed."
5,Fun Snowboarding Game,"When I first put in the game, I was like, ""Wow, this is gonna suck."" I only thought that though because the story and the video clips are ridiculously corny. But once I started playing, I realized that the game itself is a ton of fun with cool challenges and good snowboarding mechanics. The music soundtracks are great. If you like the style of snowboarding in SSX then you should like this game. I've beat the game, but I still don't fully understand the story because I skipped most of the video clips. They were to corny to bear. To sum it up this game is a HIPPIE STYLE SNOWBOARDING GAME. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed playing it."
4,Fun Game,"Got lured in by the demo. Game has lots of neat features and unlockable items, all accessable with cheat codes. Great soundtrack!!! Gameplay is nice and challenges are fun."
4,satisfied,amped 3 is good. thankful how swift it arrived. it was a gift and they are satisified with the game play.
4,Very easy controls a little to easy,Ok the first thing i want to say is that the guy Gregory T.schiller needs to be slapped first he gives Quak 4 a 1/5 which is a great game and now this one yeah sure this game is a little stupid with the wiener boy character and such but it is still a fun game and he did not play it i garanty you. The only problome with the game that i have is that the controls are a little to easy like when i try to hop over a box and then land on it and yea i know that is what tail bonk is for but still make it a little more chalenging. Pick up this game it is great.i am not under 13 i just dont want to get an account.
1,Amped: Doesn't Deserve X-Box 360 Status (Train Wreck),"I rented Amped 360 after reading the good reviews some people gave it. My analaysis ...Hardly worth renting, much less buying; especially compared to other games.Painfully long Load times and annoying appeal-to-7-year-old interface are hard to stomach.After getting through all of that nonsense ... the game is really 10 steps back from good snowboarding games like the SSX series (I really haven't played any others; there are probably dozens AT LEAST as good as SSX, if not better.Admittedly I didn't play Amped 360 for very long, but my first impressions were this is a train wreck that you'd be wise to avoid."
3,"Very gripping, somewhat hard to follow at times.","Great subject, good book, gripping at times with alot of action. However, I recommend reading the book over a short period of time. The auther did a nice job following the dozen or so boats involved in the storm ""but"" It was not easy to return to the book and recall your place following a short absence from reading it. I am a novice boater and was confused at some of the sailing terminology."
5,"Chilling and thought provoking, excellent journalism.","If you liked The Perfect Storm, this one will haunt your dreams with its first-hand accounts of terror, tragedy, bravery, heroism, determination, good luck, bad luck, bad planning, and bad judgment. Mr. Farrington made me care about all these real people and their little boats out on a big ocean. It was all I could do not to flip ahead to find out what happened to them all, even though this all happened years ago. You may never take your own safety for granted again. Most of us are desperately unprepared for a real storm at sea. I found this book to be a riveting wake-up call. I'm on a mission to know a lot more about weather, radio, safety gear and emergency procedures. Both I and my 38-foot ketch are already better fitted for survival than we used to be."
3,Fascinating; especially if you're into sailing,"The story of several crews and their rescue during a freak storm. Tough to read if you're not a sailor. I kept looking for the glossary, having never ""hove-to"" nor raised a ""trysail."" Somewhat of a surface analysis of the people-issues. Mostly technical... sailing and weather stuff. Lots of good advice for sailors who venture into similar conditions. (Tip #1: Paint your boat something other than white; it's too hard to see in a storm. Bright orange is recommended. Yeah, like that's going to happen."
1,I did not understand it!!,I think the only person that should read this is a person that loves or knows a lot about sailing. Even though the decreption was good I got really comfusid in the good parts of the book. Anyone that doesnt like or has no clue about sailing should not read this book!!
5,Excellent and informative two books in one.,"This book is actually two books in one. If you already own her Professional Portraiture book, you'll get the exact same book within the first half of this volume. But I still think it's worth purchasing for the Wedding section. Annabel offers a typical wedding scenario timeline from start to finish. She starts at the bride's house and finishes after the ceremony (she doesn't cover the reception unless requested by the couple). There's also a helpful page on the list of films she uses. A wealth of information with tons of stylish photos to prove Annabel's innovative talents."
3,More of a glorified portfolio,"This is a good book if you are looking to add a little high fashion and contemporary look to your photographs and are unsure about the subtleties of a photo shoot (how to relax your clients, pose, etc.). I am not a wedding photographer, as I mainly deal with children. I found her photographs somewhat inspiring. I am not a fan of cross processing film nor am I a fan of high speed black/white film. I found Williams' adherance to Provia 400 cross processed and Neopan 1600 limiting. I would have liked to have seen more range. I agree wholeheartedly with her preference for shooting in available light, hence the high speed film. If you're looking for a technical approach, you are not going to get it here. Overall, good book. There is nothing about digital here (just thought I would add that in case that is what you are looking for)."
1,Expresso Coffee,Kind of shocked that the coffee was the lightest roasted coffee I have ever had. Didnt even have that expresso taste.
2,Not what I expected,"This was a very light roasted coffee as such was packed with caffeine. Made the mistake to assume that a review stating this was Lavazza's stongest coffee meant darkest roast. On a positive note, there is no bitterness or sour acid after taste. I wish Lavazza would offer a dark bean at the level of a french or italian roast. So far I have tried the Gran Filtro Dark Roast, Grand Whole Bean and Qualita Oro with no luck."
5,Great casual shoe,"Great wide footbed. Nothing like a great looking casual shoe that fits better than your most comfortable sneaker... that's just out of the box. So far it's been great. Nice rugged look. goes great with jeans and khakis. The best thing I like about them is that they're tougher than other dress/casual type shoes I've had in the past. It gives me confidence that if I ever have to ""step on the gas"" in these things, I'm not gonna slip slide away and I don't have to worry about them falling apart..."
5,my favorite shoe ever!,"Well I just received my 2nd pair of keen Austin's in the mail yesterday(I also owna pair of keen finleys and keen slippers).Personally speaking these are the most comfortable brand of shoes ive ever owned.I am on my feet for 10 hours a day and roughly walk around 10 miles a day at my job.Also with previous shoes ive owned ive had some issues with foot odor but not with my keens.I really can not say enough good things about these shoes.If you have wide foot,are on your feet alot and want a extremely comfortable pair of shoes go pick a pair up!"
4,Great Shoes,"These are great shoes for my square-toed feet. The fact that they're waterproof is nice too, but mostly they're comfortable and durable."
4,Nice but not great pair of shoes,These shoes are comfortable and nice looking with one exception--the tongue is too short and hits on your foot at an odd place. Maybe once I've worn them for a while (and I plan to wear them alot) they'll break in and the tongue portion won't rest so hard against the top of my feet. Good color and they look good and generally I love Keen products.
2,Keen Austin 2.0,"I have the original Austin and I love that pair of shoes. These prove that original designs are often not improved; only made different. I don't think these fit as well as the originals, which were snug and took time to shape to my feet. These have a sloppy feel unless I lace them tightly. I wish I had not bought them."
3,"Comfy, Poor Quailty and Customer Support","Bought my first pair of these, and loved them. They where incredibly comfortable, and I raved about them to anyone who would listen. As another reviewer noted, they wore very well.I bought a second pair I loved them so much, and have been disappointed. After a couple months one shoe (left)started to squeek with every step; very loud and driving me crazy. I assume this is due to some internal separation between the sole and body of the shoe. In addition, the sole has started to separate from the body around the sides, also mentioned by a previous reviewer who owned multiple pairs.I emailed customer support multiple times, about the problems and never received a response.This is incredibly dissappointing, as I love the comfort and appearance of the shoes. However, in this day and age for a company to ignore obvious problems with products, and NOT to respond to loyal customers, means I will have to look elsewhere for my footwear in the future.Not recommended."
3,"Great fit, comfortable, poor construction","I was really excited by this shoe. First, it fits great, and pretty comfortable to walk around in. The heel is a little stiff, but you get used to it and it's supportive.Unfortunately, I have to dock the shoe 2 stars because of the very poor construction. They were only waterproof for about a 2 weeks under light wear when the rubber edge of the shoe started separating. Even walking in low wet grass started allowing wetness in and my socks routinely got wet. Maybe I got a bad pair and the glue was old. Separation after 2 weeks though is unacceptable for a shoe this price. It has continued to separate and so has become only a summer shoe. Too bad because I think it's a comfy, great looking shoe; unfortunately it has dimmed by view of Keen shoes and I will likely hesitate if not outright avoid buying another pair of this brand."
3,Not the best value for your money,"These shoes are just ok. In fact, for the money, you could find higher quality and nicer looking shoes. They are quite comfortable. They arrived a couple days late and one show had a scratch on the leather, as if it had already been worn. Overall, I'm less than impressed."
1,Shoe prices are misleading,"Funny how shoes that are in stock are price at the regular price and shoes that are out of stock are ""on sale"" at a special price. This is true no matter what size your view.This is clearly a contrived plan to give the impression of a low price when shoes that are in stock are never actually sold at that price.This is a very poor practice, and I don't like to feel like I'm being tricked."
3,Good product,Nice product but the pair that I got was not in very good shape. The right shoe shape was different and bit smaller than the left shoe!!
5,Best fit and comfort!,"Love these shoes! 2nd pair and they fit just like the trekkers. They are comfy and supportive and look great too, business casual. Couldn't be happier!"
1,Didn't stay together.,Great looking shoe and very comfortable. The problem is the the left shoe's leather upper has started to separate from the sole in a big way. Obviously the glue did not bond. The shoe is less than a month old. They're on their way back to Amazon as I write this.
4,Fits the husband's wide foot.,"I purchased this shoe for my husband to wear on the bus to and from work. They keep his feet warm and dry during our wet Seattle winter, fit his wide feet, have good arch support, and good traction on wet concrete. He normally wears a 7.5, and the Keen's are true to size. He says the tongue is a bit long and is uncomfortable pressing on the top of his foot, so he skips lacing up the top hole."
4,Liking the Keen,Comfortable shoe once broken in. Should last quite a while being worn daily for work. Good arch support and still getting used to after one week of wearing.
5,Felicitades,"Muchas felicidades Nahyra y su produccion DE VUELTA AL SABOR. Eres una de pilares fuerte de la musica tropical (salsa). Tiene mucho talento artistico y como ser humano ni se diga. Sigue adelante. De apoya tu fanatico numero uno (1)y tu amigo de siempre, Juan Antonio"
3,THIS IS FOR KIDS!!,Looked like a great book. Unfortunately we didn't realize it was a kids book so we sent it back for the Old Tippecanoe book.
3,it was just ok,I did not like the manner in which the book was written it wanderd to much.and strayed mabe it was just me I could not follow the french view.
3,"Kodiak &#65533; Surrounded 1 Good, albeit short, progressive set","Ignore the fact that unless you're a truly hardcore music enthusiast you won't recognize any of the artists here except The Light, a production team whom Kodiak belongs to. Actually, don't ignore that, as the strength of Surrounded is that these eleven quality cuts are therefore unlikely to pop up on more mainstream sets.Thankfully, someone is finally taking a lighter approach to progressive house, as the chime-filled ""Intro,"" Eastern inflected (and way too short) ""Persian Excursion"" and sprightly ""The Score"" by DJ Hal will attest. ""Phantom"" proves the only clunker of the bunch, plodding to a monotonous beat with irritating squiggle sounds throughout.Unfortunately, at just 54 minutes long there's not enough material to enrapture the listener like a good progressive set should."
1,Terrible,"This movie was a complete letdown. They tried to cross Cujo with The Terminator. Interesting concept, but the script completely lacks any real oomph. Awful film. Lance Henriksen deserved better."
1,Hollywood trash at animal's expense,"This film just goes to show that when Hollywood wants to make money they turn everyone into a tramp. This happened to all involved in ""Friend"" (hardly an appropriate title). I only hope the ASPCA stepped in sometime and sued because of animal cruelty and the film's promoting of the perpetuation of cruelty to animals. And I hope writer/director John Lafia is real proud of himself. He just sent the need for and recognition of animal rights back to the stone age. Only redeming factor was Lance Henriksen's work. He did the best with what he had to work with as usual."
4,SUPER KILLER MONSTER DOG!...,"MAN'S BEST FRIEND is one of those kooky movies best described as a bizarre cross between CUJO and BEETHOVEN (CUJO-VEN??), w/ as many goofy characters and slapsticky moments as there are bloody ones! The plot is sort of an R-rated SHORT CIRCUIT w/ a super dog instead of a zany robot. We even get Ally Sheedy as the heroine! Lance Henriksen spends his screen time looking angry, and William Sanderson plays an eeevil junkyard owner! MBF is great for an evening of mindless movie fun. I am especially fond of the cat-swallowing scene! It's pure genius!..."
4,Solely bought it for the dog.,"Okay so it's not a large blockbuster, but I solely bought this movie for the dog. Our friends raise Tibetan Mastiffs (in case you were wondering what breed of dog the REAL Max was), and so we had to get this movie.I found myself cheering for the dog 90% of the movie."
4,they should have named it Jurrasic dog!,It was a good movie there is a scene that will have cat haters rolling on the floor!
2,4th Symphony is not bad here,"This CD is worth to check for 4th Symphony. All in all, there are no really good performances of this symphony on CD.For Grand Duet it's better to check Rostropovich's version (sorry, but it's on the 13 CDs box-set ""the Russian Years"").Trio is performed well by Lubimov or de Leeuw, but not by the Barton Workshop.Frank Denyer is one of the best performers of the Piano Sonatas (there's a CD with all 6 of them).So his version of the 5th sonata is good, but you should know that the 5th is particularly well played as well by de Leeuw."
1,Real bad,"This is a must NOT have for anyone who has any regard for Ustvolskaya's music, as well as for those who are about to sample it for a first time. I listened to the Grand Duet first, and could not force myself to hear any of the rest. Sorry to say this, but it sounds like these guys have NO idea what they are dealing with... It's like they hate the music and would like to convince the rest of the world how bad it is (which is far from being the case!). So far, the only recording I have heard that has the true Ustvolskaya spirit is Natalia Gutman's."
2,Good history; poor quality -,"This video had some great history on it and a lot of footage of MLK in settings where I didn't normally see him. But the quality of a lot of the footage was bad. It wasn't because it was old footage either because I've seen a lot of the same footage on other videos with much better quality. For the price I paid for this ($28.48), the quality was disappointing. It also could have used a lot more dialogue and depth added to the footage that was used. There are other choices of MLK history videos out there which I would suggest people seek out before settling on this one."
4,love it but pages fall easily,"love it, its really interesting and fun but pages fall so easily. i would recomend to buy a hard cover version if it exist to avoid the pages problem."
5,Great Christmas CD,"This is a CD that I had been unable to find anywhere. Originally I had the tape. It was a family Christmas favorite. Delivery was quick, condition great, and it was so good to finally replace the tape that I could no longer play because all we have now are CD players. Very good experience! Thanks so much."
4,Saved my life (and my grade),"When enrolled in AP Calculus AB in high school, I found myself struggling. Often, even after understanding a concept, I would have difficulty doing the problems in the homework. I found that the example problems we did in class and in the book were often insufficient and I often wished for more example problems. This book was extremely helpful because it is nothing but example problems, and so it was perfect for me. It is a great resource for reinforcing concepts learned in class, helping with homework, studying for tests, etc.I am, however, compelled to agree with the reviewer that more detailed explanations of the problems could have been helpful in many cases (this is why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5). I would, however, still recommend this book to anyone taking calculus. In some cases, the fact that they don't explain the problems is good because it forces you to ""work through"" the problems and figure out why they did each step and what each step was doing."
4,Use with Calc 1-2,"The title says it all. It is a great resource for problems in calc 1 and 2. I used it because my book (Stewart) lacked sufficient example problems, and this book is basically all example problems. After you get the basics of the problem down after a while, you can work through the problems on your own, and it is very convenient that the answers are right there on the same page.The shortfall of this book is lack of material relating to calc 3. For a different supplement, I recommend schaum's Vector Analysis, written by Spiegel.Overall, this book is pretty good. Worth the money if you are struggling and need more examples, or if you would like a challenge because your class is boring you to death."
2,good concept but book falls short,"This book sounds like a great idea, and to a student considering whether to get this or a more traditional book, I would recommend a book like The Complete Idiot's Guide to Calculus by W. Michael Kelley.You will probably have plenty of problems at your disposal in a calc class, so ones from Schaums don't necessarily correlate to what the professor is teaching. Furthermore there are many steps, but not always enough, and no explanations. I think it would be better to have 1000 problems with discussion rather then 3000 crammed in tiny print with bad formatting. That's the final qualm with this book, it is printed on poor quality paper and the ink is thick and the print is small and really crammed in there. Not what you need when there are so many sub and super scripts."
5,Fantastic Supplement,I have recently returned to school to complete a Masters program in Economics - Quantitative Finance. This book has been invaluable in giving step by step solutions to problems at all levels of difficulty. I highly recommend it!
3,small font,"It's perfect because it solves out problems completely and it gives a good outline of what you're supposed to do for each problem, but it's not very spaced out and the font is small, making it not very user friendly. But if you have the patience, it's perfect!"
4,"Great review, but you should know the material first.",".... Its got a lot of good problems in it although i have found some mistakes... but truth is it contains the advanced problems that you teacher/professor is definitely going to put on the test. If you used to studying and then being put to shame on tests this is for you.!!!!!WARNING!!!!!IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY KNOW CALCULUS THIS BOOK IS NOT A GOOD SOURCE FOR STUDY. You should make sure to get a instructional book if your a newer calc. student along with this one. If your looking for a good instructional book to go along with this (thats about 15 dollars), ""Humongous book of calculus"" is a great buy and has helped me more than any other calc. book, BUT this calc problems book is great for advanced students how want more practice(which the instructional book wont give you)."
1,No equals signs,"I only have the sample of the first chapters but it is clear that it is not adequately formatted for the kindle, with equals signs simply missing...if they can't format a maths book for the price it just shouldnt be published."
4,Great calculus book,Great calculus book. The only area of weakness is Limits of Trigonometric functions. Great companion for AP Calculus. Your fundamental concepts in Calculus will definitely improve.
4,Great practice book!,This was a great help in my Calculus 2 class in College. I loved going through problems and being able to check my answers. A MUST for anyone taking calculus that might need extra help or practice!
2,Chipmunks on Helium,"I hate to down any music because I am a fan of many diferent genres BUT...I put this disk in my 300 disk player and press play and experience something quite new. Have you ever heard the Chipmunks on helium? Well not exactly a relaxing experience. I had purchased this disk because I was on a search for the song ""Queen Bee"". I found it by Barbra Streisand but I thought someone else had done it before her. In my search I came across Middle of the road. I had never heard of them before (I am 30 years old) so I decided, because I could not find a soundclip anywhere, to order the disk and take a chance. Well needless to say I hope the ""random"" on my player skips this disk as much as possible. The music has a nice folksy feel but the vocals scare me. Just my opinion..."
1,I do not recommend this video at all.,"I was shocked to see the poor techniques used in this video. The music is annoyingly loud, Ms. Bylund is annoyingly loud, and her techniques are so poor that I can't believe she's a certified black belt instructor. I have taught martial arts for many years (and boxing aerobics for several months now) and I would not recommend this particular video to any of my students. Thumbs definitely down!"
2,"Looks great, but....","We play a lot of volleyball, and after our $15 Wilson started shredding, we opted to purchase something a bit better. We got it quick, but quickly realized this thing is durable for a reason...it's hard! Our team complained instantly, and we're searching for the next level up (requiring more $$)."
1,"Originally free sales pamphlet, not a book",This is misrepresented as a book. it is not a book. it is 9.5 x 21cm #7813 41 pp. pamphlet. Dealers that represent this as a book may be less than honest and give you problems.
1,Ditto,"I bought this a couple years ago. Half the music on this CD has nothing to do with Halloween. Whatever happend to 'Thriller', 'Werewolves of London' and other timeless classics? They are not on this CD."
2,Yuk,"Ditto to what everyone else said. The songs are all remakes, (poor ones at that) and many of the songs on this CD do not belong on a halloween track. I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for a good Halloween CD. But it's decent if you like Disco."
2,it's ok,"This is not the best Halloween Party music, butI guess it's ok. I just don't think that you should buy this CD, you won't get your money's worth!"
3,a bit of frustration,"Normally I have had no problems with First Alert alarms; but the cover on this one was hard to remove, in order to mount it. The plastic ring was so thin that I was afraid if I forced it, it would break, finally after putting it aside a couple times to stop my frustration I was able to get it together ready to mount, which also seemed more awkward than other alarms I have put up, including another CO2/smoke alarm I purchased at the same time.The good is the button to turn off the alarm for smoky kitchens and also the use of regular batteries rather than having to hunt down more expensive lithium ones."
1,.......Do Not Buy This One,"This is the worst device I've ever used (I have the model SA 303.) It has the ""swing-out"" door to load the battery. Difficult to install. The battery died, and I couldn't figure out how to replace the battery. My advice is do not buy this model of smoke detector."
4,Good for the money,"I have no complaints. I bought this sometime ago and it came with the battery and was easy to install. I also like the fact that when I need to replace the battery, I simply just pull the lever to the side against taking the whole thing off the ceiling. Again, for the price its an excellent buy."
1,One-time Use ONLY,"Attempting to replace batteries on multiple units revealed a design that simply would not allow removal and replacement of the 9v battery. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN, as other models installed were all easily replaceable!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,It's just a waste of money - the case cracks VERY easily. I had to take it off my phone nearly 1 week after I bought it. Not worth it at all! Save your money!
4,A good place to start,"You know you need to know more about Mergers and Acquisitions. The question is where do you start. For many the answer is Mergers & Acquisitions from A to Z.Another book on this subject that is well recieved is:Mergers and Acquisitions Basics : The Key Steps of Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments."
3,Ultimately rather self-indulgent and silly,"....I enjoyed reading this novel in Spanish, and while I have still a lot to learn, I could understand the writing and the style quite easily. While the writing is often witty and humorous, the shallowness and selfishness of the protagonists began to grate and I found myself losing interest in them and their fate. Maybe Jaime Bayly could write something less (apparently) autobiographical and self-indulgent, and find a different topic (gay themes are great, but accounts of gay life alone are not enough for a great novel)- in my opinion."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,My 3 1/2 year old daughter is mesermized by this video. It's funny and sweet and the whole family enjoys watching it. Definately worth buying. I only wish Joe had more videos out.
4,El último de la saga,"Una saga que animó los 90s, éste es el último disco de la saga y contiene 4 cds + 1 cd-rom. Aunque contiene covers, contiene nuevamente un megamix."
2,"Unfortunately, very dull","This Harlequin romance has a bit more depth than some, but unfortunately, the basic plot (heroine, dumped by fiance, meets new boss & finds new attraction) is not very interesting. Nor are the characters very original. The hero is rather the controlling type, brusque and rude to the heroine in order to hide his feelings, but hiding a heart of gold, - which I find tiresome.The heroine is not an entire doormat, but you get the sense that she's just barely missing being one. A couple of times early in the story, the hero actually and unjustifiably calls her stupid, and she decides to resign her job but never follows through. Believe me, all my boss would have to do is call me stupid ONCE and I'd be out of there. I tried not to let the lack of realism in this tale bother me -- after all, when you read a Harlequin, you pretty much have to put any hope for realism aside -- but, in this case, I just couldn't do it."
1,Incredibly Bad,"I like most books, even the ones that not well written. If it is a good, entertaining yarn I can get past workman prose. Sadly, Thomas O'Callaghan's ""The Screaming Room"" is simply bad. The book reads like an abridged version of ideas from other, better books.To disguise the fact that the book is devoid of any interesting angle, the author ups the shock factor. Incest? Check. Child rape? Check. Racism? Check. Scalping? Check.We get that inserted in strong passages like this one describing a child finding the first murder victim in a museum.""Isn't the plateosaurus a plant eater?""""Of course it is.""The boy pointed his finger at the assemblage of bones.""Then how come that one's got a dead lady coming out of its butt?""Run far away from this one. Literally any other thriller you could pick up would be better."
1,Dreck,Ditto Matthew Erwin's 1-star review; this one is a real stinker for all the reasons Mr. Erwin noted. My impression is that Mr. O'Callaghan is a competent writer with some interesting ideas who is badly in need of a better editor.
4,From the Heart,"As a man I was please to have read a book written by a man that did not give into the typical masculine stereotype. I'm very proud of Bernard Henry for writing For All We Know, because it gives the reader a true perception of the struggle that men endure, but sometimes cannot express. Without being too soft, the author was able to capture an real essence of a man dealing with sensitive issues, such as love, commitment, and most of all - life. Bernard Henry does a wonderful job in creating a world of family and close friends, who you become a part of as the story unwinds. With the strength of a man's perception and the insightful and touching elements of the heart, For All We Know is a must read for everyone."
4,Adventure in New Zealand by E.J. Wakefield,I found this book to be easy reading and very descriptive of the life and times in New Zealand circa 1840. It describes the authors interpretation of the interaction between the Maoris and the Europeans during the time of colonization. It is actually a slightly abridged version (2 volumes made into 1) which is probably a good thing for most of the readers. I think the author has a very definite agenda and this clearly affects the writing. He seems to be defending himself from perceptions about him that must have existed at that time and the book also appears to be a marketing tool for the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the New Zealand Company
3,Interesting information source,"...There is a great deal of information here. I have to give it to the author - a lot of work went into writing this book. I would think this book would be more suited to the serious reader and not the idly curious. Professionals in Accounting, Tax, Estate Planning and the like will find this a great reference book."
4,as kewl as the orignal.,"TCM3 had better scenes than the original but wasnt asauthentic as the first one. Since these movies keep statingthat sally hardesty survived the masacre back in 1973, I still wonder if the is any truth about this whole story. I recommend this movie for anyone who is not eaisly squimish. I only wrote this online review because I went to high school in souhtern california with the character who played the little girl, ""jennifer banko"" who also played in other movies."
2,Aload of ? !,"I bought thnking i waz in for a real good movie it turns out that i was wrong the movie is really poor,the characters have no good dialogue or background the only good thing to get out of these movie's is that Leatherface is cool to watch because a different person plays him in every movie and he get's slimer everytime and worse at the role but this was better than number two in the frightening way but i think people should think about renting before buying."
4,Differences between 'R' rated and 'rated' version,"Regarding the above title, there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the Dvd. There seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the USA and the UK as they do very little to the film's context. Still, it's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore (if that's what you're into) and I'd still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10."
2,Not bad but....,"This movie would be good if you haven't seen any of the other movies. First of all where the hell did thisd family come from? Second of all this family was not nearly as wierd as the first family. Third, is it trying to be a horror or a comedy? Granted, it was entertaining and fun. But if you are a true Texas Chainsaw fan don't watch this movie."
2,i did not like it that mutch,i baught this dvd of leatherface the texas chainsaw massacre 3 at best buy. and i watched both of the documentaries and the alternate ending. and when i finished watching it i was kinda scared by some of the scenes. so later when i whent to bed i had to sleep with the light on and the tv on. and i was awake in bed until almost six oclock in the a.m. so it might be a while before i stick this disk in my dvd player. and i will probubly aventully sell it.
2,SO SO,"This is the only entry in the series that I can stand. It's the usual jargon, but it has a nice touch of black humor. That's the only thing to keep you interested in this film. This series sucked from the start."
1,"wait, what...i missed it?","baaaaad movie....baaaad! lol its just so...bad...its kind of a spoof of itself...the story is so weak and the acting is so bad and theres no music! music is what makes a movie! music adds to the horror of a good horror movie...which this is definatly not! You barely see leatherface, and when u do see him, he doesnt even use his chainsaw!no one will miss this movie...NO ONE!"
4,Still Holds High in the Series,"Even though this marks the third entry into the ""Chainsaw"" series, it still holds its ground. I'd have to say even with Tobe Hooper not involved it still did very well in originality. You get a new family, a new batch of victims, and a new taste of humor mixed with horror. Not to mention, a new and improved saw! R.A. Mihailoff pulls off a really good Leatherface, giving him a whole new personality, not to mention a much scarier looking mask then the ones from the two previous films. The family is both humorous and sadistic and will keep your attention throughout the movie. When you go to the video store and pick up the first two, be sure to get this one as well to watch for the sheer humor and fun!"
4,A picture deprived of evolution,"I loved the first one, the whole concept, and just the all around atmosphere. and i didnt think to highly of the second one. but the 3rd one aint so bad, just needs to be some evolving in the whole picture. in fact, horror movies need evolution. now, this movie is rather demented as the previous 2 were, and its quite jumpy, as in, ""come on, run you fool, hes righ behind you..."" you get the picture. but, i just wish they could have done more. expanded the horizons of the whole set up, you know, have a new mind set on how things are done. i mean, i like this movie, but its just kind of the same thing, but a little better than the second one. i do reccomend this to all horror fans, and just watch it and sit back and enjoy. it is quite enjoyable, and none of the flaws get in the way of a good saturday night flick with the ol' ball and chain. peace out!!"
1,Defective,"The DVD doesn't play, the case doesn't look like the actual DVD case and the DVD reads REGIONAL ERROR when you try to play it."
4,chainsaw massare 3,"watched it at thearther it was great it was nice that i watched a scary movie it was,nt that bad it scade me whell he sawed everyone well he did his job."
3,"It's good, but in my opinion NOT a sequal","I saw the last half of this uncut, Then I saw the whole film in its cut version. I have to tell ya me and my sister were grossed out ( definately not a film to eat pizza while watching). The story hase really nothing to do with the last 2,(beside there being a crazed family) but it does still deliver some scares. The film was produced by the same producers of a Nightmare On Elm St. Which all the more made me want to go see it (I am a huge Freddy fan), but dont let that fool you into beliveing that this is a worthy ""sequal"" it's just another cheezy gore fest. I give this film 3 stars for having some realation to the last 2 and delivering noticeable scares that #2 faild to give."
4,Leatherface - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,"A friend of mine got me to watch this movie a few years back and I enjoyed it a lot,I haven't seen the TCM films in some time.We watched this movie many times and would enjoy going back and forth saying lines,Tex(Viggo Mortensen)would have to be my favorite character in the film and it was this film that made me a fan of his.Anyway,I just wanted to say if you haven't seen this film,take it from me...see it if you're a TCM fan you may enjoy the wackiness of the characters.Tex: Whaddaya think about our little lady?Tinker: ...Uncertain. Looks like she might get all screamy on us Eddie.Tex: [Slams meat cleaver on table] I wish you'd call me Tex. I told you.Tinker: Oh I'm sorry boy. Dammit, I'm sorry... how'd you like to do us the honor of plugging her up?(i'm pretty sure i got the quote right)"
5,Highly Entertaining,"I know the first TCM is considered a classic, and I do love it, but the first 3/4 of the film is BORING. The 2nd TCM is uneven at best(though frequently quite funny). The 4th one is the worst piece of filth ever shot out onto the screen. That leaves part 3 as the best in the series. It is never boring, it has great atmosphere, it has better than average acting, and it has a sense of humor about itself. It has been said the the lack of gore in the original release of part 3 makes the film unwatchable. How much gore was in the first film? Almost none if I remember correctly. Well, if you listen to all those who unjustly pan this film, you're going to miss out on a real gem."
1,"GOOD LORD, THIS MOVIE IS BAD","The first TCM is a horror classic. This one is a piece of trash, through-and-through. Who is this Leatherface guy? Surely, it can't be the same Leatherface from the original. Unless, of course, he shrank in height, lost a little weight, dyed his hair, and didn't age. The dialogue is horrible at best, the acting is atrocious, and the direction is a travesty. The film tries to have a sense of humor. It doesn't work. With Leatherface chasing his prey in a truck, heavy-metal music blasting (of course, his own theme song), the film is unintentionally hilarious. It looks like a made-for-TV horror crap flick. I hear that the uncut version is very gory; I find it hard to believe, and even if it is, the unintentional hilarity of the movie will keep you from being frightened. Don't bother with this turkey. Two very unenthusiastic thumbs down, WAY DOWN!!"
1,Too fake,I couldn't finish watching it. It's a b rated movie typical lit of screamin fake blood stupid costumes nothing like the first one
4,TCM 3,"This seemingly shameless 1989 prequel to the 1974 classic and it's extremely fun 1986 sequel boxoffice flop, is quite a film. I really can't stand the high leveled sickness of the cannibal family in part 4, but this one is somewhat lighter and it is entertaining and may I dare say, semi scary. The gore was high on the unrated version and the ending was good for that kind of movie, but I feel the script, acting and true horror were all lacking. Although very atmospheric, most of the movie isn't really that scary, although a few genuine scares lift it back up///This A quality DVD sure makes you see a better side of the movie, with deleted scenes, restored and all, I really think TCM 3 is worth horror fan's time with at least a rental, and If you hated it the first time around, give it another chance with this new DVD, I did, and I used to hate it, now, it's decent..."
3,More like a remake of the original,"Leatherface is back - and with a new family who feasts on those unfortunate enough to veer off the beaten path. A survivalist (Ken Foree) and two travelers (William Butler & Kate Hodge) fight for survival after falling into their nasty clutches. Nothing great but not a total loss, Ken Foree (Dawn Of The Dead) is very watchable and the film picks up speed during the second half, but nothing really scary. I find all the opening prologues in this series curious: Not only do they all say something different, but I've never heard of these crimes to begin with. Unlike Part 2, this was cut prior to release. Hopefully a director's cut will be offered eventually."
2,purely for fans,"this one is purely for fans and Leatherface is back in action. but it doesnt surpass the other 2. look close for Viggo Mortensen. wallops in familiar turf. if only Tobe Hooper directed it, then it would be good, but like I said, fo the fans"
3,"Horror movie, yeah right...","This movieserie [stinks] more and more each time a new movie comes out... I never really liked any of these movies (except part 2 wich was a lil' hillarious)... The plot, acting and scares [stinks]! I almost snorred trough the entire movie! So, why am i giving this movie a 3 stars? Cause of some small cool parts here and there in the movie..."
3,The Funniest of all the TCM's,You have to give this movie one thing:An unintentional sense of humor.I mean that gas station attendant guy(Alfredo) is just funny I can't help but laugh whenever he opens his mouth.But it was pretty stupid like that demented little girl who couldn't act to save her life and the director was biased by casting a family member to play a crap role in a crap movie that was saved only by Alfredo.
5,One of the best sequels in the TCM series,"I have only this to say....ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS EVER!!!!WOOO-HOOOOO! people who did not like this movie really just don't get it. And people complain that it has no connection to the first two films. Well....IF YOU USE YOUR F***ING IMAGINATION YOU COULD COME UP WITH A WAY!! Anyway, I Love this film and its the last one I need to finish my TCM collection!the end."
1,Bad movie.....,"I don't get what people saw in this movie. The plot moved too slowly, there was zero suspence, and low gore factor. This was a total disappointment because my expectations were raised due to this being an ""unrated edition"", and it failed to deliver across the board. Save your money, not even rental worthy."
2,Wasn't as good as the original or 2,This film didn't live to the hype...Very Overrated..I thought the Original was very creepy but this was alright..Leather faced looked horrible...Thats a bad thing..He looked stupid too.I thought the plot was dull...Kina stupid...The characters were alright....The overall film was alright...Didnt do that good....I give it 2/5 stars...Very bad movie...Later..
2,ohh dear satan...,"i have to be honest here..i was at sleep doing this film because it was to boring..i mean...what a pice of s**t...bad leatherface bad!....i think a day with my younger sister playing with Toy horses would scare my more that this flick....well..if you need something to sleep on,i got a perfect idea..buy this film and nighty night!...okey let me be fair now....i think there was 1 or 2 scenes i liked..but it's over the top..there is no real meaning with the storyline..it'a wacked...and i was bored.."
2,All right,Some light comedy helps break up the terror in this story of two travelers who make the mistake of stoping in texas for directions.Not as scary as the first film and not as bloodly as the second.
3,The worst massacre ever made.,"First off this movie makes me want to vomit. I am being so nice by giving the movie 3 stars. I wanted to see it so bad yet when i say it i wish i didnt. 1,2,4 our much much more creative and does not loose your interest. But there is no massacre movie better then the first. Plus, in the movie if u have seen 1 and 2 there is so much confusion. I wonder if the leatherface is the same leatherface, and how did he get a new family. There was a very young child in the movie probably 7 years old it was so nasty to see a little girl in a massacre movie. You would be better off getting the first"
1,disjointed...,"Sadly, it could have and should have been something...instead it is nothing more than a mess.Joe Unger and the actor who played the perverted gas station attendant with the white film over one eyeare very good. This, however, is hardly enough to recommend the flick."
5,Awesome Item...Awesome Seller,Excellent Seller...Item arrived in perfect shape a day earlier than it was supposed to.I'd recommend this item and seller to everyone.
2,Definitely NOT heavy duty,"unless perhaps you were referring to a trash can. This is thin enough to be very ""dentable"", but since it's sole purpose was for Low Country Boils and would not have to handle hot oil, I probably would have kept it had the handles been functional. But alas, the handle welder dude set the angle on one of the handles to insure fingers could not get by it. I will go back to a truly HD stock pot for about the same money."
4,Great product!!!,This is a must buy. Cooked two turkeys over the holidays. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the description online said the pot could hold a 22lbs bird and the manual says do not exceed 18lbs bird. Overall great product!
2,not upgradable if you have Studio8 package,I tried to use Flash CS3 upgrade which did not work. After I called Adobe CS and asked them why. They told me SORRY you can not upgrade one items from a package as Studio8 . You need to buy a full version. I could not return the package since it was opened software package. I sold it online but lost $60 . Thanks to Adobe.
3,valuable but missing a few things,"I was very pleased to find this book, as it is one of the only readily obtainable sources of Yemenite Jewish teachings, which seem to be very rare. In perusing the book I was disappointed to find that there is not one note referencing the source words in the text or their tongue. Not one Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Aramaic, Syriac word in context. This would make this book totally invaluable. I find the anglicizing of words equivalent to dumbing down of research to a reader seeking rather rarified information such as this. This is JMHO."
4,Don't Overlook This Album,"I was first introduced to Vanessa Rubin listening to this project. It was her first as far as I know but it is quite good even now. If you can get a copy, please check it out."
5,moody???,this product actually works great for the hormonal moods that come with pms.. i love irwin naturals! Fast shipping
1,Came as Shards of Glass,"When I got this in the mail, I never thought this would happen. When I opened the box, it looked fine, since it LOOKED like it was packaged correctly. Unfortunately, when I took the bubble wrap off, the bottle broke into pieces, which left a mess of Estropause pills covered in tiny glass shards mixed with a couple more bigger sized shards that made my kitchen a dangerous area to walk into. Not only that, the bottle gave me a huge cut on my finger that wouldn't stop bleeding for an hour. I knew that in-taking one of those pills could be lifetaking, seeing how many small shards were in that pile of pills. I deserve a replacement bottle and/or a complete refund. I do NOT recommend buying from these people, since it might happen to you too."
5,Amazingly Amazing,This is the best dvd concert i ever saw the concert its awesome and the three music vids make it better go ahead and buy it believe me you will enjoy it
4,True enough to form,"To be honest, as a true musician, Destiny's Child's music isn't all that great from the instrumentalistic musical standpoint. However, Robert Bacon (Musical Director, guitars) and his band: Maurice Firzgerald, bass guitar (Fred Hammond, John P. Kee, T.D. Jakes), Khari Parker, drums, Bennett Paysinger and Freddie Moffett (keyboards), did a good job of mixing things up and keeping the sets rolling. I am with those who say that Kelly's hair looks like she just woke up and went on stage (it seems to be important so I thought I'd give my feedback on that). This is a CD for DC fans, the songs were pretty true to form. Nothing they changed was detrimental. Bandwise, this is worth it's space in your collection. Recorded vocals were playing alongside the live vocals, but who doesn't do that nowadays? (Well, Earth Wind and Fire doesn't). In fact, for a group with only three members, it could have spelled disaster not to feature the recorded vocals. Great video overall."
3,I love DC!,DC those are my girls and the concert was okay. Beyonce looked like she was tired but still gave a good performance. I have seen them perform with alot more energy. It was an entertaining DVD. I liked the ending when they sang Happy Face. I wanted to cry b/c I was feeling down at the time and you have to put on a happy face. I liked how they had the little kids on stage singing and dancing with them. That was great.
4,Worth it,"I had to buy this in college and it was torture for homework assignments. However, it is now enjoying a second life as the most useful text I have as an art teacher. (Aside from my art history books of course.)"
3,Misquoting of latin-american artists raise doubts...,"I've purchased this book while beeing in New York in 2003, and my first impression was that I had aquired an excellent and almost encyclopedical resourse for research. However, when looking for references on familiar contemporary artists like Brazilian Lygia Clark (one of the most important and internationally renowed creators, having teached in Sorbonne, among other things) I've found her name misquoted as ""Lydia Clark"" while she's reffered as ""Argentinian"" in the index. The fact that I've found such a mistake concerning a familiar name raises doubts on the rigor of this interesting work.Sérgio Basbaum (teacher at Universidade Cátólica, So Paulo, Brazil)"
2,Not enough coherence,"Although the list of artists is impressive, the entries by each are often so short that no coherent thought surfaces. It takes a very skilled interviewer or fantastic didactic vision on the part of the artist to arrive at a genuinely insightful piece of writing, like ""On Art"" by Rodin [excellent]. Also fairly good are David Sylvester's interviews of Bacon and others.Many of the entries in this book are meant to actually BE THE ART. Such writings can be interesting, but often fail, falling into a category of minimalist authorship. I found this book did not aid my search for profundity and revelation with regard to the artistic process."
5,Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings,This text is an excellent source of literary material that allows insight of the philosophies and worldviews of renown artists. I am very pleased with the text and plan to keep it in my library as a resource and insightful reading.
1,Very Disappointing,"This toy looked like fun in the store, but it is a HUGE letdown. Unfortunately, I couldn't test it in the store because the cheap batteries the company puts in there were dead. So I thought I'd give it a shot anyway and just put in my own batteries and try it at home...in hopes that it would be cute enough to give to my son for Christmas. I was extremely disappointed. The sound effects and music are LOUD. Usually, I am not bothered by the loudness of toys...but this toy was really ridiculous!! Plus, I thought that the microphone part was just that, a microphone where you would hear your voice coming through. It's not. It's totally fake. That is the best part for a child (my child, anyway)to hear his/her voice coming through. So what's the point to having a ""microphone"" that doesn't do anything? I gave this toy 1 star only because there is not an option for NO STARS. This toy is going back to the store today."
1,Let Down,My problem/compalaint with this microphone is the static. I guess the speaker is too close to the microphone and causes feedback and static. My kids can't hear themselves sing over the noise and it is VERY annoying to anyone around them.I didn't look up this microphone on Amazon.com before buying it. I REALLY wish I had. I love Amazon.com reviews--real people tell it how it is.
1,Not happy,"This toy was only manufactured in Jun 04. I bought this toy for my 4 1/2 year old son and knew he would love it - and he did. However, this week the top, metal, mesh covering has come away and exposed sharp metal ends. It is just as though the glue they used to bind the top to the middle has failed. I have contacted little tikes consumer site to let them know -- however, I did not get much of a response but thought others should know before they part with their money. It was a fantastic toy and the features of the lights and musical effects were great -- however, after only having it for less than four months and to now have a useless, and dangerous, piece of plastic has left us not so happy. Buyer beware!"
2,Battery problem,"I bought this for my son at Christmas. Although he loves the toy, it has a battery problem. At first I thought it was the batteries I was using so kept changing them out, but then realized that the batteries move just slightly off the connectors while in the toy which causes the toy not to work. Very annoying to have to keep making sure the battery is pushed in to get the toy to work."
1,Do NOT buy this junk,"1. The microphone barely works, i.e. the amplification is minimal. The 2cent microphone/amplifier on the $1 cach register toy we have works better.2. The microphone is not powered by pressing a button, but rather has an on/off switch. This of course leads to immediate accidental battery drain, b/c who can possibly reliably turn the thing off after your 3 yr old is done playing with it.So basically you get one or two uses out of it and then you need to replace the batteries. And the one or two uses you get are frustrating b/c the amplification is so weak/nonexistant.ToysRUs is doing everyone a disservice by carrying this battery-purchase-generator."
1,A Waste...,"I got one at BigLots, thinking it was a deal for $10. It's not. We got the Parents one at Target instead. Can't comment on that one yet, as my wife is bringing it home now. That one seems to be the best deal vs. features for this type of product. I agree 100% with the other negative reviews posted here about this Little Tikes product."
1,Didn't work,Gave this as a gift to my sister's granddaughter and it did not work. Batteries were not an issue how do I return?
1,"Worst ""Microphone"" Made","Do not buy this product. It should not be called a microphone as it has 0 amplification. Sure, it is colorful and cute, and looks like a microphone, but that is about it. Even the ""sing along"" part is a rip off. What is more, the mesh part of the microphone comes off easily, and when it does, it has ragged sharp points that can hurt children. The product, for that reason, should be taken off shelves. Try the Elmo Sing A Long product, which is kid friendly and acts much more like a microphone."
2,not very durable,The Mike is really cool and very much like the real thing but the wire mesh is coming apart and is very sharp-Bought last year for my 4 year old.
1,One of the cheapest toys ever made!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and it stopped working just a few days later. When I opened it up to change the batteries there was acid all over the place and one of the batteries looked as if it had exploded. Even after my father-in-law and I fixed it up and added new batteries and cleaned the connections it still failed to work. Nothing. No response. So, Little Tikes should probably stick to plastic toys without the electronics. Avoid this item."
2,sorry I got it!,the volume so low! you cannot hear yourself and the buttons don't work properly. You get what you pay for . . . .
1,TERRIBLE! Don't waste your time or MONEY!!!,"We purchased this microphone for our son for Christmas, and needless to say--its a hunk of junk! I went out to get new batteries for it because I thought it would improve the sound/lights--but NO! It is less than a month old & has hardly been played with because it doesn't work!!!Im calling the 800-number listed on this toy to tell them what a crappy product they have made!"
3,Battery hog,"The biggest problem with this toy is no auto shutoff so it burns up 3 AAA batteries in no time at all. My kids liked to use it at night as a nightlight but it runs(the lights) until it runs out of batteries.Talking in it is barely heard unless you practically shove the mic down your throat which makes it very dirty for several kids to use. My kids slobber on it to hear themselves in it. Its frustrating for me and them because it is almost impossible to keep it supplied with batteries. Needless to say, next time they are not looking, I think I'm going to trash it. There is nothing exciting about a child who says ""microphones batteries are dead"" day after day."
4,Very good value,"I have owned this watch for almost four years and I really like it. It is still in perfect condition and has proved to be very accurate. Apart from changing batteries, no service has been necessary during these years. I believe it is a very competitive option at this price range."
2,Changed battery twice in two years!!,Got it as a Gift!! I like the design.But Its very poor in battery performance..changed batery twice in two years.. :(
5,Tissot T=Classic PR50 2000 Chrograph Watch,"I spend several weeks to buy a watch for dressing events, I ended up with Tissot. It has been five months since I bought it, it works great, only date is needed to be reset at the end of months with 30 days. Thats is not a big deal. Tissot is a brand that you get value of your money from your purchase. This is very good looking and class watch, that worths definitely more than this price. I would definitely suggest it."
2,NO GOOD FOR CANON IP -3000,NO GOOD FOR CANON PIXMA IP-3000 SERIES PRINTERS. BOUGHT THIS AND AFTER TRYING FOR DAYS ALIGNINIG AND RESETTING MY PRINTER THE INK STILL CAME OUT TERRIBLE.
2,bait and switch,when placing the order there were 3 choices the 1 oz and the 4 oz were almost identical in price. i thought i choose the 4oz size and found that i had been sent the 1oz size. when recapping the order confirmation i found that i indeed did place the order for the 1oz size and did not notice the change in size. my loss. and yours.
4,Superior!,"This is a superior product!! My husband has had five knee surgeries. I purchased this product for him 2 weeks prior to his going out Elk hunting. Before he left town he told me the aching in his knees had subsided, but the true test came out in the wilderness climbing mountains. He said he felt great.Highly recommended!!"
