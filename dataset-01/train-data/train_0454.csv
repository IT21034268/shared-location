1,Not a good product,very poor quality it broke within a few uses. I would not recommend this item to anyone. There is a better one it is called the Rivalchopper
2,What can this chop?,"I generally have pretty good luck in picking just the right thing on Amazon, but this was a notable exception. I bought this to chop walnuts and it absolutely doesn't work. I tried chopping carrots for soup- another fail. I even tried onions, since other reviews had mentioned how great it was at making salsa....mediocre at best. The blades are sharp and I like the design of the handle, but it doesn't do the job. I've already tested it out too much to return it, so I imagine it's going to the highest cupboard graveyard of useless kitchen implements. I was very disappointed in this product."
3,Ok,"This type of machine, that is, the hand chopper, is a better invention than sliced bread. This model is a tad flimsy for my jobs, but there are plenty out there that hold up under well under intensive, vegan-based, food preparation stresses."
5,The best Food Chopper available,This food chopper replaced one that was broken when it fell to the floor. I cannot tell you how much I like this item. It is absoluteley amazing and chops everything so well in no time at all. It is also super easy to clean after using. So glad I found it available again.
2,Dioonting,"By the time I get things cut small enough to put in the chopper, I could have practically done it all with a knife!. I will never learn, I guess. Best appliance for cutting or chopping is a great knife."
2,cracked mirror,"Somewhat entertaining, but not worth buying. The original with Richard Burton, Eve Aren, etc. is the only one to buy"
3,Cute peek into a different era of television,"There is a sweet naivete to this production of Alice. The plot frequently is not well thought out (even by Wonderland standards) but the musical numbers are fun. Nanette Fabray is playful and wonderful as the White Queen. Agnus Moorehead as the red Queen (who was brought in to replace Bette Davis after Ms Davis dropped out- she saw Nanette rehearsing the White Queen on roller skates and feared she would be upstaged so suddenly developed a problem with her back) Agnus channels a sort of Bette Davis in her delivery. (A friend who was there in the rehearsal said Bette Davis was pretty marvelous- ""What's one and one and one..... and one"" (Alice-""You go too fast!"") ""She can't add!"" But Agnus was good and much easier to work with. The scenery and costumes are fun- the actors are all having a good time. It is worth a watch. The extras talk a bit about the making of it and worth a peek if that is of interest to you."
1,Don't buy it.,"I recently purchased this item to help with night time launching and loading. They looked fabulous when installed, however; by the time I reached the boat landing one light had blown. By the time I arrived backhome both bulbs were blown and one of my lenses was lost. I ordered parts,and installed them, by the time I arrived at the boat landing both bulbs were blown again. I've spent over $50 on these lights and still can't seewhere I'm backing. Save your money."
3,"Great concept, but...","I read this book a few months back and did like it a lot. However, my issues with the book are the shortness and incomplete nature of some of the authors' stories, not to mention the interjections of Sirona Knight herself during some of them. I found that to be somewhat disconcerting. But, this book at least gives some perspectives on some of today's Pagan authors. The reader gets to see how they all got started, and that is very important within Paganism. Despite my reservations about the execution of the book, it is still a valuable source for someone who is studying Paganism, as Paganism is an experiential religion. The student must know of the experiences of Pagans."
3,Should be titled A Wiccan Like Me,"If this book was titled ""A Wiccan Like Me"" it would have made more sense. Overall it was a good book to promote Wiccan pride and a nice read concerning the lives of Wiccan Witches. And I did get some nice insight into some of the more popular Wiccan authors. But if you are a Witch but not a Wiccan you may be disappointed at the heavy amount of ""Why I became Wiccan"" segments in the different chapters. Yet, each person's story was a wonderful read and no matter what religion you follow, if you are a Witch you can identify with the growth challenges the Wiccan Witches have endured. But for the record, not all Witches are Wiccan."
2,I guess Rosemary Altea is not my cup of tea......,"Perhaps I bought this book thinking it was something else. My understanding is that Rosemary Altea can be labelled a ""psychic medium,"" and I thought this book would include discussions about the ""Other Side"" and how to reach them. I can see how someone who is more involved in spiritual healing could appreciate this book. However, when Altea talks about ""little monsters"" attacking her because she is ""Miss Goodie Goodie""....Rosemary, that's where you lost me!"
2,"Good, not great.","I've reached the final chapter of this book and i have to say that i'm quite underwhelmed. It does make various good points here and there, and perhaps things you will remember for a long time to come. However, there are so many other books that can be bought with 10 times as much profound information and half the price.So i would recomend this if you want to open your mind a little, but not if you're an expert on the spirituality subject."
1,a BIG disappointment,"In summary, the book is a very poor introduction for what it is supposed to be. As pointed out in another review, some facts do not even add up. I loved Rosemary's first and second book, but this one is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Really, a BIG disappointment for me."
1,what a waste of hard earned money,"I purchased this book and one by Wayne Dyer at the same time. Mr Dyers book was worth every penny. In comparison, this one seemed very amateur. I kept reading hoping for something phenomenal to catch my attention but nothing ever did. It was boring from beginning to end and I got absolutely nothing out of it. If you really want to be amazed read some books by Wayne Dyer."
1,Another Clairvoyant Con Artist . . .,"How sad that one is so hungry for money and fame that they would prey on the vulnerable, i.e., suffering, grief-stricken individuals who have tragically lost children, husbands, parents, etc. How do they get away with it? I saw this con artist on Larry King Live. During the show, a young man phoned in and said he lost his grandfather, whom he was very close to, in a hunting accident. Clairvoyant Altea, in her infinite wisdom and God-like powers, said ""I see a wooded area, lots of trees. There are dogs as well."" We're talking about a hunting accident here and she sees woods, trees, and dogs. Imagine that! Further, the caller happened to be from Idaho. And lo and behold! Ms. Altea saw a mountain range. Pathetic. My heart goes out to her victims (the gullible who want desparately to hear a message from their deceased loved ones). How does she sleep at night!"
2,Forgot to add this into my other review!,"From reading the reviews on Rosemary Altea, I had considered buying her other books. I stopped myself from becoming impulsive, and decided to start with ""You Own the Power."" After reading this book, I can surely state that I will NOT buy another one of hers. I am glad I saved my money."
3,who owns the power?,"I'm interested in psychic ability (particularly my own), and found this book to be an interesting read. I would like to comment however, that although Rosemary has been kind enough to share with us her gift, and some tools of the trade, I did find that she waffled on too much about herself. I appreciated her insight, but wanted to know about ME, what can I do? Instead, I found that I was forced to compare myself to her, and subsequently judge myself by Rosemarys standards. On the other hand. It was easy to read. I was sorry for her bitterness (regarding her family, we've all had it hard at some stage - spilling your personal gripes in a book is a bit careless, and hurtful? )"
1,you own the power,"I usually love reading Rosemary Altea's books... But can someone tell me who wrote this! I found the book full of errors and misinformation. The book is not a ""good read"" by any stretch of the imagination. Anyone without any spiritual gift at all could have wriiten this boring tripe! Save your money and ""wait for the movie to come out""!"
5,A must-have for anyone interested in the spirit,"This is the third Altea book I've read, and it differs from the others, because it provides specific, actionable steps to take to tune in to one's own power. The exercises are deceptive-they seem to simple and basic, yet I have discovered that that's the POINT! Do them, do them, do them -- repeat them, repeat them, repeat them. They work. They make a difference. This isn't a book intended simply as a good read -- for that, go back to her two earlier books, the wonderful Eagle and the Rose and the second book, Proud Spirit. I just bought her tape on healing from amazon, and it's excellent -- simply as a relaxation tool if nothing else. So many of these products and authors disapoint, but Rosemary Altea is REAL."
2,Disappointed,"Interesting book, but I tired of her constant references to her childhood. She had a difficult childhood, no doubt, but for a person who is telling her readers to not live in the past, it seems she does a lot of it."
1,who wrote this book?,"usually i pick up one of her books and do not put it down until i have finished it. her latest book, you own the power, i picked up, read a few chapters, put down and have not looked at it since and that was two weeks ago. i find it incredibly boring and i do not think i will finish it."
2,A flawed DVD release by Warner,"The fact that this set contains two double-sided discs makes playback inconvenient for those of us with DVD changers. On my particular set, the sides are mislabeled on disc two, adding to the inconvenience.The program content on both sides of both discs is marred by trailers (narrated in bombastic style by ABC's voice of the 70s and early 80s) which fill up the first HALF of chapter one. That's right; the only way to bypass these spoilers is to skip to chapter two then rewind half a chapter.UPDATE: On June 28, 2011 Warner re-released this title on three single-sided discs. The program content is the same; however, the bit rate for Episode 1 is reduced in the 2011 release."
4,lovestory,"I couldhave feel the joy &the heart ache of their love. One that last a lifetime thru all that, would be wonderful."
5,Wonderful,I loved this mini-series! I cannot say enough about how heart moving and dramatic this show was. You really can feel for Meggie and Ralph as love so much but cannot be together. They just don't make shows like this anymore! I recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story. Part 2: The Missing Years is pretty good as well. Overall one of my favorite films ever.
2,"An American in Adelaide, South Australia","Agree with you, Victoria, Australia: This was a totally Americanized version of McCullough's book, filmed, I understand, in Oregon, of all places. The American accents grated on the senses. How dumb are we supposed to be to believe all the cast was Australian? How about a remake with an all-Australian cast?"
1,"Don't, unless you're an incurable romance film addict","Plot: Predictable throughout.Symbolism: Heavy-handed.Scenery: Decent (all those nice clean film sheep!) but not worth watching the film for.Characters: Most one-dimensional, and all lacking common sense.Acting: Mostly wooden; occasionally absurd. Meggie's constant sexy twitching (she acts like she's working under a lamppost 24/7)! Her son's leaden sincerity!Costumes and hairstyles: Styles of the 1980s serve seamlessly for the 1920s through the 1960s.Premise: Silly.Summary: Give this film a miss!"
1,Very disappointing!,"""Very disappointing! Why on earth would they make a dvd with only half the book??? I ordered this only to discover that we were missing - the rest of the story! Please revise this ad by advising customers that it is NOT the complete set!"""
5,fast!!!!!,"awesome delivery time. This is why i love Amazon i recommend everyone to show here!!!! If i need dvd, movies i havent seen in a while i will look here!!"
3,Pretty good mini series,"I like the mini series, but Father Ralph always got on my nerves; in the book and the movie. My favorites were Fee and, of course, Justine. I liked Meggie best after her son died. She really slammed Ralph with her coldness. My favorite part of the whole show. Just to let Amazon know, because in their review of this movie they made a slight mistake, Barbara Stanwyck played Mary Carson ---Meggie's Aunt(Not her Grandmother)---."
5,mdavis,"One of the best most-talked about mini-series of it's time. What can I say? Richard Chamberlin is the ""king of mini-series"" !"
4,As expected,"The DVD was just as expected. It was way too pricey for a DVD, but it came as no suprise. Shipping was way too much to."
1,Disappointed,"I bought The Thorn Birds as I loved it years ago. I watched the first dvd and thoroughly enjoyed it. I came to play the 2nd one and am I missing something? There seems to be a huge chunk missing - Ralph training for a cardinal, Meggie meeting the sheep farmer, the fire. It opened up with Ralph becoming ordained and Meggie getting married! Where's the missing chunk??MiserableSue"
3,the torn birds,"I did not received the complete film. I tried to reach amazon customer service and was unable to reach anyone. I would still like to receive the full length film, please advise to whom I need to speak."
3,"It has Problems, but is Loveable.","The Best Mini-series of all time, in my opinion. I only wish I could have done the editing. Some of the story is utterly ridiculous, and sometimes vulgar. Sometimes pure genious, and truly touching. Daring for 1983, it truly pushed the envelope for television at that time, but does have some amount of dignity. I applaud the performances of Stanwyck, Kiley, Simmons, Ward, and Chamberlain, in that order. The author was obviously mildly insane, it is certainly 1 of top 10 TV-Movie favorites, in any case."
5,Meggie really should've read the book 'He's Just Not That Into You',"I am really late to the party -- although this miniseries was aired in 1983, I finish watching it just now. I love the story, however I can't help thinking that both Ralph and Meggie are very clueless. *spoiler* Ralph, make up your mind. Which one do you want? The Church or the woman? If you do want to serve God, don't keep coming back to the woman and make her heartbroken and confused.The same goes to Meggie. Had she known of the book 'He's Just Not That Into You', she would've left Ralph long ago.But without the drama, it wouldn't be a good story, would it?"
5,The Thorn Birds,"Excellent! Unforgetable! It is worth seeing a few times over.Magnificent cast, acting, scenery."
3,The Thorn Birds,I actually did not get a chance to watch this DVD yet but I remember being a fan of the book.
5,One of the TRULY great love stories of all time...,"I recently watched this movie for the first time, I was a bit too young to watch it's original broadcast in 1983 and too understand it at that time. This is a MUST HAVE to any movie collection.The tragedy of watching Father Ralph DeBricassart fall in love with Meggie, but knowing that he can not be the man to her that he wants to be, and that she wants him to be because of his devotion to God. Watching Meggie grow, and the pain that their ""Forbidden"" love causes them both.Follow the lives of Meggie and Father Ralph through their lives, their love, their losses...A truly AMAZING story of love and loss."
4,Classic,"A wonderful tale with its own tragic variation of the age old struggle we all face. Do we do the right thing or follow our heart? This movie focus's on the life of one man fighting the internal battle between loving God verses being human. Does he go on living a life worthy of his priestly robes or does he give in to his manly desires. The web of intrigue deepens as he continually faced with the one thing that threatens his vows most, Meg. This mini series is full of action, romance, struggle and beautiful scenery. It's definitely one to watch again and again."
4,Good,What I expected it to be and happy with all of it. If I need anything else from here I have no problem buying here again.
5,Thorn Birds,Absolutely Wonderful. just as I remembered. my entire family enjoyed as well and they weren't even born when this movie first aired.
5,amzing heart wrenching story,"I think kthis is the saddest and greatest love story ever shown on television. no matter how many times i watch i pray that meggie and ralph end happily ever after. it has passion,betrayal, deceipt, love, hate , and everything else between in this cast of characters"
5,Thorn Birds is the best made for tv movie,"I had ordered the Thorn Birds because it was such a great movie, I got it sooner than expected and it was just as described. It was so good to see it again I will be ordering more from you I am very pleased."
4,The Thorn Birds,"Excellent saga, excellent story line. The Producer and Director guide the actors into a really believable Australian story. This movie is a credit to Colleen McCullough and will probably be listed among the Classic movies of our time."
4,Universal romantic saga,"Intriguing romance, well acted by Ward, Brown and Chamberlain. Beautiful cinematography and music."
5,Great Gift,This was purchased as a gift for my mother who absolutely loves this movie. My only concern was it took a full week to ship from a 1.5 hour car ride away!
4,Thornbirds Found!,"After much searching for this title, I finally found it and am very pleased with the product and the delivery!"
5,A Mini-series I liked!,I've never liked a mini-series before. The Thorn Birds is the only exception. I fell in love with Father Ralph too and my heart broke for Meggie. A true masterpiece I will NEVER forget!
2,What happened to The Thorn Birds,"I loved the book and the mini-series of The Thorn Birds, when I found it here on DVD I ordered 2 copies. What a disappointment, so much edited out and for no reason. DVD's were made for the miniseries! Don't waste your time, I haven't even watched the entire movie."
5,I LOVED this!,This was my ALL TIME FAVORITE TV mini-series!!!! I have watched this over and over again and never tire of it!! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an excellent love story!
5,The best love story ever!!,"This has to be the most beautiful story i have ever seen not to mention the saddest one as well. I think a lot of people can relate to it when they find a love, which they know they cant have. I have to recommend this to all, that love a good love story because this is truly one of a kind and it is told so beautifully and its so in-depth with the characters. Richard Chambrelain and Rachel Ward are two wonderful performers in this, they portray their characters with such passion."
4,Love this movie but DVD was scratched,"This movie is a classic, love it still after all these years. I found it here on Amazon and was thrilled.Only reason I marked it 4 stars is because the DVD case was damaged and the first disc was scratched."
4,The Thorn Birds,Very good and I would definitely recommend it:) This is entertaining viewing and it a good story and a lotbetter than some of the viewing you get on television
5,Chamberlain and Ward strike your emotions!,"Richard Chamberlain and Rachael Ward ignite your innermost sparks in the movie The Thorn Birds. It is a timeless classic that strikes the fancy of old and young viewers alike. The personal struggles that these characters endure on screen as they go through life are so dramatic and intense, they will have you on the edge of your seat and talking to your TV! The conflict between morality and love is INCREDIBLE! And the passion that ALL of the actors have is evident in this movie. This is a must see film, for people of all ages. The beauty of The Thorn Birds will continue to captivate audiences for many generations to come!"
4,great,"I first saw this series when I was a child and found it to be wonderful. It still stands as a terrific miniseries, even if it is melodramatic. Ward is radiant, Chamberlain is excellent, Stanwyck and Simmons are remarkable. Incredibly tragic and romantic."
5,"A thrilling, ever lasting, novel",A novel which keeps the reader flipping the pages without noticing the time
3,"A good book that came out right before the XFL started. It has some errors in it, but...","Good pics, good players without alot of egos, too. Good compendiumto get the XFL fan ready for whatturned out to be the one and onlyseason of the Xtreme Football League.At least it wasn't NFL Europe!"
5,Contents:,"Articles and essays from different people like philosophers, biologists, activists and lobbyists. Here you learn first hand accounts of the stories that have made headlines around the world...the plight of the Silver Spring laboratory monkeys, the freeing of the Island of the Dragon dolphins, the successful campaigns against the Draize and LD50 tests, extinctions of species, and confinement of animals in farm factories and zoos."
4,In the future,I think Peter Singer is right in the battle to protect the animals. He shows in the book why is necessary the men change his mind .
3,"Great content, but.....","Great content, but overpriced: I already have most of this stuff in the ""bonus features"" on other discs.DROP THE PRICE!"
3,Cute,"Not as great as I thought it would be. Loved the Toy Story Short, wasn't thrilled about some of the others though."
1,"Great shorts, but...","I give the videos 5 stars, but...They made the disc so that each short has to be selected and started from the menu. In other words, there is no ""play all"" selection. My kids want this video on all the time, but I can't always be there every 5 minutes (literally) to select/start each short. Even when I am sitting and watching with them, I don't like to have to keep selecting each individual viewing.Epic Fail for whoever came up with this menu idea.The first PIXAR shorts disc isn't like this. Come on PIXAR! The shorts are the best thing from PIXAR as of late. Now this? I think quality control is slipping."
2,Pixar Shorts #2,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this Pixar Shorts addition. First there were repeats from the First collection, 2nd none of the shorts were as high quality in content as I'm used to with Pixar."
2,Dissapointing.,I was looking forward to this having enjoyed volume 1. But so much of this appears to be student works by John Lassiter and other. Other things were inspired by Pixas films but not as shorts included before theater released movies.
2,Pixar Short Films Collection 2,Thought for the price I'd get to see some shorts I've never seen. Not very good. The 1st one was much better.
3,"Excellent content, but no ""play all"" feature??","Pixar once again showcases their short films with this fantastic compilation, but I have a major complaint. As the parent of a three-year old I'd love to be able to select ""play all"" and have my daughter watch all 12 shorts at once, but there isn't one. You have to go to the menu and select a film every single time. Twelve times, once every few minutes."
5,What is not to love about Pixar shorts?,"True, most of these can be found as included shorts on longer Disney movies, but there are times when it is a lot of fun to watch them collectively. The First Collection has been a big hit in our house so we have been eagerly awaiting this one. Great fun."
2,Issues,"Biggest issues for this follow-up to Pixar Volume 1 was the fact you could not play all with a single press of play.Second issue limited original videos of their single works, seems as though Disney decided to throw together all their shorts from each feature movie and cobble it up for more profit in their pockets.Sad......."
2,Not up to Pixar's Brillant standards,"Viewing this was a lesson in patience! The flow was terrible. Each segment had to be viewed individually. Could not press ""play"" and sit back to enjoy. Was an expensive buy and totally not worth the cost!"
3,"Great, but the bonus features are not G rated","Be careful and don't let your children watch the bonus features. I did and found out it was not G rated as the movie says it is. There were swear words in one of the ""student films"". Of course these ""student films"" are from Pixar executives when they were students, so I thought they would be fun to watch. I think they need to remove the one film. My 5 year old daughter did not catch that the clown said the ""f"" word, but my 9 year old niece did. They also say pi*@ed. Not good Disney! It needs to be removed from the DVD!"
5,dont miss out on this gem,"totally makes up for the first collection. Its amazing, funny, consuming from start to finish. Great for kids, and dont be surprised if you watch it for yourself. Instant Classic"
2,Missing Toy Story short,"For people who already own all Pixar Blu-rays, this contains very little new material, namely:- Up short: George & A. J.- Toy Story short: Small Fry- Cars shorts: Air Mater, Time Travel Mater- 7 student films""Small Fry"" is an absolute hoot, just perfect - while the others are so-so.Still, such a release would be a nice thing for Pixar completists like me. Emphasis on ""would"".You see, this collection is not complete at all, because it omits the third Toy Story short, ""Partysaurus Rex"", which was shown in theatres along with the 3D version of ""Finding Nemo"" this summer. Why this short isn't included is just baffling. To top it off, ""Partysaurus Rex"" won't even be on the upcoming ""Finding Nemo"" Blu-ray.So, two stars. One for this set being incomplete, and another for the brilliance which is ""Small Fry""."
1,Pixar Quality Compromised.,I own Pixar Shorts Vol. 1 and value it as an exceptional collection of very unique and special short films. When I saw that Vol. 2 was available I didn't hesitate to order based on the exceptional quality of Vol. 1. That is not the case. It was a terrible disappointment. I'll only keep it to have my library collection complete. Don't try for Vol. 3 unless you can return to the greatness of Vol. 1.
3,Pixar 2,It is not better than the first Pixar short story. Do not waste the money on this Pixar short story movie.
3,Who designed this Disc?!,"The material on this disc is excellent. Typical Pixar material that doesn't skimp on quality. A lot of the shorts had my four year-old daughter in absolute stitches, and at the very least we enjoyed watching all of the disc together as a family.That being said there is no ""play all"" feature. So if my kid wants to watch this, I have to help her get to the next feature every 2-3 minutes. We borrowed this from the library, and have no plans to ever purchase it because of this huge distraction."
4,"6 x 5 stars + 3 x 3 stars! Yet, too short, and not attractive enough for repeated viewing that qualifies for a Blu-ray purchase","Indeed my overall comment had been summarized in the title. Basically I love them all except the one dervied from Ratatouille and the two from Cars. The others are artistic, creative, beautiful, funny or even hilarious. Nevertheless, they are just too short. Also, even they had been quite impactful when my family and I first watched them, we got no interest to do repeated viewing, a rare situation we had with other Pixar movies. Well, that might manifest the importance of an outstanding storyline in the success of most Pixar films. Definitely a good one for rent, but not with enough value for a Blu-ray purchase."
3,Mediocre,There are some boring ones and a couple are good. This was just okay...not very excited and was a little disappointed. The cloud short film is the best and I would love to see more of that one in the future.
5,Excellent.,"Me and my daughter love this. It's cute, fun and a great time. My only issue is that given that it's a series of shorts it really needs a chapter and chapter skip feature. Although pointless now since I've bought all the individual shorts."
3,Packaging,"The episodes themselves are typically quite good as I love the entire series. However, when the set came, the disks were packaged in slim cases w/two disks per case. During shipping the case sides come in contact w/the disks and create areas on each disk that are not playable. Make sure when you order these that they come in full width cases or you could well be disappointed playing these on your DVD player."
4,The best season yet!,"Yet another season of ""Murder She Wrote"", and the best yet, in my opinion. Although mystery writer and amateur detective Jessica Fletcher is still traipsing around America and the world in general, this season features more episodes set in Cabot Cove than in any of the three previous seasons, and is the better for it (these are the best episodes, as far as I am concerned). The plots are still as flimsy and predictable as ever, but if you've made it to season four of this series, you probably don't care. This season's guest stars include John Glover, Clu Gulager, Janet Leigh, Rene Auberjonois, Billy Zane, John Saxon and Dean Stockwell."
5,Murder She Wrote Season 4,"My Mother LOVES all of the murder she wrote seasons. It was her favorite show. Now that it is gone, I am going to make sure she has all 8 of them."
5,Outstanding,"Season 4 of Murder She Wrote is outstanding...I've been watching this series with my grandmother since I was a young girl and as an adult, I enjoy it even more...Angela Landsbury is fantastic at solving murder mysteries and entertaining while she does it...I highly recommend this TV series for anyone interested in 'good' TV."
1,Murder She Wrote Season 4,"This dvd series had a few disc problems. They did the rolling distorted look as if tracking needed adjusting (as in the days of VHS).However, they were returned and a credit was promptly added to my account. I thought it would take longer but didn't. Also, was reimbursed the return shipping charge. Will order again."
5,Jessica's Done It Again,"If you love Murder She Wrote, you will love this season. However, some of the episodes are a little thin but, it is still good."
2,"I Love it, but I hate it","what a pity!, They did it again, the fourth season alike third season don't have subtitles in other languages, why? if in first and second season have it"
1,Murder She Wrote DVD collection,"I was very displeased with this vendor. I received the set along with year three. The set for the third year worked perfectly. This one, year four, skipped, paused, stopped, and none of the DVD's works properly. I returned it, per given instructions, and received only half of what it cost me. Why should I pay for something I didn't get? Plus, it cost me $8 to return it. I won't purchase anything from this vendor again...I was very unhappy. I don't feel I can trust his merchandise to be of good quality. It cost me $20 for my trouble."
5,Have we finally reached the plateau of single-sidedness?,"I absolutely love this show, and am thrilled to own the first 3 seasons that have been released. However, I must agree with many fans of the show out there that have had problems with the double-sided discs, which Universal has, for some reason, felt they needed to use up to this point. In particular, my season 2 set sometimes won't play certain episodes, and other times it will!?? I see that season 4 indicates is a 5-disc set -- which leaves me wondering -- are we finally to be given the privilege of single-sided discs??? I TRULY hope so -- as do many other fans. Thank you, Universal. I am also pleased that they are releasing these season sets at a fairly decent pace. I'm excited to get this next season set!!!"
5,Maybe it's just nostalgia...,"but I do love this series. The fourth season is one of the best anyway. I'm a great fan of Angela Lansbury. It's finest art, how she acts as e.g. Jessica's slightly vulgar London cousin Emma. My absolute favourite in this season is ""If it's Thursday, it must be Beverly"". I cannot say how many times I've watched it and still cannot stop laughing about it.It's highly enjoyable, I'll get never fed up with it!"
2,DVD Quality issues,"Before purchasing this set I read through the reviews of previous seasons. I read several that mentioned the poor quality of the dvds for season 2 and 3 and recommended skipping to the 4th season. I did as suggested and am here to report that season 4 has major glitches with quality as well. We have tried to watch 2 of the dvds and have ended up very frustrated when they begin stopping, pausing and skipping around. One episode was totally unwatchable once it began to pause etc...I haven't returned it nor will I purchase any more simply because I don't trust what I will be getting and it sounds like when people return their faulty sets they are merely replaced with another faulty disk set...It also sounds like Universal does not care about the feedback they are getting from customers...."
5,ANGELA LANSBURY IS WONDERFUL & SHOW IS FUN,"I ALWAYS TELL MY FRIENDS THAT IF CABOT COVE AND JESSICA FLETCHER WERE REAL, I WOULD NEVER GO TO CABOT COVE OR BE WHERE JESSICA WAS BECAUSE I WOULD PROBABLY BE UNDER INDICTMENT FOR MURDER (DO TO THE FACT THAT I AM THE ONLY POSSIBLE SUSPECT SINCE EVERY ONE ELSE HAS BEEN ACCUSED BEFORE). BUT I LOVE THE SERIES. IT IS FUN, INTERESTING, WELL WRITTEN AND HAS GREAT PLOTS. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RERUNS MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE TO WATCH THEM WHEN THEY COME IN RERUNS ALL THE TIME. ANGELA LANDSBURY IS WONDERFUL ACTRESS AND DOESN'T ACT LIKE A PRIMA DONNA. AT ALL THE AWARDS SHOW SHE IS WONDERFUL AS HERSELF. SHE IS A PERSON WHO DOESN'T TAKE HERSELF TOO SERIOUSLY AND ENJOYS LIFE. ALSO THE SCRIPTS A VERY GOOD AND THE PRODUCTION VALUES AS WELL."
5,You will play piano fast if you listen and train with Scott,"Wonderful book\CD. Scott has a pbs tv show teaching people to play piano.His system works so if you want to play piano or keyboard, listen andlearn from Scott and you will be playing. SCott is great and so are hisbooks and I play a million times better after Scott then I did before."
5,What a great find,"Not too many newsstands carry this magazine, so it is well worth having a subscription. Most of today's magazines are published by large conglomerates (such as AOL-Time-Warner), just the type of organizations that would NEVER say a bad word against a government that supports them in every way.THIS is a magazine for the people...not afraid to tell it like it is...to uncover dirty politics (be it Republican or Democrat) or corrupt business. If more people would read this magazine, more people would be outraged at what's going on, and perhaps things would start heading in the right direction.But this magazine isn't just politics. They have great articles on music, books, etc., as well.This is no Time or Newsweek, kissing up to the politicians and big business that have this nation in such an awful mess. This is reality. Subscribe today."
1,Warmed Over Socialism....,"The ageing 60's left sounds a little strident...and pathetic. While the best-seller lists are dominated by conservative mainstream publications - such as ""Bias"", revealing what we always knew - the worn-out left is still [pandering] to Marxism, enviro-nazism, and any form of anti-heterosexualism that the current fad embraces. If you like to laugh at the same old ""blame {big-business, Christian, free-market, heterosexual, working-for-a-living, intelligent choice, monogamous, wise-use} individuals who are responsible for all of us loser's problems"" - type articles, this is the magazine for you! I'll stick with the land of opportunity, hard work, and wise choices to get me through!"
2,Not worth it!,"Mother Jones is an odd magazine: the topics covered in the magazine are mostly interesting. The articles however are extremely long and contain next to no information. Don't get me wrong, I am all for long articles... if they contain well summarized, well researched information. This is not the case for most articles in Mother Jones. It seems that the authors are trying to hide as little information as possible in a 10 page long prose story about sympathetic characters. In some cases, a bit more semi-humorous information is hidden amongst some drawings.All in all, this seems like kids news for hip grown-ups: the author knows that the reader doesn't really care about complicated stuff such as politics or economics, but still wants to pretend to be a well-informed intellectual, so he wraps about a bit of information in a nice story. Some people might like that kind of journalism, I prefer real news!And be warned: if you subscribe to Mother Jones, you will be flooded with junk mail."
3,exposing amazon's evil -- nice job.,"So I'm listening to the NPR story on Amazon's practices, and I thank Mother Jones and this reporter for bringing this news. I'm now taking my business elsewhere -- to local independent merchants wherever possible. What an awful company I've been buying products from."
5,The Best,"I can't emphasize enough how much i love this magazine! It's thought-provoking, socially-responsible and thoroughly-researched. It's THE magazine to have and I fully endorse it."
2,Stupid waste of time and money and her talent,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm a fan of old B&W movies and a fan of Marlene Detriech. This was just stupid. I don't understand why in most of her movies they just have her change from one gorgeous costume to another while trying to wade through banal pap for a script. The best movie, in my opinion, that she ever made was Golden Earrings. She actually acted and she did it wearing one ragged dress through the whole thing."
1,Glycergrow Review,"I wouldn't really recommend this product. It will not mix with liquids, and is challenging to consume. I did not notice any beneficial effects while taking this product for two weeks. As far as I can tell, it does not work as claimed."
2,What a waste of an album....,"I can't believe after the history of great music by this band, they would choose to do an album of covers.... Frankly, this cd ...!!! The last track is a great rocking song, but they should have thrown the rest in the garbage... I love the bottle rockets, and i am hugely disappointed in this... They should have included the one good song on an album with their own material, and canned the rest of this ... I had not known of doug sahm before, and after hearing this, i would never listen to him if i had the chance.... I hope they make a new album soon with their own songs, because i was looking forward to some new tunes, but this is a waste of time!!!!!!!!"
2,rockets new disc kind of fizzles,"For those of you who have enjoyed the bottle rockets over the years, this is a disapointment,a new disc of cover songs is not what I expected after the last few years of nothing new from them. Brian's lyrical whit and great song writing style is nowhere to be found on their latest release, just the songs of Doug Sahm."
1,RUN Away from this one!,"Man does this disk SUCK! If you like ANY of their previous disks, it's NOTHING like them. Where the creativity went, the hooks, and great drum guitar work went, I have no idea. 24 Hours a day remains their high water mark, this is SO much less than that. It's going in the trash, and I'm not joking at all."
5,Great family fun!,This is such a fun game. We have enjoyed the adult version and my daughter enjoyed playing her friend's junior version. I have been trying to find it at the stores for awhile now with no luck. I was so excited to find it on Amazon! It came quick and in good condition!
1,Not fun,This item has been discontinued but I managed to find a used one and it is not fun nor interesting. That's why it was discontinued.
5,Snower Ground,"As usual, Warren Miller has put out a great snow show. ALl of his movies have great video and music to back up the snow show. I did notice he did not have much to say in this movie, he left it up to his son to do much of the talking. We hope he is in good health."
2,Lots of blabla any little action,This documentary takes you frequently behind the scenes rather than to the action itself. The director shows he is very keen on the Alaskan landscapes with some respect to other remarkable ski resorts.I was expecting a more extravaganza-ski-type movie rather than a documentary-type film.
3,Higher Ground,"There's a lot less skiing/boarding, and more movie-like attempted story telling. Also a lot less Warren Miller which is not a good thing. Warren is the master of these DVD's."
1,Worst ski movie ever made,Save yourself a complete waste of time and skip this movie anywhere you see it playing. it is the worst ski movie ever made. there's a formula to a successful ski flick and this one completely missed the mark.
1,"do not buy, not worth it","not wortth it, very little snowboarding and terrible music. added stupid sutff like sky diving in the video. yeah it has some cool mountain shots but its really corny and commericalized. not worth buying, not missing anything wonderful"
2,Not pleased with the art work,"The art work looks very scratchy and I at first sight I regretted my purchase. The velvet box looks cheap & poorly constructed. Most importantly as long as the urn holds my precious cargo safely, I will be happy. However, if I wasn't in a time crunch I would have exchanged it for one of the others I purchased."
2,Too limited in scope,"I purchased this book to provide another perspective from Larry Fine's book. If you are shopping for upright pianos primarily for a beginner, then this book may be ok, but the section on grands was limited to US and some Asian companies. None of the high-end German pianos were rated. The tables in the back, comparing various statistics was helpful. This book would be greatly improved if more pianos were incorporated. Larry Fine's book is far more comprehensive."
2,This book is much less useful than Larry Fine's Piano Book,"This book does not contain any information additional to the information in Larry Fine's book. It feels like a super-condensed version of ""The Piano Book"" but, unfortunately, much of quite useful and entertaining information from the latter is absent. Save your money."
3,Hmmmm -,"I feel the same way about this book as I do about the Tatting Hearts book - i wasn't oohing and aahing about the designs, and it was more like a lesson in split rings, and the designs were an excuse to use them. I didn't like ONE butterfly design in this book, and a lot of them didn't look like butterflies.I was really surprised because I had heard great things about these books, and i was hoping to find some cute hearts and butterflies to tat. Try to look at a copy first before you buy!"
4,Older is better,"Bring back the smoothe, plastic coated cards I played with 20 years ago. The newer ones are textured and very difficult to play with. Very enjoyable game to play--children and adults alike. It seems some company could manufacture cards the way they used to be made."
2,Great game; poor quality cards.,"Our family loves Rook. We couldn't find new Rook cards in the store so we ordered online. The quality of the cards is poor and they even seem ""smaller"" than our old deck. Disappointed."
2,Also known as Euchre...,"My wife and I picked this up at the store and were severely disappointed. Just a remake of an already established game. Save yourself some time and money and go look up the rules for Euchre, get a deck of regular playing cards from the junk drawer or dollar store and enjoy the same game for almost nothing."
4,Rook,Rook is a good game for your brain. We play twice a week at the Senior Center so they don't last too long.
2,I found a top quality alternative deck of cards,"The Rook cards I kept buying were almost a waste money! They have gotten so bad that after a few rounds we were all getting annoyed. I contacted Hasbro several times and even sent them some of their lousy cards back to their office. No change and it's three years later. I just found a new company online that makes essentially identical cards except they are made of good material. Yup, they are really good. I have several decks of them now. NumberedGameCards.c"
5,Very Fun,I will recommend this type rook for my friends to buy. Very easy to read the numbers and tell the colors apart.
5,For my 83 year old mother,"I bought this deck for my elderly mother who plays solitaire several times a day. Her ancient ROOK deck was getting worn out, and she didn't know where to get another. She was happy when I found it for her. I think the nostalgia of this deck is what she likes about it, plus her elderly eyes can read the numbers easily."
3,Rook,"My family has been Rook nuts since the early '60's, but, I ordered two (2) decks, and still have only received one (1 ) deck I have talked with the company, yet, only one has arrived. Also, I ordered and paid for two (2) decks, in boxes, and the one they sent was in a flimsly cardboard container that hung from a hook. Disappointed in the product and disappointed in the service. I will keep at it until they send the other deck that has already been paid for."
5,Another brilliant CD from Christopher Lawrence,"Like many others, I am burned out on boring, predictable and shallow trance. Thank heavens that there are still DJs like Christopher Lawrence out there who keep it fresh, interesting and on the edge. From start to finish, this is a first class CD. Yet again, Christopher Lawrence proves that he is an easy equal to the Sasha's and Oakenfolds of this world."
5,The Best One Yet!!,"Oh my gosh, this cd is the best one yet. Trilogy and United States of Trance were good but this was great. I would consider this as good as his Rise and Temptation cds. He was my first DJ that got me into the ""scene"" and the first that introduce me to the world of Trance, House, and other genres."
4,truly hypnotic; flawless transition from start to finish,"This album has the kind of dreamy, spaced-out repetition that reminds me of Disc 1 of Dave Ralph's 2-disc ""Resident Alien"" album, without all the vocals. Like Resident Alien disc 1, this album takes a more minimalist approach to trance (as if an adjective like minimalist could even be applied to the trance genre in the first place). While not as upbeat as a lot of popular albums today, this is the kind of album that really lets the DJ do his thing. Call it repetitive all you like, and complain about the massive length of the songs all you want, you must admit Christopher Lawrence is a MASTER at mixing. Each track is seamlessly blended together into one flawless and gradual mix from start to finish. Truly superb... an album that takes you on a seemingly endless journey."
4,"Romulad et juliette (Mama, there's a man in your bed)","I first saw this film while stationed in London some 8-10 years ago. I have not seen it since that time yet still consider it one of the funniest and touching films I have ever seen. How two people from different backgrounds can come together and appreciate each other is a lesson we all should learn. Recommend it to a friend. By the way, If you like this movie, you may enjoy Crossing Delancey with Amy Irving and Inside Moves with John Savage, Diana Scarwig and David Morse."
5,Romuald et juliette,"This beautifullly funny film was originally titled Romuald et Juliette which gave a much better impression of the twists and turns in store for the lucky watcher than Mama, there's a man in your bed. Daniel Auteuil gives a fantastic performance as the self absorbed company president too important to see what's going on around him, and in the comedy of errors that follows he sees, perhaps for the first time, love beauty and happiness. My favourite all time romance film, I smile the whole way through."
4,Great movie but one little thing...,"I stumbled on this movie and really like it. I think it's clever, sends a message. Basically I agree with everything everyone here says but one thing I did notice...if he is so in love with her (after all this really is a love story) why don't they show you the couple kissing? The scene where they made love was 'off'. It didn't seem like they were in love; no tender touchings or expressions. The one thing that bothered me about this movie; as if is was ok to go THIS far but not far enough to show physical tenderness. One other commenter noticed the same thing. Otherwise, good movie."
1,Garbage,"Looking for the unedited version of China 9? Look elsewhere. Along with being edited, the quality is equivalent to a 3rd generation VHS copy. Zero stars."
4,Par but not his best,"RLS is a fabulous writer. These stories are not necessarily his best but they give a flavor of his obsessions with the dark side of the puritanical Victorian soul. He catalogues the trials of men in demanding circumstances, often self-imposed, with a 19th century sensibility that oozes subversion. He winks at us with glittering language."
4,Gem in the genre,"In three short stories that combine to form a novella, the prince of Bohemia battles the master of the suicide club, an evil soul who profits by the deathwish of others. Delightfully full of the clichés of the era and gently thrilling."
5,Surprisingly excellent renditions.,"I was surprised by how excellent some of the renditions of these songs were. I listen to a lot of music but I was not familiar with Eydie's style and sound until I bought this disc, and now this is one of my top favorites. Her renditions of these classics are the BEST of the many that are out there: ""Since I Fell For You"", ""What'll I Do"", ""God Bless The Child"", and ""Round Midnight"". Definitely worth having."
3,Gotta give it points for trying,"Three movies: Life pod is inspired by theHitchcock ""Lifeboat"" and is a good, sound, little made for tv flick. It suffers from a ittle overindulgent acting but is none the less entertaining and suspenseful. Raging sharks: this tries sooo hard to be a good movie but falls just short making silly errors such as repeating stock footage shots of shark attacks etc. It's still worth a little indulgence if you don't mind an honest attempt style of film making. Skeleton man: should be avoided by any thinking human wishing to preserve their sanity. The only saving grace of this ""Rosmary's baby "" of movies is that it eventually ends. Pray that it dosn't lobotmize you in the proccess. Save yourself and use it as a drinks coaster instead!"
2,May be useful to some,"I had hoped this book would have advice on applying for VA benefits, but its mostly a description of benefits and eligibility. Fifty of the 250 pages is simply a listing of VA facilities, which you can easily look up online, in your local phone book, or by calling the national benefits number.The information is the same thing I got from the VA, and since the book covers many programs, it doesn't go into depth about any program or how to avoid problems applying for benefits. It's likely that only a small portion of the book applies to you unless you have a 100% service connected disability. If that isn't you, I recommend browsing the book at a bookstore before you decide to buy.Most of the information in this book is available online at the VA website."
4,GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR VETS,The book was good but actually I had picked up a copy of the same infofrom the local VA hospital for no cost.
1,vetrans guide to benefits,this book must be written by somebody that works for the VA. it is obvious that mr.Budahan has never had to put up with the rudeness and garbage you get at the va. And to call VA medical facilities the latest and greatest in medical care is down right laughable. this book is a total waste of money. better information can be obtained from the VA itself.
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!,"We puchased these for our (3) guinea pigs and they are awful. The leashes do not fit on the animal - we tried in vain for 45 minutes to get these to work and the guinea pig simply puts its front paws through the front of the velcro and slips right out. We woud have returned these products (the three we purchased), but the kids were SO excited (thinking they would work) that they tore the packaging. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! These should not even be sold."
2,NOT FOR GUINEA PIGS!,"My guinea pig is less than one year old, and this harness was still too small for him. The neck is too tight, and even once I expanded it with Velcro, the waist was too tight anyway. He looks ridiculous in it and doesn't like it one bit. I'm sure it works fine for ferrets, but don't buy it for a guinea pig. Both you and your cavy will be disappointed."
3,Not satisfied.,"I'm not satisfied with the MEDIUM sized vest. It's barely bigger than the small and the large is way too big. If it would of been sized exactly between the small and the large,I'm pretty sure it would of fit.If I send it back do I have to pay for it. And would I get a full refund including the shipping?ITEM bought from Amazon online: Ware Nylon Walk-N-Vest Small Pet Harness and Leash, MEDIUMLINK:www.amazon.com/Ware-Nylon-Walk-N-Vest-Harness-Medium/dp/B000HG96FM/ref=sr_1_16?s=pet-supplies&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1324453996&sr;=1-16"
1,This series has developed a cult following...,"...and that should scare any Christian who sees it. Bruce Wilkinson is self-serving, and motivated by dollar signs, and in essence has created a cult. His books (and the candles, journals, coasters, ballcaps, and posters) try to brainwash people into believing that God is some kind of genie. The book itself is condescending, and teaches children that God is just something else to manipulate, instead of being the awesome, mighty leader that He is. Instead of reading this book to your children, try the Bible. It will set them on a much straighter path, and will have much better results."
2,2 words: Industrial music,"Let me qualify: Not 100% of my music collection is stuff I'm happy with. However, I make comedy video shorts, and this music is perfect for corporate/industrial video stuff (which I parody with this music). As a T.D. work, it's the pits. This sounds like they either needed some quick cash, or did it for a friend on spec. For good T.D: Underwater Sunlight, Rubycon, Risky Business Soundtrack, and the LEGEND Soundtrack."
4,The Separation of a City,"This was a very unique 1989 project for Edgar Froese, as the soundtrack is for a 360-degree movie that was shown at the premier of the Imagine 360 theater in West Berlin.With Paul Haslinger, Froese delivers a much more metallic edge to the soundscape, though it is a vision from the sadness/bitterness of separation. Alexander Square is the foundation piece to the work, while a trio of tracks - Hitchhiker's Point, Brandenburg Gate, Wall-Street - flow into each other with majestic colors.The music obviously comes from the heart and Froese takes a journey past the man-made wall and barbed-wire to musically gaze into the soul of the people."
1,weak as water,"Possibly their worst album ever (with the exception of Heartbreakers - 0 stars). Little more than elevator music: thin, redundant and utterly flavorless. A ""contractual obligation"" album if there ever was one; turn the synths on auto, dinkity-dinkety-dinkety-casiodrumset-dinkity-doink for a mere 38 minutes, while the musicians go out for a latte or diet soda or something equally bland to wash down the prozac. Sounds like a soundtrack for one of those real estate programs on tv. There are plenty of superior TD's to choose from instead, such as Phaedra, Stratosfear, Force Majeure, Tangram, Logos, Poland - anything but this!"
2,This isn't the one to get.,"While all the performances on this CD are worth having in your collection, you should be aware that the 1993 compilation IF EVERY DAY WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS includes everything here, as well as every other Christmas recording Presley ever made. That CD is only (...a little) more than this one and is the Elvis Christmas disc of choice."
1,Not as advertised & not worth it,"I don't normally write reviews but I have to this time because I'm kind of ticked. They are advertised as 3"" x 6"" but they are really 2.75"" x 5"". That plus shipping being $13 for 12 (2 orders of 6 candles) moves me to give it a thumbs down. $44 total for 12 undersized candles - not worth it."
2,Printing quality,"The only reason that I give this book a rating as low as two is solely due to the horrible printwork. The image quality is appalling and paper quality very low. As everyone within electronmicroscopy knows the image quality is essential and here are all images pixelated covering important information. Knowing the original book it has been a tremendous disapointment and knowing the high standard of the author, I am sure he would be more than displeased if he saw this publication.The content as such is brilliant and would normally give a rating of 5."
4,Hit First. Hit Hard. Hit Fast.,"A good book dealing with one of the cardinal rules of a street fight: Hit first. Being from a Wing Chun background I prefer simple yet powerful attacks in the trapping range using chain punches (straight blast), elbows, knees and a few other strikes. I prefer practicing just a few techniques but mastering them. I would recommend Paul Vunak's ""Anatomy of a Streetfight"" for the simple yet powerful approach."
4,Good Basic Self Defence Manual,"""First Strike"" is a great book on basic self defence. Even better than the techniques described is the Gung-Ho, get-the-job-done attitude that Franco tries to instill in the reader. The book isn't perfect, however. Most of the book's photos show the author himself as the defender. The image of trim, muscular Sammy Franco performing the techniques doesn't help those readers who happen to be thin, short, elderly or female, for example. Franco's short discussion of ground fighting should have been left out entirely because it gives no useful advice on to how to defend yourself on the ground. The suggested reading list includes only titles by (you guessed it) Franco himself. On the plus side, ""First Strike"" is valuable because it draws on the real-world experience of the author. Franco's message is as simple and direct as the techniques depicted in the book. A welcome additional to my self defence library."
4,More brilliant Kiwi rock,"Having introduced my english flatmates to the joy of NZ music, they're now hooked. My Boyfriend has added this album to him list of favorites and eagerly awaits my obtaining their second album so he can steal it. Yet more proof that Kiwi music is sorly inderrated."
1,Bad blu ray,"Sadly this blu ray is no better than the DVD, film grain, no HD picture quality, do your wallet a favor, do NOT waste your money on this, it is trash as far as a blu ray goes folks. Sorry foks, waste of money."
3,He runs again.,"You know all the gags, but yo still laugh.Time after time, a movie aging in beauty.Nielson, Kennedy, Presley, a smart starring."
3,A Great,"In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever...those who like Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase will like this movie. I was displease however when I noticed two short scenes were cut out (scratching the desk and shot in the umpires vest). Why I don't know, but if it was based on space, I'd rather have the FULL original movie than some dumb commentary...honestly, who actually watches them? All in all it really is a good movie, just wished they kept it together."
2,I actually preffered the TV Show,"Some comedies just do not hold up. Enter The Naked Gun. I have the TV Show on VHS and have watched it for so long and I had seen these NG movies sooo long ago, that I just assumed 'they were good.' I rented this last night and man, this movie just isn't very good. It has good bits like Frank looking through the microscope with his closed eye, but many many gags are long winded and simply not funny (like the urination scene). This comedy works better on TV b/c it is a faster medium. Making unfunny jokes much longer doesn't make them funnier it makes them tedious. Also, the acting is just not any good, I much preffered the TV cast to OJ and company."
2,"Missed the target, on this one....","Okay, this was an okay movie. I mean, Leslie Nielsen is a truely great comedic and legendary actor. But, this movie has a very lame storyline. It's just pure cheese."
5,Great Movie,"This 1988 movie directed by David Zucker (Airplane, other Naked Gun movies) is extremely funny with a lot of laughs. It stars Leslie Nielsen as cop Frank Drebbin who has to foil an attempt to assassinate the queen. Some other characters are Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) who he falls in love with. Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) the villain, his friend Nordberg (OJ Simpson) and Capt.Ed Hocken (George kennedy). This is a very funny movie which most people should enjoy."
4,...,This movie will always be a favorite of mine due to how funny it was it shows th 80's was comedy's best decade. ...
4,A COP AS DANGEROUS AS THE CRIMINALS HE CHASES.,"""The Naked Gun"" is a collection of jokes, every scene has something funny and most of the jokes still are enjoyable after 16 years. The main character, Lt. Frank Drebin, is the most clueless creature in the planet, but without a doubt he is a very charismatic character that helps to create very funny situations.The creative team ZAZ (David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker) wrote a screenplay filled with jokes and scenes ridiculously funny. From the title sequence (the police car sneaking in the most unimaginable places) to the final scene, you get the feeling that ""The Naked Gun"" is a very good comedy.Perhaps the most ironic and funny thing is that Frank Drebin never realizes all the accidents and disasters he provokes, and even though the danger is always following him, he is a very funny character. If you like comedy, you should see this one."
5,This CD will have you thinking about your childhood!,"Baseball Songs Sports Heroes is perfect for that road trip between ballpark cities and makes for a great gift for any baseball fan. I particularly enjoyed ""Fenway,"" ""Baseball's Mortal Sin (about the New York Yankees),"" ""God's not a Mets Fan,"" and ""Babe Ruth's Curse 1 and 2""!"
1,baseball songs for church,"Way to churchy, too much God and baseball. I didn't know it was a gospel CD."
2,No safety seal,"The bottles that arrive most likely won't look like the picture. I recieved bottles and lids losely in a box. If this was something for myself I might not care, but every baby item I purchase I have always made sure it is sealed for sanitary reasons - most of the items I purchase are Medela and they have the safety seal stating that if the seal is broken, the item cannot be returned, which i like - it makes me feel safer about the products I am purchasing. However, if I use the bottles, it will be helpful that I can freeze then un-freeze and feed without having to transfer from a bag to a bottle."
1,Bottles are not as they appear in photo,"I ordered directly from BabyBecause and the bottles are not as they appear in the photo at all. Packaging is totally different, no pink caps and different logo. The product probably works fine, but I'm giving this only a one-star rating because of the vendor. I contacted them and while they are willing to take the product back, they will not issue any kind of refund for shipping. They insist that the product is the same and that they did not advertise a specific COLOR bottle."
2,EWWWWWWW,"i'm srry to say it, but this pills smell! i just got them like 10 minutes ago, and when i opened the bottle igot the nose full of stink! i'm afraid to take them...soill just order some more pills, but notfrom action labs"
3,"Nice mix, nothing new","While I enjoy Dan the Automator and this CD, for those who have many of the albums he collaborated on, there's nothing new here.Still, that's not to say the music isn't good. I don't think Dan has put out anything I don't like."
4,"Good Video Picture Quality, Missing Extras","I bought the DVD version last XMAS for my family and it was awesome. Great sound and picture and the extras are great...just about every known Elton TV performance (most from the 70's, some never broadcast). I liked this so much, I gave it to myself this XMAS. It's as I remembered it...it's in hi-def, so the pix are excellent in Blu-ray. The extra disk is sadly missed, however. Caveat Emptor! My own fault, of course...I should have read the description more carefully. I'm still giddy from the new PDP and BD player purchase, apparently. I had to have this in BD but should have just bought the standard-def DVD to get the extras and saved the extra dosh. They could have included the extras for the price, but didn't. Oh well, live and learn!"
4,Spot the celebs,"This Bluray DVD has first rate video quality and the 5.1 PCM audio sounds great. It's probably true that a younger Elton had more vocal range, but that's not to say that this performance is bad. I enjoyed this DVD. It would have been better for this Bluray DVD if Elton and band members were in more colorful costume (surprised to see Elton in black), but just the same the video looks great. You'll have fun trying to name all the celebrity's that the camera picks out of the audience during the performance."
4,Hard to navigate,"I totally agree with the above 5 star ratings. Content and quality is great. I just wish I knew how to navigate to a song I want to play. Menu functions are mostly nonexistent as far as choosing a song beyond #13. There are so many songs, I love, just wish I could navigate to the ones I want to hear. Its probably just my not understanding the functions of the menu, but still very confusing."
3,old stale stuff,this material is obscure to say the best about it . Elton has so many great songs to sing why fill an album with such pure crap .
4,60 and still going...,Great album ! He can still rock those oldies and ... we still go for it !Great collection of old documentaries !Keep on going Sir !
5,Elton Magic at MSG - (his 60th show) Blu-ray review,"Excellent price - Phenomenal 60th MSG concert. Elton holds record for number of concerts at this venue. Elton and Paul McCartney really give you bang for your concert buck and are living legends- They play for hours and hours it seems and the songs are as fresh as when they were released. The joy in the audience is palpable. Unbelievably good music. Band, backing children/youth choir, production values all brilliant. Blu-ray video/audio quality are top notch. I can listen to this non-stop over and over. It really is that good. Thanks Elton."
2,Don't Buy Unless you Have HDMI Receiver!!,"Strangely, this concert only has uncompressed HDMI audio and a lackluster 2-channel PCM track. If you still can only decode compressed audio with your receiver( Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1)then DON'T BUY this title. Don't believe what you might read on the packaging. What a shame-since this was probably his last great performance on video. The video editing was a little manic....but what can you do in the age of ADHD and short attention spans?"
2,Elton John's unsuccessful concert.,"I am very disappointed . The songs were performed different , not like the original which i love them so much . The performens of the magnificent songs that i admired were performed so unpleasant .I am sade for buying this CD ( blu-ray )."
1,It is not a good blu ray,"Really horrible sound. It is incredible that a blu ray has such a bad quality of sound. Of the worse thing to that I have never listened. The DvD greatest hits live of 2004 has a spectacular sound, whereas this blu ray performs the worse thing that I have listened never.Buy to this blu ray is to throw the money."
2,Sad...very sad!,Technically this is a great disc. Great audio and video presentation. Pity that Elton's voice can't match. It's croaky and indistinct on many of the tracks. Very disappointing. He should have quit while he was ahead!
1,defective,Too bad! I really wanted to be able to listen to Elton but the disks I received were totally blank. Tried it twice but the whole batch was blotto.
5,The Best Blue Ray Concert Available,"If your an Elton fan as I am and enjoy the hits from early Elton as I do, then don't hesitate to buy this blue ray. I thought it was going to be good when I bought it, but then I was blown away. That man can still rock. I only wish I could have seen it live!!!!!!!!"
4,About as good as it gets in video,Would have loved to hear more of the old stuff. But a great performance none the less. Amazing clarity on the Blue ray. Clear and awesome sound stage. You can see the hairs on his hands when Elton is playing.
5,60 years on,"He may be bit older, a bit heavier, and his voice a bit deeper now, but this show is fantastic. With a big group of chorus singers to flesh out those songs with unforgettable harmonies, and several of the original Elton John band along with him, these guys pull off a serious rock show. And the stage set is pretty remarkable too. If you were ever a fan, this is one for the library. The quality of audio and video of the Bluray version is superb. I highly recommend it."
3,Elton John DVD,"This was Elton John's 60th birthday celebration. Some of the entertainers & accolades were flat. Elton was probably doing a good job, BUT the DVD was ""scheechy"" when the sound pitch elevated. It was very distracting to have such a poor audio. Basically, it was a disgrace for such a marvelous performer to have a production entity do such a horrible job with the audio. Would not recommend it to anyone who wants to ACTUALLY WANTS TO HEAR THE MUSIC."
4,Elton live at MSG,"This is a great dvd. Lots of Elton's songs played as only he can play them. I knew what to expect when i bought this as a friend of mine had it and i heard parts of it. It's well worth the cost, something Elton fans need in their music library."
4,Great music but hard to watch,"Love Elton and this was a good show, Im not sure about the dancing shirtless male in the background giant screen and the constant panning the crowd for all the young men and older women reliving there past with overdramatic sing alongs. But if you can deal with the non music distractions its a great show."
3,The good and the bad,"EJ still shines as a performer and a musician. Really great audio mix. Really poor video direction. Over 30 songs. Not ONE dissolve! Cut very poorly and very nonsensical. If you're looking for a nice ""music video"", this aint it. It's all about the music here."
3,it does not contain the extras that the DVD possesses,"sends these people only write comments on the blu ray, only if you purchased the DVD, do not put misinformation and frivolous, the blu ray only contains the wonderful concert madison square garden and nothing else, possesses the booklet with some photos and below the dvd, that poor editing mr elton john released this type of media, since the DVD has all the extras that should have the blu ray ..."
5,Fantástico!,"O presente de aniversário foi o Elton para todos nós. Trs horas de um dos melhores shows que já vi. Faltaram algumas músicas como Skyline Pigeon, Candle in the Wind, entre outras. Mas no comprometeu. Os arranjos esto fantásticos e o Coral de Adolescentes do Brooklin, magnífico. Para comprar e assistir sempre."
5,EVERY night is allright for Rockin!!!,What an incredible package...the concert celebrating his 60th ...birthday and MSG show...are great and filmed well performed well...just a thrilling collection of all time greatest hits and lesser played but still great songs!the bonus stuff (vintage filmed performances through the years and with many early tv appearances) is a treasure trove for fans that frankly would be worth this price on their own!and a nice fat booklet with a bunch of great pix...this is NOT a cheap money grab like so many DVDs...this is CLASS!FABULOUSI had almost forgot why I loved Elton as a high schooler in the 70's...he was our Beatles in that respect..happy Birthday Elton..Keep Rockin!
4,great video,"THE VIDEO QUALITY IS SUPERB YOU CAN SEE THE HAIRS ON HIS KNUCKLES AS HE PLAYS I JUST LONG FOR THE OLD ELTON'S VOICE.HE DOESN'T REALLY SING THE SONG LIKE THEY'RE HIS AND HE LOST ALOT OF RANGE. I'M A LONG TIME FAN AND CAN REMEMBER WHEN HE SANG LIKE HE CARED.LIKE THE SONG WAS PART OF HIM. I EVEN PURCHASED THE BOX SET THAT HAS THE STANDARD DEF VIDEO BECAUSE OF THE RARITIES VIDEOS, FROM THE SEVENTIES.THE VIDEO QUALITY STNKS BUT THE CONTENT IS SPECTACULAR.CHECK IT OUT HE SHOULD RELEASE MORE OLD STUFF.HE WAS REALLY THE BEST IN THE 70'S."
4,A Legend,"The songs are there....the band is there......the magic is there. The only very minor downside is Robin Williams, who never seems to know when to shut-up, who continued to rattle on when Bernie Taupin was making his tribute to Elton. Come on Robin, have we not heard enough of you?Otherwise, a great DVD by the Master himself."
5,Elton 60 Live At Madison Square Garden,This video is worth every penny. It is Elton John at his absolute best. It also includes unseen footage that was recorded at different concerts through out EnglandThis is a must have for any Elton John fan.
4,Good performance.,"Elton John's concert DVD for his 60th birthay is completely infectious. Elton sings and plays his heart out, you can feel his passion for the music and there's a lot of famous faces in the crowd cheering him on. Songs like Your Song, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word, Something About the Way You Look Tonight, Benny and the Jets, The #itch is Back, and Tiny Dancer are the highlights here. Elton has an amazing talent, I highly recommend this excellent concert!"
5,Elton the elder,The concert was longer than expected. A very pleasant surprise. The music was great. Good to see old clips. The voice of the older Elton isn't quite as good. But good enough to enjoy thouroughly. Enjoyed it.
4,great but need more,"Elton can still sing and the old songs still sound great but wouldn't it be fantastic to have a show of all the wonderful music he's done in the last 20 years. There wouldn't be much time for old songs if he played all the best of his newer material. Yes, he's done The Bridge, Can You Feel the Love, Sacrifice, Simple Life, The One and I Want Love on DVD. But how about Never Knew Her Name, Runaway Train, Please, Made In England, The End Will Come, Live Like Horses, Long Way From Happiness, The Wasteland, They Call Her the Cat, Weight of the World, or Just Like Noah's Ark. These songs need to be captured on video."
4,This BD-ROM comes with 1080/60i with PCM 5.1 ot PCM 2.0,"Video resolution is 1080i (1080/60i), but no big deal. Picture quality is awesome, and so is the uncompressed PCM 5.1 sound. This concert was 3:16 hours long, wow! As for titles, I was a bit disappointed, because there weren't too many real hits present (only towards the the last third of the concert). Again, excellent audio and video quality."
2,Blue-Ray,"I was disappointed in the video picture quality for this Blue-Ray title. It look like a 480P DVD picture. The Dolby 5.1 audio sound was another disappointment; thin sounding, no punch. They didn't use DTS 5.1 audio sound. Why?"
1,What a disappointment,"I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past; however, the description on Amazon is incorrect. This is NOT a 3 pair pack, it is only one pair of socks for $13.99 plus shipping. What a rip-off. I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack"
5,Colors were perfect!,"The colors brown and royal blue we ordered were a perfect match to the samples on the page. The only downside is how long these socks are. My 5 and 7 year olds are tall for their age, in 90% percentile, and they came up to mid-thigh on the 5 year old and just above the knee on the 7 year old. They love wearing them, but for hot summer baseball games, we have to roll them down or use different socks. Great price for 3 pairs and shipped quickly."
5,"Dude can lay it down, soulful and pretty","Tim Bowman is well known in the smooth jazz genre and it is my pleasure to make him better known as he surely merits. A Christian man of God, Tim takes the freedomof music and creates 'new songs' that captivate the ear bent towards pretty, smooth, relaxing. Much like Earl Klugh has done, Tim is continuing and with his own sharp and crisp soloing and soul.Brian Jett (A friend, but too a huge fan)"
5,I am glad he chose music over basketball!!,"After hearing this magnificent work of art and holy inspiration, Ben is the one I will listen to for jazz from now on!! If you are a jazz fan BUY THIS ALBUM as well as any other by Ben. He is greatly talented, you can't help but get into the groove."
4,Fascinating Introduction to Geology,"This is the first Nature Company Guide I've ever read. I had always thought DK Guides were the very best. This book has piqued my interest in other Nature Company Guide books. This particular book offers beautiful photography, thought-provoking bits of trivia related to geological phenomena throughout history. Compared to a DK Guide on fossils, this book is more narrative in tone, and more conceptual in its presentation. Very nicely done."
2,"Very boring, and low budget film","My family and I are fans of BBC/ Masterpiece Theater series and after watching the BBC Our Mutual Friend, were looking forward to another wonderful adaptation of one of Dickens' novels. However, we were disappointed with this production. The acting is good but there are two major problems: 1)it dragged tremendously; it seemed like it went on forever and nothing ever happened in it; and 2)it was a very low-budget production. It looked as if it had been filmed on two stages and the quality of the film was extremely poor."
5,Islands Magazine is the next best thing to being there,"I have taken the publication for years and find it to be one of the most quality produced publication on the islands of the world.Islands themselves have a romantic appeal, one that people want to escape to. I can atest to that. I left the U.S. for two years and lived in the South Pacific country of Vanuatu and have since traveled to many other islands of the world.For those islands I haven't visited I use Islands magazine to take me there..Enjoy..."
4,Great in-depth articles on little known islands,"As avid travelers (and lover of islands, specifically), my husband & I love getting our Islands. Sometimes it gives us great ideas as a jumping off point for our next vacation... other times, well-written articles accompanied by beautiful photography makes us book a vacation to that spot. Yes, there are helpful articles about the big islands: Hawaii, Fiji, Bali, Society Islands (Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora)... but this is the magazine to turn to if you're going to Aitutaki, or one of the many islands in Southeast Asia.I wouldn't really rely on Islands as a budget travel guide, but more of an inspiration as to which island to head to next."
3,Not enough pictures,"I was hoping this magazine would be filled with vibrant pictures of different ""island"" destinations but it's not. I'm really big on pictures and if a place is visually appealing to me, I GO! Too bad this magazine is not like that. Has a lot of writing / articles which is great if you enjoy reading :) I was hoping for more of a ""picture"" book"
1,70% ads 20% photos 10% articles,"I used to be a subscriber of this magazine, believing it would have some interesting articles about islands - boy was I wrong. You could think the folks at this magazine are illiterate, and are only thinking about the money. All there is to this magazine are loads and loads, pages beyond pages of advertisement. Not even interesting advertisements but more for the rich and wealthy. In between are a few nice photos, and maybe they throw in a couple of articles, which can all be finished in about 7 minutes. No need to say, I cancelled my subscription."
5,Teaser for dream vacations,"This has unbelievable photos of the most spectacular places in the world. If you cant go there, at least you can dream. Neat magazine."
3,Great photography,"Playboy, I get for the articles. Islands, it's really just about the pictures. ;-) Seriously, the articles are not very interesting or well written, but the photography is nice. Makes for great dreaming ..."
3,well,Its an okay magazine but it doesn't get you all dreamy eyed like Caribbean life and style magazine does.
1,Males vs. Females?,"I bought this game not long ago and was irritated at the way men are represented on the career cards. On EVERY card, a woman is shown as the competent employee and the man as incompetent. This is NOT what I want to teach my children. (By the way, I am a woman.)"
2,Received Game with Missing Parts,"Great game. However, we purchased this new from Amazon and when we opened it and went through the directions, we realized that we were missing all of the College Career cards, and some of the regular Career cards. Hardly what we would expect from ordering a new game. Since we had already gone through the trouble of applying the labels, etc., it is too much of a hassle to ship it back. Now we have to send money to Hasbro to have them send us an extra card deck. In hindsight, we should have purchased the game at Walmart or Target."
5,Childhood Favorite!!!!!!!!!,You cant go wrong with this game....this was my favorite game as a child....bought this for my children when they were younger and it just so happens that my 17 year old and her friends are actually playing this game right now....they absolutely love this game......you can never be to young or old to play this game
3,Family fun.,"We enjoyed this game, which is good for largish groups, but it did take an age to put together. Overall, a lot of fun."
3,Old game rules still rules...,"My son recently resurrected my old Life game which he found in the back of my closet. I remember playing and it was fun but the spinner was really awful. Someone told me, back in the day, that if I put Vaseline on the base it would spin better. That spinner was lubed better than a one month old with a high temp. But alas it was still pretty lame. I told my son we couldn't play without a good spinner and we needed the numbers 1 through 10. He came up with a ten sided die (from another game called break the safe) and it worked great. No more spinner and the old original rules. What could be better? If you get the opportunity to get your hands on an older version I would suggest you jump on it. Lots of fun, alot less random, and a few good life lessons to boot. Skip the newfangled Life (with the life tiles). In this case old rules rules."
2,Too much to it!,This game requires a lot of education before playing it. I read and reread the directions and still got confused. I'll have to study it.
1,"This toy/game is great, but we got ripped off by this seller","We thought we were buying a ""Game of Life"" and when we got it it had been shipped in two Trader Joes brown paper bags and tied with string, and the game was a simpsons version, I do not like the simpsons and would not have bought this had I known, plus the game was listed as like new and the box was completely falling apart... ridiculous."
3,It's not like the one I had as a kid!,Wish I had kept my 1970's version of it. The quality was much better. This one took quite a bit to set it up.
2,Not as good as the original,"I'm sorry, but the original version was MUCH more fun. This version has become too childish. Can kids not think any more or what?? Why are all the games being dumbed down in the new versions????"
1,The new version stinks!,The new version is no fun to play. I bought it because I wanted to share a game that I loved as a child with my son! I played the banker and was totally fried by the end of the game because of all the things with which you have to do and keeping track of how many pay raise each person had to pay them each time. It was not fun!
2,Not the same as I remember,"If you played this game 15 years ago you remember a different game. I played it all the time with my friends and loved it - so as an adult I bought it. Well they have updated the rules and other things with the times and I cannot say that I enjoyed these changes. If your children have never played the older version, then they will probally not feel let down. I miss the game of my childhood..."
2,The Facts of Life,"My daughter received Life as a birthday present and I was very excited to play, thinking it would bring back great memories! Unfortunally they tried to ""improve"" on a classic and totally ruined it. The spinner derails on every spin and my daughter can barely get it to go around once. You have to assemble the board everytime and pray you get the houses in the right spots, instead of it being fixed and ready to play like the GOOD version. The people fall out of the cars and are so microscopic, I'm sure the vacuum cleaner will find them before I do. There are these strange ""Life"" cards that make no sense whatsoever, debunking the whole purpose of earning any real money. There are no gifts from the other players when you get married or have kids. In fact, there's no reason now to even have kids! That was the whole fun of the game, piling in as many as possible into the car! I will gladly pay more for the ""real"" version. I guess it's time to go find one at a yard sale or Ebay....."
3,Why?,"Why did Hasbro dumb down the Game of Life? I remember playing as a child and getting points for each child and being able to gamble away all my money and take revenge on other players. It was a fun, challenging game. Now it is just a board game where you get some money. If they wanted a game younger people could play they could have made a child's version and an adult version. I miss the original!"
1,A classic game ruined.,"I am 24 and have played the original version countless times from the time I was a very small child. The new version has added several new and VERY confusing rules, changed the colors of the money (Which is only bad if you have the first version memorized), added many new parts which will just get lost, and have made it a more mean spirited game. It is now too confusing and boring for younger children (Under the age of 10-12). I truley wish my mother had not thrown away my first version just because the box was beyond destroyed."
2,What happened?,"I used to LOVE ""The Game of Life."" A friend and I bought this over the summer for her nine year-old son. What a disappointment! The board is difficult to assemble, the pieces pop out of the slots throughout the game, and the spinner doesn't work very well. They also added these strange and meaningless cards basically makes the millionaire spot pointless, and they also changed the stock market. I really hope my dad hasn't thrown away my original game, because this one is not what I remembered."
1,New rules/gameplay- unsatisfactory,"Maybe I just dislike change, but when I purchased this game, I was very excited, only to be crestfallen when I set it up and played it.The rules and gameplay have been drastically altered, as is the quality and set up. You must set up the board every time you play it, inserting the useless little houses on the board, and setting up the bridges. While they're okay to look at, if we have to set the game up like that every time, it's not worth it. Print the whole board if you can't box it properly. The gameplay is not as good as the old version, period. I remember playing the previous version and frankly, this one just doesn't measure up. I wish they would re-release the previous version!"
2,Find the old version and buy that,This is nothing like the old version. I hate the life cards. You can't tell how well you're doing. There aren't any gifts for getting married or having kids - it's meaningless. The game just got boring and I love games.
3,Disappointed with changes,"I bought this game for my new family for Christmas. This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember playing for countless hours as a child. First of all, my old game had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly attached to the game board. With the new version, all of these things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board. Also, the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot. The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car. Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial. I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future."
2,New Version of The Game of Life,"We looked forward to the day when our two daughters were old enough to play the game of life with us--a game we so much enjoyed as kids. We bought them a current version in 2001 and have been very disappointed. We had no idea that a game that had been great just the way it was had been changed. It is more difficult to play and geared more toward older kids--probably teens. There are now life tiles which add nothing to the game at all. The players can decide to buy stocks, insurance policies, take out bank loans. Players pick their own careers as well as their salaries and even which home they will buy. Requires strategic financial planning. Also, the money amts. involved get very high making counting work, not fun. In addition, our board folds up and is already falling apart on the folds and we take very good care of our games! We miss the old Life!! This new version is too complicated for younger kids."
3,Not the LIFE I grew up with,"For some reason the corporate big shots have altered one of the classic games. The game has been dumbed down slightly and they have also added new aspects to the game. This is not the game I grew up with. I bought this game in 2001 and have only played it twice. Had this been the original game of LIFE I would be playing it once every few weeks. I can't say that it is a bad game, it's just a disappointment. I'm keep it and play it again (probably more when I have kids) but I'm also going to get my parents to ship my old version to me so I can play the game I love."
2,Don't Buy,"This games has way to many rules to understand unless you are a professor or someting. They ruined a classic and is very hard to play. The LIFE cards make no sense and the part about being married and having kids is just a spot on the board and as no part in the game. If I were you, I would go to all the garage and antics stores I could find and look for the original. Good luck hunting."
2,Changed for the Worse,"LIFE was one of my favortie games when I was a kid. I got this game for my kids, thinking it would be the same great game. So many parts of the game have changed. It might be that the changes were meant to make it 'more real'- like losing your job, choosing the family path, etc. But it is not nearly as fun as the old game. My kids will play both versions, but they like the old one better as well. Thank goodness my parents still had my old one up in the closet!"
4,Recommended game for family,"Its absoultely fun game! I started playing 2 years ago. But rite now, as I'm rather in an adult age, it'll be passed down to my younger cousins.Can anyone be so kind to email a copy of game instructions because I can't seem to find it. Thanks alot!!!"
5,LIFE IS THE GAME!!!!,"Life helps kids balance money and while they're having fun (which is very important in any Board Game). Math skills are known to be very important in life EVERYWHERE!!! So the excellent game being provided called L.I.F.E dose show any kids who play the difficulties, experiences and good things that are truly a part of life. Also, don't even think I'll stop there! The game L.I.F.E has a little thing that's called match the letters at the begining of the game while setting up.Some of the many things that makes L.I.F.E such an exciting game are...1. Colorful2. Career, Married, House, Stock & insurance3. Fun cars with plastic people that you insert to actually show who's in your family (in the game).4. The Comments and good and fair decisions on the gameboard's road.5. The little extra things that make the game more fun.That's just some! Soo have the fun filled board game or computer game, L.I.F.E flood your house.Don't miss out!!!"
2,Dumb,"I never cared for this game, I always thought it was silly and really didn't offer much in the way of strategy or skill.I can't think of anything really good to say about it, but I know it's been around for some time, so some people must get into it. If you like strategy and logic or word games like I do, you'll probably want to pass on this one."
4,The earlier edition from the 70s was more fun,"Still, this game is highly educational and could be used to teach children about finances. Players must pick a career, manage a salary and family, and deal with various windfalls and pitfalls as they play- auto accidents (and they can buy insurance against this!), houses burning down, stock market crashes. Fun for everyone, including adults, and the whole family can enjoy it together. Just be careful of the small pieces if you have kids under the age of six or so. The cars and ""people pegs"" would be easy to swallow"
4,The Game,I think that Life is a great game and that people should lower down the price since Christmas is coming.
2,Boring and Pointless,"This is not the game of ""Life"" that I remember. Going around the board and randomly collecting money, tiles, etc. Then, at the end you are either a millionaire or go to the Country Estate. Either one seems like winning. Half of the fun in the old game was to see who ended up in the ""poor house"". It has some good educational value as far as learning to count money, buy insurance, etc. But, we don't really enjoy playing it much."
4,Fun Family Time,"I enjoyed this game as a child. While this version is not the same as the original, it is still a lot of fun if you look at it as an opportunity to spend time with your kids. It is labeled as a game for children 9 years and older, however, this is totally dependent on your children as individuals and how patient you are. My daughter and son are now 5 and 6 1/2 years old. We started playing when they were 4 and 5 1/2 years old. Sure, they needed help with reading and counting the money but we had a great time nonetheless and they have learned a lot in the process. They are learning turn taking, math, reading skills and how to lose a game with dignity (not easy at any age). Also, it's given me an opportunity to reinforce some of our values (the importance of going to college and getting married before having children)."
5,Puts a smile on my face,"This is my favourite board game. It is just so fun to get money, get married, have kids (twins is so sweet!) and add the little blue and pink people to your car. I love landing on a ""Baby girl!"" or ""Twins!"" or some other cute square. It is a lot of fun, and not as competitive as ""Monopoly"" and not as challenging as ""Scrabble"" It's a really neat game, and it was a really good idea! : )"
3,more complex than the game I played as a kid,takes a while to set up and younger kids may not have the patience to play all the way to the end
3,Not As Good As The Original,"I love The Game Of Life as kid growing up (ours was from the mid-70's). We played it a hundred times at least. So when my wife and I bought ""our own"" copy when we got married, we were greatly disappointed with the ""new and improved"" version that is currently for sale. The new version has done away with alot of the fun characteristics of the game and seems to have watered down the game play to make it easier (i.e. less fun). We were so disappointed, we sold our copy and bought one of the old ones through Ebay.So if you grew up playing Life, love it, and you are older than say 20 yrs old, don't bother buying a new copy - you won't like it. Scour Ebay and get one of the classic versions."
2,Who's Life is this?????!,"I played this ""new"" Life version with my children who range from age 7 - 12 and I was highly disappointed. I guess I remember the old version and I couldn't grasp the idea that I had to have a career card and a salary card that someone could swap with me at any given moment during the game. And what is with those Life cards that range from $50,000 - $200,000. Get real! When in life can you move a couple paces and receive that much cash. There were some highlights to the game that I thought were pretty cool, like the night school switch career thing, paying taxes, etc. I however did not like the fact that you had to get married, had waaaaay too much money, no one hit the poor farm, etc. I want the old version back! On a positive note, my kids love this game! I'm just spoiled by the old version."
1,Lousy game for kids,"If you are looking for an educational game for the kids, forget Life. Waste of money. You spin and move, no thinking necessary. Get's boring fast. Maybe some slight value in counting money but other than that the only choices needed are which route you take when there is a fork in the road. Buy Monopoly instead!"
4,It's Still A Classic,"I bought this for my 8 & 11 year old girls as an extre inexpensive Christmas gift, and I was pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it."
1,Painful & Pointless,"I purchased this game for Xmas last year. I waited on line for 30 minutes to pay for this game. I heard that they changed it. But when I saw that the box was similar to the older version, I thought they changed it back. It was a ploy to fool us into buying this game.I don't know what possessed Milton Bradley to change the old game! I gave this one to a thrift store and purchased an older version off of ebay. It was worth the [money] to revisit the classic version. The older version of Life ties with Monopoly for my favorite games."
2,This is not your father's Game of Life,"I loved this game as a child. When my son got it for Christmas, I looked forward to playing. The first thing I noticed was the flimsy board -- you have to put it together every time you play, which is not fun.The spinner is an absolute nightmare. I spent two days thinking I must have put it together wrong only to learn from other parents that it is just like that. I can't quite figure out what they were thinking at Hasbro. Were they TRYING to make it as hard as possible to spin the spinner without it falling off track? If so, they did an outstanding job. I truly miss hearing that pppppppttttttbzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sound when you spin the Life spinner as hard as you can.One positive: I sort of like the fact that you get to choose your job and home -- it helped my son look at a variety of factors to decide what a ""good"" job was and he had a good laugh at having to choose between the mansion and the shack."
4,Life!,"I really love this game. Even though I'm a little old for board games I love playing this game with my little cousins. Its all about the game of life. Getting married, getting a job, and retiring- all in one little board game. I tottaly reccomend this game to anyone over the age of about 9 to have a great time with their family and have a few laughs! Please, check this game out. I loved it!"
3,Origional version was better.,"We bought this for our 6 year old for Christmas. She really likes it and we have a lot of fun playing it as a family. However, I don't care for some of the changes that were made the the game to ""up-date"" it. There are lawsuit spaces where you sue another player and personally we are not real fond of the idea of suing others. I guess the bottom line is I liked the original game better."
5,Classic,"My daughter, husband and I have so much fun with this game. It is a classic. Teaches some life lessons but is really fun. You can't go wrong with a classic board game. I wish it had a better money holder and holders for all the special cards but I just put them in zip lock baggies and that keeps them together. The people don't stay in the cars ... they should redesign the pegs that go in the holes in the cars."
3,Steep learning curve,"I bought this as an alternate activity for the English classes I teach to my Korean middle schoolers. I remember thinking fondly of the Game of Life I played as a kid their age and wanting to use it as a way to facilitate discussions and conversations on shopping, careers, and the concept of rich or poor in modern society. That being said... the game is ridiculously hard to learn. I had to read over the game rules four or five times and struggle to help my students learn how to play. They didn't really get some aspects like buying spin cards and and using the tokens. All in all, it was a disaster. If a game has that many different cards and parts and rules, it becomes a bit tedious. Yeah, they have not being fluent in English as an excuse, but even I had a hard time making sense of it all."
2,Not the original!,"Life has been one of my favorite board games since I was a kid. Noticing recently that mine was getting really tattered and missing quite a few pieces I bought a new one. I wish I'd read the reviews here first though because the new one is NOT the same as the classic Game of Life. They made an attempt to modernize it and the result is cheesy and ridiculous, with less strategy involved. If you want the game you know and love from childhood, do NOT buy this! Absolute garbage, I'm annoyed to have wasted my money."
5,Extremely fun!,"Life is a really fun game to play. It is really durable, and it is educational--it let's you figure out how to handle money, insurance, and stuff like that. I would recommend it highly."
2,"Disappointing, if you played the 60s game","This version is politically correct, not as risky or challenging and just plain boring. The fun is gone and replaced with pap. Look for the older game at yard sales and auctions. Maybe you'll find the original (like checkers). Haven't played that one yet!"
5,Life's More than This,"This is one of the better known classic board games, although they changed a bit of the rules for the new ""Life Generation"". The board is a little out of the ordinary --- ""It's a boy!"" in one space, and about six spaces later you get ""You get married"". The pegs are small and are almost definetely going to get lost in your rug or wherever you are playing the game. Otherwise, play the game of Life."
4,ideal,es una forma de crecer e interpretar la vida misma ayuda a mis hijos a enender sobre los gastos y la inversion
5,The new game of life,"The directions are different than before. I recommend reading it before trying to play. The rules are a bit complicated and should be adjusted to fit the players age. (Younger kids may not understand all the new rules so just omit them!) Once I understood the rules and put it together it was decent. Worth the money. I am glad we got it despite the negative reviews! I got it on sale for less than 14 dollars, even better YAY!"
2,Game,"I bought this game as option to entertain when having people over. As it turns out it has way too any pieces, some really small, that made it omplicated when having friends with kids. The game is complicated itself, so rather than spending a couple of hours playing, you need just as much just to set up and to explain since not many people are familiar with it. I ended up giving it away."
3,Fun :),It's a fun game but you need to be patient when first play it. Takes time to set it up. Not suitable for kids <=10 yrs old.
4,Nostalgic,"Just as much fun as I remember. Playing it as an adult, I realize this game was truly a product of the 50's. You had to get a job, had to get married and buy a house. Great family game."
3,Sigh...that's Life...or is it?,"My kids received this game from ""Santa Claus"" this year, and as ""he"" was setting it up under the tree, it was quite disappointing.The cars are made out of flimsy plastic, not even close to the ones you and I remember. The people? Forget about it, because it will be easier to forget about them, then to keep looking for them in your carpet.This game is nothing like the Life game I remember as a kid. For an ""anniversary"" edition, I expected more than what we got. You have to take out the spinner, bridges, and houses every time you put the game away, and reinsert them the next time.The rules are different than the ones I remember, but somewhat fun. I don't mind the rule changes as much as I do the changes to the durability of the game. ....We did enjoy playing it last night, but I will remember this the next time there is a ""new and improved"" anniversary edition of ANY game. Didn't I learn my lesson with Trivial Pursuit Millennium edition? <G>"
2,Bring back the old Life!,"Noticing how my board game collection did not include Life, I went to buy it. Much to my dismay they had changed the game. This game includes cards in which came be switched around between players and little cards in which you receive $50,000-$200,000. It all just seemed way too easy. I used to love Life, one of my favorite games. I never play the new game it's no fun. Funny, I still find myself browsing the game aisle looking to see if they changed it back yet..."
1,Tell MB to quit making this sooo cheap- by not buying it.....,"Ok, here is my gripe. When I was a kid, you took this game out of the box, did the regular passing out of money and other administerial stuff, and away you went. Not with this POS......You have to assemble the whole game, every time you play. That means putting the houses onto the board. You even have to attach the mountains! Maybe I''m getting too old, but the version I had you didn't have to do this. Talk about cheesey. MB make a little less money and atleast give us a pre-assembled board."
2,Don't fix it if it ain't broke!,"I miss the original game of Life. The new version is fine but, for those of us who grew up with the original it's not the same. I would like to see Hasbro offer both versions or go back to the original. My original Life game is tattered but I will continue to play it as opposed to the new game."
1,BEWARE!!! LIFE IS MORE COMPLICATED!!!,"I bought this game at the store for my girls because I remember it being relatively easy and fun as a kid. The creators of this game have made this game so complicated, I as an adult had trouble keeping up with it. I remember playing this as a kid in 3rd grade and having no troubles. There is no way my 4th grader could play this with her friends. LIFE IS WAY TO COMPLICATED (Pun intended). Life was much easier and more fun when I was a kid! They have complicated the fun right out of the game!"
2,"Disappointed- this is a cheaper, changed version of the original","The game is ok, but I was disappointed as this now standard version is a changed, lower budget design of the original game. In general it is cheaply made. A couple pain points is the spinner does not stay in place unless you are very gentle with it, the people always fall out of the cars, and trying to get it all back in the box really does not work.And again, besides the poor quality, the game has been changed I assume to be more politically correct and is not as fun. Try and get the original and skip this version if at all possible.I did see what looked like a much nicer version in a considerably larger box at a major book store retailer (has two names that start with ""B"" and ""N""). It was at least 2x the price I paid, but I again bet a much nicer, higher quality edition worth the money."
1,Not for the young at heart.,"This is a revised version of the original. Almost every detail that made this game spectacular changed. If you enjoyed the original (or have any form of nostalgia for it), avoid this sham. The game has lost its flair."
3,"Good book, but you have to type","This book provides a good introduction to COM, and is very clearly written. It is also more carefully written than most computer books I've seen lately, with relatively few typos.The biggest problem is that there's no CD-ROM included. The source code is supposed to be on the author's web site, along with omitted code samples that he frequently alludes to, but as of this writing, there's NOTHING on the web site. Buyer beware."
2,Needs work.......,"This book leaves a lot to be desired. First it has numerous mistakes. Second the title of the book is way misleading. You will not learn COM from this nor will you even come close as this book is way too general. IMHO this book is a complete waste of money. Granted that it will probably take 3 or 4 books to get COM down but this book deosn't aid you in anyway. The author's idea of laying the foundations of COM is walking you through an example where he leaves out explainations to the point that you can't create your own COM servers without a great deal of additional references. This book is not for C++ developers, its for analysts who need to evaluate technological alternatives or, perhaps, Visual Basic programmers who don't need the underlyings of COM just a high-level overview. In other words this book is of no help to C++ software engineers. Instead check out ""Inside COM"" or ""Essential COM""."
5,Beautifully written but sloppy production,"This book is beautifully written. Very clear explanations. A nice logical flow and obviously the author knows his subject well.However, the production of the book is awful. In the text there is code that is missing. In order to solve the problems in building the examples, I downloaded (ftp) the code from the book site. Some of the downloaded code refused to compile due to missing lines. When finally it compiled and built, it refused to run giving ""Invalid class string"" errors. It is such a shame that such a good book is flawed in this way.In spite of all this, the text is clear and explains the horrors of COM software well.I am glad I bought it."
2,2 Stars,"I was very excited when I read chapters 1-3 as the content was clear and understandable, however the example as described in chapter 4 does not compile. I write lots of technical documentation for a living and I dont understand why these authors (not just this book, in fact a good many of programing books from many publishers) cannot supply working examples. Its just not fair when you dump $40-50 into a book to learn a subject then you have to spend hours figuring out how to get working examples, IF I WANTED TO LEARN THIS WAY I WOULD JUST READ THE COM DOCUMENTATION AND WRITE MY OWN EXAMPLES, I spent $45 for a reason!If it were not for the excellent writing in the first 3 chapters this book would get 1 star like most of the other programming books with flawed examples.I guess its just a money making scam, pump out the books as fast as they can regardless of quality."
4,Great tutorial,As other reviewer's have said this is an excellent book for reader's unfamiliar with COM/DCOM/COM++. Even though the book is plaqued with typos and missing steps. The FTP site contains code that will compile. Note: You should have some MFC and VC++ exposure.
2,If only I'd known...,"...this was Joyce Carol Oates, I'd have passed. I used to be a fan, but the last few books of hers that I've read have left me cold.Same here. She sets up an intriguing protagonist, Lara, and a tantalizing premise. Unfortunately, the promising start leads to a bunch of ""Is that all there is?"" plot developments and revelations, which try hard to be shocking but which telegraph themselves from miles away. None of the characters is plausible or sympathetic. Lara changes her mind so abruptly and often that I finished the book feeling like I'd suffered whiplash. The end left me thinking: ""What an idiot."" I can only assume this isn't the reaction Oates was aiming for.I give this book two stars for the author's deftness with language. Otherwise I think her career would be better served by publishing less, not more. Take a vacation, Ms. Oates."
4,"Compelling, thrilling and ultimately unsettling.","The pace at the start of the story gave me a rush of adrenline.It was superbly crafted, moving in time and presenting the future before the present. The characters were seedy, and the decisions and choices of the protagonist made it hard to root for her. But at the end I accepted her choice along with her.I am not a follower of mainstream thrillers, nor have I ever read Joyce C. Oates. But after this novel, I intend to start."
1,Boring and Trite,"This is one of the slowest books I have read in quite some time. I tried so hard to make it through but I just couldn't do it, I only made it about halfway through. Kelly tells the story in the 3rd person which makes it even more impersonal and dull, I just couldn't bring myself to give a damn about any of the characters! Maybe there was a story in there somewhere, but I couldn't get through enough of it to find out. Much better books out there....."
1,Design Flaw,"I picked one of these up in my search for an affordable compressor. The compressor action itself was quite nice, but the pedal also would sometimes pick up radio stations when engaged. That's totally unacceptable! Stay away."
3,classic ya seires,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Good series, overall. but prefer the Immortals series."
5,Thank you Tamora Pierce!,"In the Hand of the Goddess is an excellent book, when I first got it I didn't get to sleep until after midnight because I had to finish it, I just couldn't put it down. Since then I have reread it at least ten times. This book mixes up magic, adventure,and romance, into the story of Allana's life as she fulfills her destiny. It is a wonderful book that me and several other people I know enjoy, if you have not read it it is definitly worth it."
4,KNIGHT VISION,"hello again.This book continues on from THE FIRST ADVENTURE and it is alright, not as good as the one before or after it, but alright.Alanna and Jon are to go to war, she gets kidnapped and of course Jon, the brave, goes out and rescues her. Myles shares his feelings about thinking Alanna is a girl to Jon. And the inevetible happens: SHOCK HORROR! Alanna and Jon go and have sex. of course they fall in love first, but it is still so predictable.Even if the story is not all great, the characters are. Don't get me wrong or anything, some parts of this book are excellent, but the other works of Ms Pierce's are better."
5,This book is awsome!!!,"This book is original and totally cool. You can't get bored and you'll want to read it again and again. It introduces a new world, new people, new adventures, and best of all, MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! It made me want to go live there and be buds with Alanna and do the same things she did. I was happy about the magic... and loved to hear about magic because I believed it really excisted!!!!!"
5,Great book but what happend to Gary,Great book but what happend to Gary the page who helped trainAlanna he was running even with George and Prince Jonathon to marryAlanna
5,A wonderfully written story,Alanna has become Jonathon's squire. she will face her greatest enemy in this book. She will learn how to love and she will face up to her three greatest fears. Alanna will prove to all Tortall that she has earned the shield she set out to conquer.In this book you will read the what Alanna does on her way on becoming a legend.
3,"Good Characters, Horrible Plot","The characters in this book are sincere, deep and very funny to read about. Alanna is coragous and daring, but soft and pokable at the same time.But, despite the really good characters and their personalities, I didn't like this book. The main character seemed bossy, rude and too eager. If you fought in a army, you woundn't jump at the occasion to fight!But, most of all, there were some...uh...romance in this novel that scared me a little. Well, a lot. The girl dates and makes out with a lot of people in htis book, and more than I have fingers to count.A good adventure if your desperrate. But, only if all the copies of Harry Potter are gone, I don't recommend this book."
1,A real let-down,"Since I read the first Alanna book and liked it a lot, I naturally expected this one to be just as good. It isn't. The plot is exciting, and the characters are engaging, but...ewww. Tamora Pierce seems to think that if you are three months into puberty and still not sleeping with someone, there is something wrong with you."
3,Well . . . it was okay . . .,"I thought this book was definitely not as good as the first one. The plot is just as intense, but the sex and kissing I could do without. But you should definitely read this if you're thirteen or older."
1,Total BS!,"This book was the biggest disappointment in my life! The cliches were beyond what I had imagined! And this is written for 9-12 year olds? I fear the sexual standards this sets for them. After all if Alanna was going to do it with someone, at least do it with someone who is sincerely serious about you. I'm not going to dis out Jon here, because words cannot describe this loathesome bastard. But GOD! Don't waste your time with this regurgitated, media inspired, crap. If you want a strong, realistic, female lead go read Yukito Kishiro's Battle Angel Alita. That is actually worth your money. It's real sad that a MAN knows how to make a better heroine, than one of my fellow women."
5,In the Hand of the Goddess Review,"This book is fantastic. It is funny and has romance, action, and is very descriptive. When I read this book, I felt like I was the main character. This book is also the second book in the series ""Song of the Lioness.""In this book the main character is Alanna. She is trying to continue to become a knight. In this book Alanna also fights the signs that she is becoming a woman. Will she be able to become a knight?"
5,IT IS THE BEST!,"i think Tamora Pierce really out did herself. Out of all the books shes written so far this has to be one of my favorites. Alanna is a wonderful hero. she is just discovering in this book how much fun it is to be a women, she also is becoming more of a hero."
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely love In the Hand of the Goddess! It's a fantastic book! Although some people dislike it because; Alanna slept with Jonathan, and and he tried to ""make out"" with her. Also George and Jonathan both kissed her. But who cares? Wake up people! I mean you had to see it coming. Come on! Alanna and Jonathan are teenagers,(hormones) and George is probably 22. And he is looking for a wife! Also people say this book is not for 9 year olds, but they should and do know about that stuff! So i say go out there and read this book,I strongly recommend it! so get yourself anice cool pitcher of lemonade, and a lawn chair, and settle down for a nice long read."
5,WONDERFUL!,I loved this book with all my heart. I enjoy reading books and I've been reading ever since I was five. I read this book all in one day. I love Alannna's free spirit and strong willed sense of body. I also enjoyed her love affair with Prince Jonathan and figuring out who Duke Roger really was. How the goddess appeared to her was so graphical and detailed that it felt that you were actually there. Especially how they described the way hte goddesss loked. I LOVED every part of this book. I would recommend this to anyone! I would also like to tell Tamora Pierce that she is a brillaint person with a good heart.
5,A fantastic tale of triumph and believing in yourself.,"After reading all four books in this particular series, In the Hand of the Goddess remains my favorite. Alanna, disguised as a boy, must keep her secret in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a knight. She is a girl's inspiration, believing in herself and never giving up. Her friendships with the clever prince and the charming theif make her adventures all the more interesting. This book is truly worth reading again and again."
5,The Power of a Goddess,"A world of mystery and adventure awaits in the sequel to Tamora Pierce's first book Alanna, The First Adventure. This sequel titled In the Hand of the Goddess has plenty of mystery and suspense to keep the reader interested and never bored. Alanna comes to learn that her feelings are changing towards the people she cares about, especially the prince Jonathan who found out that she was a girl. Tamora Pierce did an excellent job in creating this piece of literature. The first book was very exciting and the second book was just as adventurous. This book is great for anyone to read, and I believe it is one of the greatest books of all times."
2,"It was fine, not great, I expected better","I had been dying to read this book since I read Alanna, the first adventure. When I got it I found it more than a little disappointing. Alanna seemed to have had a major personality transplant.What happened to her anti-guy attitude? I mean I expected her to grow out of it but it would have been nice if she could have done it slowly. Instead she took this major age jump from 12 to 15.The plot was predictible and I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't grown to care about the characters."
3,Not Appropriate for 9-12. Move to Young Adult.,"While I enjoyed the story line of this book, I clearly found the relationship between Jon and Alanna inappropriate for 9-12 year olds. This book should not be listed in that area, but in young adults."
4,"Good characters, bad pacing","In the second book of the Song of the Lioness series Alanna has been able to maintain her masquerade as a boy to all but a few of her friends. Alanna is also now Prince Jonathan's squire. The book starts out with Alanna having a run in with a goddess who tells her she must face her fears; fighting Duke Roger and falling in love. As if that wasn't enough to fear, during the course of the book a war breaks out and Alanna must survive that as well.I liked this book about as much as the first one. The characters are enjoyable and the love triangle was quite enthralling as well. The plot is basically a good one but it loses a lot of it's effectiveness through the pacing. The book covers four years and every time I got comfortable with events that were occurring the book would skip ahead a year. Still, the book was an enjoyable quick read and fans of the first one will be pleased with it."
4,A great book for young adults,"This is a really good book, but I rated it with four stars because she does some bad things. It doesn't describe to much but a young child shouldn't read that part. Other wise the book is really good."
5,REMARKABLY WRITTEN!!!,"The second installment of Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness Quartet was every bit as promising as the first. In this book, Alanna is a squire and forced to face her fears including love, Duke Roger, and the Ordeal of Knighthood. The next four years of Alanna's life are portrayed in an exciting adventure including a war, her first romantic experience, more life threatening experiences, and new enemies.Although this book may be frowned upon as inappropriate to the younger audience, for young adults and teenagers, this should be an enthralling book that will captivate your imagination and sweep you into Alanna's world."
5,My favourite one...,"I have to admit that out of BOTH the Alanna and Keladry quartets, this is my favourite book of them all... well, it's pretty closely tied with the 4th book in this series.... This book is amazing. Even though I loved both Alanna and Keladry, Alanna was my favourite. She had a mix of everything.... including her romance with George, which was my favourite part of all. This book is just .. WONDERFUL! It'll make you laugh, scream, smile, and cry! I love it and I know you will too!!!"
5,Heorism with a Twist,"Welcome back to Tortall. Alanna is back with flare. Those who read the first book know that Alanna uses her mind, sword, and tounge as weapons. She is a quick witted now squire, in the Princes service. We meet a new frined in this book. And an old friends change (some for the better, some for the worst). The second of Mrs. Pierces Song of the Lioness series is a must read and the best out of all the series.*** If you like these books you would also like The Wind Singer by William Nicholson; The Fires of Windameir by neil Hancock; Wolf Tower by Tannith Lee; The Earthsea Cycle by ursula Le Guin; Shakespeares Stealer by Gary Blackwood; Witch Child by Celia Rees; The Prince in Waiting by John Christopher."
2,This young adult book is more on the adult side,"I brought home this series for my girls, because I read Alanna: the First Adventure and LOVED it. I know they would have loved it too but now I can't let them read it because this book is so inappropriate! All of the characters, including the heroine, have casual sex. I'd prefer NO sex in my YA novels, and certainly not sex after 3 kisses! I'm very sad to have such good books ruined in this way."
2,Getting worse . . .,"This book was pretty disappointing - the heroine was SO predictable with the way she acted. It's pointless! Nowadays, all the heroines are striving to be ""tough"", falling in love with everyone in sight, sleeping with them, and still unable to decide when a proposal comes along. This explains her attitude throughout the whole quartet, but I just wanted to say that here to warn readers: don't get your hopes up too high.The book itself is good, with a well-worked, exciting plot, but the heroine is just barely tolerable! I almost didn't want to read the rest of her books! Oh, well, I'll leave you people to make your own decisions about this book. Read it! (Even if Alanna is a stuck-up, bratty player!)"
3,"Story great, morals poor","In this third book of the series, Alana becomes Prince Jonathon's squire. It is a triumph for her, especially since he knows that she is a girl. However, they both leave the knightly moral standards behind as they become lovers. I was truly disappointed in this turn of events. It is too bad that Ms. Pierce let modern day morals slip into this wonderful series."
4,Alannna is the best -- according to my 12 dd,"This is the second book of the Song of the Lioness quartet by Tamora Pierce. I bought the series for my daughter- she enjoys the strong female character who works her way from being a page to being a knight. There are plenty of action packed adventures, quirky characters, and suspenseful subplot with evil wizard."
4,Got you back,"A first-person account of Canada's most (in)famous barhopping ...The road starts with a leap-year birth,and follows him on as the winner Canada's most beatiful feet', into a cocaine fueld populated by lesbian wives, lovers, and a particularly glamerous pig.Which leads all the way back to a barstool, back home in Canada.The 'Kids' now Scott Thompson, with the aid of show-writer Paul Bellini, ontroduce Charles Butterick Cole."
5,One of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.,"Cheers to Mr.Thompson for this extremely humerous look at gay life through the truly fabulous eyes of Mr. Buddy Cole. I laughed so hard I fell off the stairmaster at the gym (only read this book in public if you don't mind people edging away from you as you laugh out loud.) I was fortunate enough to hear Mr.Thompson at one of his last readings in San Francisco, and later have the book signed by him. I would hope the publishers at Dell Island Books give Scott the huge advancement on his next book he so richly deserves."
5,My favorite album of Blue System!,Obsession is Blue System's greatest album in my opinion! The music and lyrics are great! This is a must have album for all Blue System fans.
4,perfect for camping,"I don't like all the battery operated camping lights and such, and don't want a hundred hoses running from my grill gas tank to each light, camp stove, etc. I bought this and while camping, I don't have the ability to chill the small tanks (although it's no problem to put the grill tank in the sun). What I find is that the small tanks don't fill completely, but it doesn't matter because I can just refill them, and I have gas for 3 lanterns, a small side burner for my trailer, and a camp stove without having a bunch of hoses and such laying about. I always use them up for safety sake before transporting them home, but I really love using this item. It's saved me a ton of money in gas and even in batteries."
4,Simpler trick,"Put the large propane tank on it's side with the valve facing down, then you'll get a much better fill. Propane is a liquid at pressure so it flows with gravity. But when it's full, tilt it back up to normal and open the valve again for a second or so to make sure the canister doesn't over pressurize. Works faster this way, too."
4,Nice and Easy,Nice small unit.Quick and easy for filling.Found best result was to freeze (5 min) the 1 lbs bottle then fill.
3,Rusty,"Item was received promptly, however it was ""rusty"" . It appeared to be in the origional packaging. I'm hoping the rust on the threads does not affect the performance!"
3,LPG Disposable tank refill adapter,"The adapter is well made and works as per the instructions.I was a little disappointed because I thought I would get a near full refill of the 1-lb disposable bottle. However, that is not the case.In a pinch the product works well, and maybe that's all it is designed to do."
2,Causes my grill to freeze up,"EDITED REVIEW:This thing is currently being sold to refill propane cylinders - not so when I bought it. Then it was advertised to attach a cylinder to your grill. See discussion below. This review is for the use they sold it to me for, not whatever it is now.REVIEW:I think this thing needs an off valve. Every time I have tried it, the sudden pressure from the cylinder froze up my bbq. When it eventually thawed, it worked, but as a steak saver, it didn't serve the purpose, because that took 30-45 mins."
1,save your money,"I bought and used this thing. Not only is it dangerous to use (no shut off) It only fills a one lb bottle, maybe half way with a full 20# can. save your money"
3,Kinda works,It fills the bottle half way even following the directions. I still maybe doing somthing wrong but followed the directions and even did the recommended tips
5,Received the item and trid to use it but could not get it to work. I think they failed telling all that was needed to use this i,Find this item to be something I will use very often. I found this item when I was looking for something else. Great buy. Something else is needed to make this item work. It appears you have to have a device to open the ehaust port while trying to put LP gas in the bottle. Looks like a bicycle valve.
2,1 poundrefill adapter,It works but u cant put enough gas back in the bottle to last. feels like about 1/2 of what a regular tank has. Would not tell anyone to use it
4,USE WITH CAUTION,This is a brass fitting to enable a POL propane tank to couple with common 16 ounce bottles....you have to invert propane tank to release liquid propane into bottle. 'Decanting' propane is a process for well experienced RVrs/boat cruisers...extremely dangerous. A good tool to have but I cannot recommend it for safety reasons. Safer to buy propane bottles and drop the emties in the garbage.
4,Right connector.......why so pricey...?,"Even though amazon has the best price generally.......these little gems are priced a little too high from everybody.....some are downright robbery......come on...it's a simple valve.....Yes...We need it, but less than $10. would be reasonable. These are going anywhere from $14-30.+ What a gig! Have you checked current Amazon price on a 1 lb canister....$13......Wow! You have to be joking...get a new supplier!I digress........Is it ObamaCreep...??...""your utilities WILL necessarily increase""......I think that's one of the few thing he's said that was actually true.....even though it was a very sneeky way to present it(most use the context ""not necessarily"").....always twisting words.....corrupt lawyer/scholar/community organizer...now President! 2 terms and counting............Wow.......Anyway......great device......just too pricey for what it is!"
5,Walmar...loosin money,"3 dollars each or 2 for around 5.29 retail and I went thru like 10 in 3 days with my my Buddy Heater so this was well worth it. Usually get less than 5 hours out of my Buddy Heater on low. With the refills I get from 3hr50min. to 4hr15min. Not bad for the money your saving and paid for it already.(you can get 14# propane tanks for $15 at Walmar..)Just follow the directions on the insert. Large tank inside at room temperature, attach adapter, attach small cylinder. Now flip the large tank upside down and open valve. I found I was able to fill more by listening to it fill untill the noise stopped--which was around 90 seconds. Small tank prep--place in freezer and take out and fill one at a time. I was hunting so they were in the trunk outside in 25deg. weather. Don't do any of the other tricks out there; it's not worth your safety."
4,But be careful,The adapter works well with both the tall cyliders and the coleman style squat cylinders. Please read and comply with the instructions for use as the cylinder you are attempting to fill will become very cold. Do not expect a complete refill but the savings of 3/4 full over buying a new cylinder is worth the price of the adapter.
4,Read others reviews to know how to use it,Be safe when using this and don't try to over fill your tanks. I was tired of buying the small tanks and not knowing how to recycle them. This solved this problem.The reivews I read really helped out in terms of usage even more than the instructions. Pick a warm day to fill the tank and keep you large one inverted (pick up truck bed was best suggestion) and put your small green tanks in the freezer for 10min before filling.
3,Like it,"Still experimenting on how to get a more complete fill on my 1 pound bottles, but it does work and is very handy adapter."
4,Works great.,The product is very handy. The cost savings of buying bulk propane and still having the ability of keeping my lantern and other items portable is great.
2,It does the job. But it is a lot of work.,"I gave this thing 2 stars because it does work.I bought one of these several years ago. It does not matter who made the one that you have. These adapters are all the same. You take your 1 lb empty bottles and chill them in a refrigerator or freezer. Why? Because the propane will run down into a cold space from a warmer larger tank better. Attach this adapter to your 1 lb tank, then attach the other end to your larger tank. Then invert the whole thing and open the valve on the larger tank. The propane will run down into the smaller tank.Any air or gas inside your 1 lb tanks will be trapped there. There is no gas release on this system.I found the whole process to take more time and be more work then it was worth. I simply buy some 1 lb tanks at Walmart."
5,AWESOME,This adapter is easy to use and payed for itself with one 20lb tank. I found several tutorials online that were very helpful.
5,saving money,this has been so wonderfulreally easy to use sense receiving thisI have saved so much moneywell worth the price easy to install on tankb shore to read your directionsif you're a camper this is a must haveor if you has a big buddy heaterallows you to take your heater we are you need it most
2,dont waste your money,Only refilled tanks about half way and also caused some of them to leak. Its cheaper and more cost effective to just buy new bottles
4,Money-saver for campers,"Saves three dollars on each propane cylinder by refilling from 4 gallons (grill) cylinder. Works as expected, gas tight machined. need a wrench to hold while setting in the small cylinder. Buy if you go camping frequently."
4,Does what it does,"What can I say, except it does what it's supposed to do. I got this to refill cannisters for a Mr. Heater Little Buddy unit which, on a cold night, can eat 3 full cans of gas per night. Just screw on the spent can, open the valve on your tank, count 60 seconds, turn off the valve, unscrew the now mostly full can. Refills don't feel as heavy as new cans, so presumably are not complete refills. I can live with that.One point. EVERY 1 lb propane can I have seen has a prominent warning on it that says the can should NOT be refilled. And apparently there are federal laws against bringing refills on public transportaion. Proceed with caution."
5,Cardio Samba Workout,"WOW, what a workout! I can feel it in my bones and everywhere else. Worth it's money and I loved learning new dance routines while working out."
3,Pain Relieveer,"This product will relieve pain for several hours. It has a strong menthol smell, but the pain relief is worth dealing with the smell."
5,Cryoderm Works!,I've been telling everyone about this product which includes this morning. Would recommend to anyoe. I perfer the roll on because you can control where you want it vs. a spray which would allow too much to end up in places you don't need it.
4,"Good, but not a miracle cure.","After battling finger joint osteoarthritis for many years, I've reached the point where prescription drugs are hardly effective any longer. CryoDerm has proved to be the most effective of all topical remedies I've tried. Now, that is not to say it removes all discomfort. It does, however, give me some temporary relief. I'll continue use so long as it continues to be effective. A side benefit is that the strong menthol scent is a help when seasonal allergies cause sinus swelling and breathing difficulty."
2,Cat owners beware!,I gave this a 2 star only because something in the smell of it made my cat go absolutely crazy! I put the gel on my foot and wore my shoes; later in the day when the shoes were off and the cat caught whiff of them she went ballistic...like she had been given an over dose of catnip or mind altering drug!! She attacked and played with the shoes and then was ready to start at my feet. There must be some ingredient in it that stimulates the cat's brain. I had to give my 2 units to a friend who has no cats and he says that the product does provide relief so maybe my rating would have been higher had I been able to use it.
2,THE SPRAY ON VERSION DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS,"i BOUGHT THE ""SPRAY ON"" VERSION, IT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS. POSSIBLY THE ""ROLL ON"" VERSION WOULD BE A BETTER SELECTION. I HAVE USED THE ""ROLL ON"" VERSION AND WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED."
5,Love this stuff!!,I've used both the spray and roll-on. The roll-on is easier to get on your back. The spray works great for transferring into a small bottle when traveling.The effect lasts about 2-4 hours and allows me to sleep. Amazing the effect that menthol has on pain. I stay stocked up with cryoderm and have spread the word to friends and family. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than getting through your chiropractor.
4,Highest Rated Menthol Percentage,"I noticed in nearly all of the roll-on pain relievers the main ingredient is menthol. They all vary from usually 2%-5% but this one has the most I've seen of the ingredient at 10%. I think it works pretty well and you do not need to use a ton of it because the % is so much higher than others. Its one of the better cooling pain relievers out there in my opinion, and I have tried them all."
2,Round our bodies,"""Ext. night"" is a 60-minute album which consists of one track only, and there are no skip marks. As comparisons, Brian Eno's ""Discreet music"" and the extremely minimalist ""Neroli"" come to mind. The main body of ""Ext. night"" are soft, atmospheric synth sounds, overlaid by spare electric guitar textures which veer between growing more prominent and calming down again. That makes for relaxing, effortless listening, yet the music never gels into something distinctive and remains too static. Without any rhythmic accompaniment and fully developed melodies, ""Ext. night"" can only be considered as background music, but given that ambient music has made a great leap forward in the '90s - with bands like Autechre, Main, or Seefeel - that is a disappointment. Give this album a pass and start your Cunningham collection with ""Voiceworks"" or the noisy, experimental ""The yellow box"", featuring Anton Fier (from avant-garde outfit The Golden Palominos)."
4,Product works as stated,"This product didn't fix all of my back problems, but along with chiro visits, stretching, and an inversion table, it's contributed to my therapy regime.This roundness of this product has held up well for the several weeks that I've been using it. The firmness is also good for me, not too firm."
2,too soft,if you are buying this to put behind your back it may be fine. if you want one to roll on your back and legs it is completely useless. the carrying case is pretty cool if a soft pad is what you want.
2,Uncomfortable,"I purchased this product for my auto and office chair. The elastic strap is too loose/flimsy to hold the product in place. It rolls forward and places the user in an umcomfortable, and possibly physically dangerous, position."
4,very firm,This is the firm density and it really is firm. I probably might be happier with the medium density. Other that that it is good.
1,Very Poor Quality,"Used this support for less that 4 hours total and it had already started to unravel at the seams, obviously poor quality"
3,Premium Lumbar Support with Worthless Attachment System,"I bought this to help with my facet syndrome in my lumbar spine. When I can get it to stay in place, it's wonderful. Unfortunately, that involves manually placing it in the correct position after I sit in the chair, because the strap that attaches this to the chair is worthless. It's made of incredibly stretchy elastic, which means that it moves out of place as soon as minute pressure is applied. Even worse, the plastic buckle does not hold the strap in place at all. So every time I stand up, the support falls down onto the chair seat.Granted, I have a curvy-backed chair which is not ideal for this kind of attachment, but I think the strap was really under-designed, which is a shame."
3,Average but not awesome,"The product was bigger and firmer than the one I had used at my physical therapist's office; however, I am still glad I bought them."
2,Lumbar roll,The Lumbar roll is a good product however I ordered a firm one and it is way too hard. It's difficult to adjust the roll to your lumbar area because it's so hard.I would not order firm but the middle density.
5,Lumbar Roll,I left my lumbar roll pillow on the airplane and was so upset! I use it ALL the time.My husband had gotten it for me several years ago and I take it with me everywhere.I looked it up on Amazon and found it cheaper than on the McKenzie website.
4,Aint really a toy,"I thought this was better than the other one I bought because it was firm. The other one I got was soft so it was like a pillow. After my last one, I looked for one that keeps its shape well. This did the job"
4,Finally Found A Lumbar Support I Like!,"I get severe back pain from flying a helicopter and sitting at my computer chair. I tried many ""lumbar supports,"" but they all sucked. Even the Original Mckenzie Lumbar Roll was no good. But then I tried my luck with this particular one: the ""firm density"" really makes a difference, I've been back-pain free ever since! It's firm enough to actually support your lower back, the others I tried were worthless."
2,it doesn't work for me,It kept sliding down on the back of my office chair since the straps just get lose on its own. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
4,good lumbar pillow,"I have lower back pain and have just used regular pillows folded in half - this is much better than that! It feels good to feel the pressure on my lower back and I like the 'firm'. It is a bit too big to use in my car, but great for the couch or bed."
4,This is much better than standard firmness one!,"After a back surgery, I purchased both standard firmness and firm density to try them out. I've used them on my work chair and a couch at home. Standard firmness one gets flattened after using it for few minutes and no longer gives any support on lower back. Firmness density one stays its shape no matter how long I use it and gives a good support. I hope that both have better straps so they won't move. Overall, the firm density one gives a good support and helps my spine align properly."
4,McKenzie Lumbar Roll - Firm Density,"I like the style of the lumbar roll and find that it's incredibly easy to use on most chair types. I actually think that the density is more firm than I'd like, but I also don't use it every day all day so I haven't noticed a change in its firmness so far."
3,Ok but I would not say it is firm,"It stays up nicely attached to my car seat but I would not call it firm, so I am somewhat disappointed. Delivery was prompt, though."
3,Can't sit back in the chair!,"I read reviews that the standard firmness is not firm enough, and that the firm pillow is too firm, so I decided to try the firm support. It definitely needs getting used to...I've been sitting with it for a few days now, and I'm still having trouble fully sitting back in my chair. I've adjusted it to a number of different positions and although it offers support, it feels like I'm slouching in my chair because I can't sit all the way back without being really uncomfortable (for me, the pillow is a little too large. But I think this is a pretty standard size for a lumbar pillow). It does, however, offer support for slouchers. I tend to lean forward in my chair from time to time, and with the back support there it gives me a little extra to lean against."
4,Love Can Lead to Betrayal,"This is a wonderful book. It is about young Justin Stokes' relationship with Ursula Devane, anolder woman who is his mentor and guide. Their lives are inextricably connected until Justinends up betraying Ursula as Ursula had once betrayed her own mother.I am a fan of Gail Godwin's and highly recommend this book. Another book of hers that Ilike very much isViolet Clay: A Novel."
3,Good beginning and ending,I had a bit of trouble getting through the middle of the book: I lost interest but towards the end it picks up again.
2,As Boring as I Remember,"I am sure Lawrence Durrell received accolades for this book, I am just not sure why. It is so long and so slow that the entire time I am reading I am asking myself why I thought it would be different than when I tried to read it in high school. I admit, I did not finish reading it, so perhaps there is a great ending that ties it all up in a pretty package. But I am now 60 years old and my time is too important to waste it trying to find out."
3,alrxandria quartet,"new edition combining 4 books of Alexandria Quartet. Hoped for 4 individuals as this is heavy for travelling.In addition, too much margin on left side of pages causing the book to be too tightly bound; Therefore hard tohold book open."
1,Couldn't get into it,Tedious reading. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this style. Could be I'm just not into this anymore
2,This book cannot be recommended in our time!,"The Alexandria Quartet was a very popular book in the sixties. I read it when I was a teenager. After more than forty years I read it again and was disgusted by the snobbish English attitude of the author. I admire the writing technique but the way Durrell talks about ""Arabs"" when he refers to the Egyptians shows that he had no interest in the people of the country where he lived for so many years. The Arabs never have a name, nor a face. All characters in bis book are either Jewish or European (mostly English).For me this is not a good book today."
3,book condition,the book was in the condition described and I'm enjoying reading it. Knowing I can trust the description given of used material means I'll use that source again.
5,A Few Dollars More,Rxcellent purchase with ease and rapid shipping! The dvd was in great shape and a real additionto my collection. THANKS!
3,What happened to the sound-video synchronisation?,"Yes - I know it's dubbed, etc. But something bad has happened to this film's transfer to DVD. The speech is so far out of synchronisation from the video that it is almost unwatchable. I have a VHS version of this film and the problem does not exist there. I also have DVDs of 'Fistful of Dollars' & 'Good, Bad & The Ugly', they don't suffer from the same problem. Can MGM (or somebody) get this sorted out?"
1,Don't buy the MGM DVD version,"Why? So-so picture quality, but really let down by the sound - for long periods it's completely out of sync with the picture which for me really spoilt the viewing experience. A shame for what is an excellent movie. The transfers for the other Man with No Name films are much better."
5,Best of the spaghetti westerns.,"By far my favorite of the Italian films. If you've never seen a western or an Eastwood film, you should see this one. The direction and the acting make this film incredibly captivating and will make you want to see a lot more Clint Eastwood films."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:For a Few Dollars More could have used tighter pacing, especially in its draggy third act; it's a must-see for fans of Leone or Eastwood, but not a terribly accomplished film in its own right."
3,DOES THIS FILM HAVE EXTRA 'RESTORED' FOOTAGE?,"I REALLY like films with restored footage. The Good, The, Bad, and the Ugly had about 17 minutes or so. 'DAS BOOT' must hold some kind of record at over 60 minutes. Whan y'all get the new 2 disc DVD set, please add a review about how many minutes were put back in. NO point in buying it if there is no extra footage. THANKS!"
2,The Clint and Lee Show,"This is the only Sergio Leone film released in America worth your time, and the attraction has nothing to do with anything Leone put in it. The script is the same kind of brainless, illogical mishmash Sergio brewed all his swill from. It's Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef who salvage the whole thing. By the mid-60's these two had put in a decade and a half in the Hollywood studio system and bring every bit of that long experience to their scenes together. They have economy and humor that's great to watch, even in this tripe."
4,"Great movie, single disc DVD not as great","In my opinion, this is the best of the Eastwood-Leone westerns. No point in going over the content, as other reviewers have already done so. Unfortunately, the single disc DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so if you have a 16x9 set, the image won't fill the screen. There is a 2-disk British edition available from Amazon UK (or EBay)which is far better than this one: it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, the picture and sound have been restored and cleaned up, there's a commentary and some featurettes (and it gets 5 stars). If your DVD player can play Region 2 discs, THAT'S the version to have. We were supposed to get this in the USA in fall 2005, but after Sony bought the MGM film library, they dropped it from their fall releases and I've heard of no plans to release it, or ""Fistful of Dollars"" or ""Fistful of Dynamite,"" all of which received similar upgrades. Let's hope Sony changes their mind about that."
1,Warning about the DVD!,"The DVD's I bought and saw had a voice soundtrack that was horribly out of sync to the point of ruining the movie. I don't see that anyone else mentioned it, but both copies I've seen had the same defect."
3,Weak Link in the Leone-Eastwood Trilogy,"Though worth seeing, director Sergio Leone's ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) remains the least satisfying film in his Clint Eastwood trilogy. Despite superior production values and undeniable style, Leone's second Italian Western is too ambitious for its own good - resulting in an overlong, somewhat draggy narrative. Strangely enough, Eastwood's Man With No Name takes a back seat to Lee Van Cleef's veteran bounty hunter in this revenge saga. Memorable action sequences and Ennio Morricone's classic score help redeem the uneven tone. Leone benefited from the film's flaws when crafting his immediate follow-up, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966) - a fully realized masterwork with no dead spots."
3,my favorite spaghtti western,"that is one of my favorite movie , since i'm a baby boomer that reminds me of my youth....."
4,"Attention, Owners of the Laserdisc . . .","Just looked at the first 6 chapters of what I presume to be the June 2001 re-issue of the DVD and I'm pleased to report that a number of frames that were missing from the laserdisc version have been restored, namely where you see the bullet wound in Guy Callaway's forehead and where the sheriff tells Col. Mortimer, ""His name is ... Manco"" along with the cut to Manco walking into the town of White Rocks. Sound synchronization doesn't seem to be a problem as reportedly has been the case with the initial release of this DVD, though with a movie as heavily dubbed as this one is to begin with, it's hard to tell for sure. [Others have] mentioned some frames were missing from the scene where Manco and Mortimer are being beaten up by Indio's gang. I'm sorry to report that this is true; they don't even show where Indio suddenly stops laughing and orders his men to stop the beatings. They cut to where he tells his gang what he plans to do with Manco and Mortimer."
1,For a Few Dollars More,"Hands down this was the worst download of ALL TIME!!!! I have ben watching the no name movies for so long I don't notice the little things that some claim take away from the quality of this movie genre. I have never ever been picky about all those little things you hear the new digital generation complain about. However this movie is the worst I have ever seen after making the purchase and downloading it under the assumption it was viewable. By the time I spend/waste all the time trying to get my money back it would be an even bigger mistake than the download. From now on I preview ALL movies I am going to purchase no matter how many times I have seen them on VHS, dvd, etc. Word to the wise people"
4,Fun western with plenty of gunplay!,"A good sequel to Fist full of Dollars, a must see for all Clint fans"
1,Poorly written,"This book was included in the reading list for the Tapestry of Grace Year 1 homeschool curriculum, specifically the Ancient Egypt unit. Seeing that it was written by Tomie dePaola, I figured it would be a fantastic addition to our library.Am I the only one that finds this book to be incredibly terrible? It is poorly written, there is very little plot development and all of a sudden, there's a Bad Guy. The storyline seems scattered. Overall, I feel as though the story is just not written well, at all."
3,Fun but inaccurate,"As a grandmother I enjoyed reading the book to my grandchild until I came across the words ""weird looking"" to describe the sphinx. The sphinx is anything but ""weird."" I'm sure the author can think of a better description. Caught by surprise I used the word ""unusual"" and added that it has the face of a person but the paws of cat. Also the Bad Guy and the women in the car are dressed like Gulf Arabs. No Egyptian wears clothes like that. A good book marred by an author who didn't his homework. Young minds being impressionable, ""small"" things count."
3,Sizing,"I am not sure what ""easy fit"" means, but these shirts are smaller sizes than comparable sized shirts from competitors."
2,too small in the neck,"I ordered this shirt in a medium which is my normal size. The neck on the shirt was much too small for a medium shirt, and it felt like I was being gently choked. So if you really want this shirt, make sure to order it at least a size larger than you would normally."
4,Could be fun if it was more durable,"My boys couldn't wait to play this one. It is a lot of silly fun, but we've had to rig it a few times to get it to stay together.Cute idea and cute name - I paid under $5 - the price was right given the quality."
3,"Happy to find this album on a CD, but the quality isn't good","I was happy to find this album on a CD, but the sound quality isn't good. I don't know if it's because I have an old CD player, but the CD sounds like its '80s quality radio coming through a tunnel. My other CDs sound fine on the same CD player. That being said, it's still great listening to the new wave songs. Modern Talking rocks!"
5,S Video for old tv set,This is just what I needed for hooking up my PS3 to my old analogTV. Much better than the cable included with the PS3. Plus it freed the other hook-up for another component.
2,small picture book,"unlike field guides to, say, western reptiles or birds, this book contains almost no information on the guitars in the guide. basically it is a picture book of a few examples of a few models, with very little descriptive information or text to inform us of year by year changes or other forms of ""speciation"". it's not really much of a filed guide, it won't help you in the field. it's a pocket book of pretty pictures."
2,Guitar field guide,"Some nice pictures of some nice guitars but not very helpful in identification, significance, or value of vintage guitars. I will donate this book to the local library."
2,not very informative,"Not very happy with the information in this book. Tried to look up a Martin Guitar 021, there is 11 pages of Martin consisting of 9 guitars only. Eric Clapton auction guitars has 66 pages. Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. Tried to look up Les Paul custom, there are 2, a 1955 and a 1958."
4,A Good Little Book,I got decent service on a book in excellent condition at a great price. It's not a wealth of information for a serious person seeking a tool to help them purchase a vintage guitar. But a cheap little book with limited information and beautiful pictures of really nice guitars. And I dig guitars. What do you want for $2.00?
3,incomplete,"I could not find two guitars, and one old Univox amp that I have in this book..so I kinda wasted my money....."
4,Pocket-Sized Guitar & Amp Reference Book,"Pocket-sized mini-reference of the major guitar manufacturers. Also includes some amps.I was a little disappointed in this book. It has lots of color pictures of the most popular guitars (several of the same model in some instances) and price ranges. There is also a potted history of each manufacturer. However, there is little or no detail or description of each model.Easy reading, and good for somebody just discovering guitars who wants a cheap and quick visual reference to the most popular models."
2,Nothing New Here,"October marks Connie's 50th year as a recording artist and this is what they put out? Another hodge podge of hits that can be found on SO many compilations that have come out of the US. Universal should look to Japan or South Africa--now they have put out tributes befitting the biggest selling female singer of all time. This is a sad (but probably sells) and not very well made 50th Anniversary release. They used mono tracks when stereo were available. Connie Francis is an American, yet overseas she appears to be more respected. Pitiful. Shame on us!"
4,Great Vocals But Overdone,"I've been a Connie Francis fan since I was a teenager (a very long time ago) and think that she is a wonderful singer. This collection of songs proves that she is. She does a great job on each and every song. However, there's just too much included in this album. So many of the songs sound alike that their inclusion seems a bit redundant.All her megahits are there - 'Where the Boys Are', 'My Destiny', 'Vacation', 'Who's Sorry Now?', 'Stupid Cupid', and a favorite of mine, 'For Mama: La Mamma'. The album contains 44 more lesser known although very well performed songs.As mentioned in other reviews, special attention was given to the sound quality which is very good and most of the photos included are very good as well."
3,Could be a Rainy Saturday Watch,"The movies are ok. I love movies, these are good moral and thought provoking movies and are good for family viewing, could be good quality time spent with your family. CA_MN"
1,Questions TOTALLY NOT representative of the shelf exam!!,"The thing I hate about PreTest is that the Qbooks are not consistent...it's hit or miss: PreTest Emergency Med, PreTest FM = HIT, PreTest Psych, PreTest OBGYN, = MISS!! Questions are way to detailed and nit picky; I suppose such questions are good for residents, but definately not appropriate for a 3rd year medical student exam. Plus, there were way to many one line question stems...again, not representative of true Shelf questions. Lastly, there werent enough medicine questions....the Shelf is notorious for being rediculously biased towards IM...my shelf had way too many questions about post op fever, a topic which this book didnt address at all. Overall, very disappointed with this PreTest book. I recommend UWorld's OBGYN questions, or Lange Q&A."
2,Out of Date,This collection of articles was originally published in 1988 and was a good contribution in its day. But a number of books and academic papers have been published since then with the results of additional excavations and research. As a result some parts of this book have become significantly out of date. The newer books are more accurate and give a better understanding of these remarkable people.
5,The Phoenicians,"At last! A decent book on the sailors and traders supreme who were dispersed by Rome and written out of history by the Romans & Greeks.Long live the Phoenicians.For further reading see:[[ASIN:B008V0T8AO The Atlantean Irish: Ireland's Oriental & Maritime Heritage by Quinn, Bob published by Lilliput Pr Ltd Paperback]"
5,Another o.p. Gem,"This wonderful book was nominated ('shortlisted"") for England's Booker Prize, a major British literary award. Gabirel Harvey is the son of an elderly, emotionally tyrannical father, and a sprightly young mother. Oswald and Amy are mismatched.The live a scraping-by existence in Postwar Britain, (the novel ends in the early 1980s). until Oswald comes into a fortune.Instead of being delighted with the money, Amy chafes under Oswald's flowering pretensions. She leaves abrubtly just before Gabriel's thirteenth birthday.Gabirel descends into a proverbial decline, but through common sense and wit, collects a great deal of experience, while waiting to hear directly from his mother.Bailey's description of London and its characters is insighful and zesty. We lean about Oswald's secrets. He claims to be an honest man, but it is revelaed near the end that he is anything but honest. This book is a well balanced combination of humor and sadness."
3,"Stay to your own hardcore outfit, please.","From what I've seen Spin is supposed to be an alternative magazine, and I happen to like the Strokes, thanks very much. I haven't checked it out yet. Those of you who say you're metal fans, do you like alternative rock? If not, you shouldn't bawl out an alternative mag just because you like something else.I think it's rather mean. Try constructive critizism, instead of ""THIS MAG SUX TAKE IT BACK"" or whatnot. Try to be intelligent, and people may benefit from your reviews....I think I'll try this magazine just to defy you people.*This has been an angry lecture from a person with level views on being nice to other people so you don't start almighty rows with people you don't know. Thank you, and goodnight.*Beyond and to all time I stand,deFamine"
2,Spin doesn't spin,"Spin magazine has gotten a lot less cutting edge. It's all MTV-related jokes and burbly articles. At times they have a good article or picture orr whatever, but most of the time they rely on trends and flavors of the month,If you want good music magazines, try looking at Q or Mojo. Or if you want to stick with American music mags, check out the new Filter which is almost as good. They have everything Spin doesn't."
3,Decent overview,"Ok - This is not pitchforkmedia.com - the online music review who's more concerned with prose rather than the actual reviewing of music BUT nevertheless the greatest source out there to new music. This ain't Rolling Stone neither, who'd have a better place in the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame rather than the newstand, as it doesn't mean anything anymore to contemporary music fans. This is the guy stuck in the middle, between the one who does not want the intellectual crap of the one, neither the commercial junk from the other. Hence, a 3-star for ideal pulp, just what you want if you have 10 minutes to spend on the toilet! But then again, this is a daily occupation..."
3,The only magazine...,"that kisses The Strokes' ass more than The Rolling Stone.Please don't subscribe to this. I guess if you'd like a good magazine for your bathroom, go ahead and waste a $20 on it, but think about how many long distance minutes that $20 gives you? You could call a cool record store guy and ask HIM about what's cool to wear and to listen to, and that would cost you less than subscribing to any magazine like Spin.Now, The Spin Doctors were good.Their first album anyway.I never saw that movie, Spun, but I heard it was good.Have you heard U2's song ""Lady With The Spinning Head""? Good tune.""I'm spinning in infinity, Amen, Hallelujah"". I think that's how that lyric goes on Paul Simon's song, ""Call Me Al"".Oh wow. You know what I just realized? The word ""spin"" backwards is NIPS!Hell, this changes everything!Buy this frickin magazine immediately. Coolest magazine ever.Nips.HA!"
1,Gone are the days .....,"Gone are the days when you could expect Spin to serve up really good stories, reviews and photography that you could not find anywhere else. Now it merely goes through the motions and tries to act like it's really cool."
1,Spin Magazine,"Give me a break,people!All Spin Magazine is a cheap rip-off/wanna-be of Alternative Press.I've looked at like maybe ten OR less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years.Think I may've saved ONE of those issues.Sometimes,I'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that's been left behind.I'll then take it home,then likely toss it out after I've looked through it twice.Avoid at all costs!"
3,SPIN Good And SPIN Average,"The SPIN, ""Special Collectors' Issue"" THE 90 GREATEST ALBUMS OF THE '90s, is very well written. The list of albums is intresting and seemed well thought out. The writing is exceptionally good (see the review of one of my favorites; Buena Vista Social Club).Then I come to the 50 Greatest Bands and the list is pretty bad by anyones standard. So many ""glitz"" bands who were more glitz than music are in this list.So its very hard for me to decide if SPIN is good magazine that has slipped or just a few bad publications out of many good ones."
1,You're Out of Business After Stealing My Money,You're out of business & I am out the money I paid for a subscription. You send me 'Car & Driver' as a substitute. I don't own a car! How about sending me 'Rolling Stone' as a substitute?
2,Used to be good but new design is awful,I have been getting spin since it started. They recently changed formats and now it looks nice but lack substance. Instead of monthly it comes 6 times a year. I won't be resubscribing
3,Spin mag,"Its an OK magazine. They talk about music you've never heard of too much, so if thats what you like, then you'll love this mag...."
1,Time to line the bottom of the birdcage,"Between the fact that I never get the latest issue of this horrid magazine on time and the lack of decent artists and bands, Spin magazine represents everything wrong in music to me. For a magazine that claims to represent counter culture and the concept of alternative music, they certainly don't represent my musical horizons with the garbage they put on the cover of their magazines (Creed, Limp Bizkit, Matchbox Twenty). If that isn't enough, what the heck is all this... about video games, movies, and fashion layouts? If I wanted to read about those things, I would buy magazines that would be specifically tailored for those subjects. Rolling Stone magazine is far more entertaining than this... that Spins churns out on a monthly basis..."
2,Twenty minutes per issue,"I ordered SPIN for a year, but soon found that the amount of time I spend with a new issue is not much more than 20 minutes. I'm forty now, so I don't care who is supposed to be cool. Most of the bands are not that interesting to me, but that's not the point. It's the writing, mostly pretty stupid photographs and record reviews that don't excite me. In my opinion, a better magazine supposed to cover similar ground is ""Under the radar"". If you really care about music and want to read an informative magazine, try ""Mojo"". They cover a wide range of different styles and I spend usually several hours with a new issue. Of course, you won't get it for ten dollars a year!BTW, my SPIN subscription ran out several months ago and I keep receiving it for free. But do I care?"
5,Much easier to digest than an issue of rolling stone.,"And for my money a better deal, better magazine, better writing, beter everything.This or alternative press are the best AND most affordable music magazines that there are out there. (the only music magazine I'm a bigger fan of is cmj new music monthly which comes with a cd of new music every month..sadly it's not sold in stores anywhere anymore but i regress)Really there's not a whole lot else to say if you've never read this magazine you should probably check an issue out before subscribing but I don't see how anyone could hate it.If you are in love with rolling stone magazine than spin isn't for you because it's aimed at the common man, where as rs seems to be aimed at people who like over indulgent articles that ultimately don't entertain or enlighten people to anything new. If you like something that is good for a quick read here or there and to be on par with what is hot today spin will give you that and so much more.x"
2,better in it's earlier days,I Liked SPin at first but sometime around the mid 90's through now I got bored with them.they ahve a few things I dug such as there take&asking artists too name there favorite Artists ever type of things but over time they went with the flow&just are kinda there.I don't get alot of what they have become&while I like some older issues&articles I don't pay them Mag much attention when I go magazine&book reading.
4,"not much to say, all good","Buy a subscription to this mag every year for my sister on her birthday, she loves it, it comes on time, and I'm pretty sure she is entertained by it unless she's lying to me. I doubt she is though. I think maybe the only problem with this mag is that they feature crap mainstream bands sometimes, which I personally have no problem with since they're just trying to make a living too, but my sister the audiophile will make comments on from time to time. Please, it's like $10 bucks a year and I think this year they (amazon) even gave me half off on it so what's to lose? Nothing, that's what."
3,Some Good Some Bad,"This issue of SPIN, ""50 GREATEST BANDS"" was terrible. But SPIN also had best music from the 90's issue. This was very solid list. The writing was solid, the list seemed to be put togethor with a lot of thought. For example look at the mentioning of the ""Buena Vista Social Club"" album in the ""90's issue. The writing was excellent why this album was mentioned !!"
5,You Spin Me 'Round,"This magazine rocks.Not only does it give struggling, unheard of artists a genuine boost, it promotes honest and unflinching accounts of the lifestyle behind most of today's musicians (as well as yesterday's, now that I reflect). Beside accomplishing that, there is not ""definition"" to the type of music chosen. It isn't an alternative magazine. It's a MUSIC magazine. And that it has accomplished very well.By encompassing all genres (excepting country, I must admit) Spin has become one of the better music mags to have graced my mailbox. Spin is forward thinking, well-written, aesthetically pleasing and a gem of a monthly publication. There aren't stereotypes, typical photo shoots, boring stories or gimmicks. It is straightforward and real, and I am glad each month when my Spin arrives."
3,I guess I'm more of a Rolling Stone guy?,"I've had a sub to SPIN and RS for a couple months now, and I tend to pick up RS a lot more. SPIN gets a skim on arrival, and then sits around til I pitch it in the recycle bin. Call it personal preference, but I'm just compelled to spend any time with it.But don't take my word for it!Just pick up a copy--at pretty much any store--and skim through it. Buy it if you like it, put it back if you don't. (I'm assuming you don't know how shopping works, if you've never heard of SPIN and need a review.)"
2,Not good for ftp upload to site,"I bought this for an IP camera that could upload still images on a schedule to my ftp site. It has very few options in this category. I wanted to be able to upload one image every minute or less even. It can either do it continously or you can set up a schedule or times (to do it continously). On the FAQ there is an area that looks like there is some extra menus for doing a manual setup. Guess what? Those menus are not included in the actual firmware you get with this product. I upgraded to the latest firmware version, hoping it would be there, but this changed nothing in the options.If you just want a camera for network security to be monitored remotely or from inside your network, this will work, although its quality is NOT that good. Id recommend even the bottom of the line Axis cameras as their picture quality is much better.If you are looking for a camera with a good ftp upload client like I was go with Stardot. They are more costly but they are twice the camera."
2,Confused About Sampler Pack,"I ordered this sampler pack of instant soups and it was delivered very promptly. (arrived within 2 days)The confusing thing is that I'm not sure what I received in the package. I was expecting some instructions and/or information in English..... but everything on the packaging is in Japanese. Unfortunately I live in an area of Pennsylvania where there is no Japanese population.The package contained a total of 22 small packets in eight various sized strips .... two packs(4 strips), three packs(2 strips), and four pack (2 strips).I have no idea what is in the packets or how to prepare them. I assume that they are various kinds of instant soup.Do I combine them?Is each packet a complete soup mix?Does this represent 22 servings?Your guess is as good as mine. I am going to try to prepare the soup by adding boiling water to each packet. I'll update this review after I get a chance to experiment.It's like a Dining Adventure! Wish me luck!"
2,What?,"Another mix album? The ONLY reason I give this release two stars: Jones is a wonderful writer and composer. These tracks do not ""date"". I simply cannot believe that Jones cannot create new tunes. Sad."
2,Mixed feelings,"I checked this book out at my library to see if I liked it. This was a good idea, as it happens. At first glance it seemed good but upon further investigation, I was baffled by Moses' still lifes, which seem to hover in space with no visible means of support, and her flowers, which often have a spattery, abstract look. Her use of salt for textured snow is heavy handed and distracting.On the other hand, I applaud Moses' generous use of the last portion of her book as a showcase for her students and their work. And her friendly, encouraging style of writing would be helpful for beginning painters.I did like some of Moses' paintings. But the more experienced artist would be better served with Marilyn Simandle's ""Capturing Light in Watercolor"" for advice on creating strong compositions. And if you want to paint bricks and building elements, skip Moses' scanty two-page explanation of this subject and see Richard Taylor's excellent ""A Watercolorist's Guide to Painting Buildings."""
1,Not what I thought...,"I thought I was buying a full copy of the book, not readings and conversation of it. I did not read the fine print, shame on me, but it could have been made a little clearer what this was."
1,Thank you for your reviews,I thank all of you for telling me this is NOT the book. I agree with all of you. I want the book and it obviously is not available on the kindle. I too have waded through all the titles and cliff notes and am very disappointed that it seems to be unavailable.
1,waste of money,"I thouht that the audiobook was the actual book, but I fell for the hook, line and sinker.this is he worst $4.00 I have ever spent in my entire life... it is just a bunch of bull%#*~ book-clubbers that are talking about the book. I have a freakin book report to do and all amazon has is this!? wow. do not buy this unless you want to waste money and hear pta moms and old guts talk about their experiences with it."
1,Dont be fooled This is not the audiobook,This is not the audiobook but a speech about the book. If you are looking for the actual book DO NOT BUY THIS!! It is not as described
3,This is not the actual book,"I did not realise when I bought this recording that it was not the book. It has some nostalgia value, for those who want to hear how much others enjoyed the book, but it is not the book, as I said, and does not have study material, either. Three stars, for what it`s worth. I did not think that the recording quality was very good, and I thought that it was not translated from a meeting to a listing-only medium very well."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"I loved this book. I had to read it for school and could not put it down. Scout is just to epic. I thimk that this is a good story for kids andor adults. would be careful with kids cause it dose have some strong subjects. This is a book about the 1930's in the small town of Maycomb,Alabama. the story I think behind it is how much family means and that we are all equal. The characters all grow in some way thought the story. wether it is they learn what it means to be a lady or how to play football or even to not be so uptight. this is a very good read and i hope if u read it you will enjoy it as much as I did."
2,still a hard book to read,"I purchased this book after purchasing the 2nd edition for my graduate course on translations. If the 2nd edition was bad, this one is slightly better, but it is still a hard book to put into practice. Half of the stuff discussed in this book is not used by professional translators, and it is targeted towards students whose 1st language is English, not Spanish. So for a person like me, taking a Spanish course in translation, the book doesn't work. Unfortunately I don't know if there's a book written in Spanish about this topic, so that's what the professor assigned. (and he's from Spain... go figure!) The student will learn quite a bit of new terms related to the translation business, but that's about it. As a person who has worked on translation for the past five years, I have to say that less than half of what is discussed here is not used in the business. Bottom line: I can't wait to sell this book once the semester is over."
5,GREAT BOOK,"My students are LOVING IT!!!! Well written, tools & exercises, LOTS to talk about! Excellent sources for further reading, quotes and references!"
5,Great western!,This is a great western movie. It's one of my favorites. A definite must-have for fans of western movies!
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A clever updating of Yojimbo, ""Fistful"" sometimes reveals its low-budget origins but is certainly worth a look for anyone who enjoys westerns."
4,First Important Spaghetti...,"No more Rawhide for Clint Eastwood,as the stranger rides on to Italy to meet a legendary director by the name of Sergio Leone to make this classic western that started a trilogy and a genre like no other, loaded with the distinctive richocet sound of bullets,the sun blazed deserts of the Madrid,the rolling hills of landscape and the ever lasting bold scenery. These were hardened men from a way of life growing up in the old west,where survival was a reliable .44 - where violence was just an ordinary daily routine, and the women were mainly the Ladies of the night of local saloons. The music,the unique music scores in these spaghetti's always seem to fit in with each scene,giving it that western feel ,kind of like,""ghost riders in the sky"",although some scores should have been shot,and there's always the ""go for the gold"" plot,just remember ""A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS"",started it all."
3,"""The mule doesn't get it""","""~Before I had seen this film, I always thought that Clint Eastwood played tough-guys that frown all the time. But, after seeing this film, one can appreciate and understand the fact that he is a talented actor.""~ suspenseful and the camerawork in every scene is nearly flawless. Leone brilliantly shows near desolation in the near-ghost town in the middle of nowhere."
2,shoddy job,"The two stars are for the poor quality of the DVD not the film of course, which is one of the quintessential speggetti-Westerns, fascinating and great fun. This DVD is of very low quality both visually and in sound.I don't have the VHS to compare it to, but I remember it well, and don't believe it was any worse than this DVD version.One can always hope that someday a truly worthy presentation of this classic western will be made available."
2,Didn't remember how bad it was,"Hadn't seen this for years and I had forgotten how bad it was. Of course Clint looks pretty good (he was so young then)! But it's really pedantic and slow for today. (Sorry, Clint!)"
3,Does not use the full screen of my TV,"One of my favorite movies, but it does not take advantage of my widescreen TV. The picture only uses about half of the available screen."
5,Yo! Jimbo!,"The opening credit montage heralds something new and exciting. A majestic Ennio Morricone score played over silhouettes of cowboys and the sound of gunshots. What follows doesn't fail to disappointment. Director Sergio Leone reimagines the West with a flavor unknown in these parts. Star Clint Eastwood,at the time wallowing on TV's ""Rawhide"", presents a new archetype with his drifter whose motives are unknown. He wanders into a lawless Mexican town playing two warring crime families against each other. His intentions aren't so much altruistic rather it involves a profit motive. This film is unlike anything that came before it and influenced generations to come. Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill-Volume 2"" is one example of Leone's influence. So what if Leone cribbed Kurasawa's story. In this case imitation is the best form of flattery. Both Leone and Sam Peckinpah reinvigorated a genre that may have been on it's death bed."
1,He Called It Macaroni,"Clint Eastwood was a far better actor during his ""Rawhide"" days, but in 1967 the director Sergio Leone poured him into a zombie mold and Clint hasn't quite broken out of it since. This is a western for semi-literates who can't connect with real people or the world around them and so prefer to inhabit a place like Leone Land. Nobody you know lives there, just a race of moronic stereotypes; there's the constant scream of ersatz opera in your ears from the crazy soundtrack; and the director rubs your nose in endless closeups of his repellant cast and dares you to find some plot in their aimless comings and goings. To his credit, Eastwood fulfilled his three picture deal with Leone and never worked with him again. Anybody with a taste for good films will quickly see why the actor was sick of the clam sauce."
4,First of the Spagetti Westerns.,"This movie although it drag at times is all in all a decent movie. I can't see why it's out of print. This is Classic Westerns at their best. Look for the big guy with the rifle cartridges on the bandelero, every other seen there rearranged. A fairly good story and a must for Western fans."
4,"Western Clone of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo""","Watch Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo,"" released in 1961--three years prior to ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" and you will see striking similarities between the two films. There were enough to make me realize that the latter was spawned directly from the former.Leone does a fine job, but I think Kurosawa, the rightful cinematic originator of the mercenary ""man with no name,"" does even better, perhaps much better. The added starkness and keener editing of ""Yojimbo"" (shot in black-and-white) gives it another leg up, too, I think."
4,Timeless Western Classic!,"I had been waiting a long time for this to finally be released and in DVD format I was not disappointed. Picture quality was excellent. Sound quality was ok but I wish it would have been made in Dolby Surround 5.1 channel. It was in Dolby Mono. Still, this is a great film. A classic action western.Clint is the best in these films,and his Dirty Harry movies. It's what made him a superstar. And with DVD technology, it's like as if this was a new movie. Simply amazing! If you love Westerns and Clint Eastwood, then this is a must buy for the collection."
1,I'm a big Clint fan ...,"but did not like this movie at all. I just don't get the hype. I hate to say it, I mean it, it bothers to write this, but I think the entire movie and all that went into its making is very disappointing."
4,Tough guy's first film,"Clint Eastwood stars in his first movie and it was a pretty good movie to start out with. I like some of the 60's spaghetti westerns and this one I really like. Not the greatest special feautures but that's okay. The only bad part about this movie is that their is not a whole lot of action but other than that, great film. God bless you and God bless America."
1,"Unreason, or faith, is the threat.","When I started reading ""Iran, the coming crisis"", I thought I was going to read an informative, current affairs book on the crisis with Iran.Mark Hitchock is blind sided by his belief that the Bible holds the Thruth. His story of the second coming,and the rapture being ""an event that,from our human perspective,could occur at any moment"" acctually made me laugh.We are even provided with God's Blueprint for the End of Times (with a time line!) But, this is serious matter. Mr Hitchock's book is a sad case of unreasonable,almost fanatical thinking.He has written a staggering Christian lunacy.The problems we are facing in the Middle East are too serious . American should get informed. This book belongs in the trash bin.Pascale Luse."
1,Betting on Destruction,"So a pastor from Oklahoma is going to tell us the future of the Middle East. And, not surprisingly, it's all war and flames. Odd, how these people love to dream of fire and destruction. But what's really odd is that they've been peddling the same story of the coming end of the world for two thousand years. And they've been wrong consistently for two thousand years. What sort of madness can keep people like Mark Hitchcock betting on the end of the world when their predecessors have lost that bet ninety generations in a row?Perhaps it's the fact that ninety generations of preachers have grown rich on that losing bet."
5,Just as described,"The product is just as described, high quality, and was shipped quickly. I received my order in only a few days."
1,"Horrible book, horrible company",This company has a new revenue stream where they falsely accuse their customers of damaging their cars. They charge the deductable to the customers credit card and the reat to the customer's insurance. I would use another rental car company if I were you.
1,Public Relations Propaganda,"If Enterprise really cares about customer service, why have their customers created one of the largest and most vocal customer service complaint web sites with tens of thousands of discussion board posts about how horrible their customer service is?See the site at Failing Enterprise (dot) com.This book is purely public relations propaganda designed to whitewash over their myriad problems."
3,"Good Book, but not applicable to everyone.","This is a great book if your desire is to learn about Enterprise and it's history. However, I don't see it as a guide to other businesses as the majority of it's pages are Enterprise specific. Furthermore, it speaks of how ""wonderful"" a company Enterprise is with grand opportunities for it's employees, however, after having personally speaking with a former Enterprise employee I learned that the opportunities that were once there don't exist quite at the same level as when the company was younger. At any rate, the Enterprise story is a very interesting and impressive one. If you want to read about how this company went from having one Missouri location with just one employee to having 6000 locations worldwide and 70,000+ employees in just 55 short years then this book is a must read. Well written."
2,Too Much Company Propaganda,"Although there is some good information in this book, it is hidden behind a gushing view of the one company used as an example, Enterprise. It is obviously just a book about Enterprise, but without any hint of objectivity. The title should have been ""Enterprise: An Almost Perfect Company"". If I had known that prior to reading it, I would have had a much different expectation.A few other annoying habits in this book include:1. End every section with a list of ideas just presented in the chapter.2. Always remind the reader how great Enterprise is.3. Pound it into our brains....18. Make sure every list is a really, really long list."
1,A waste of time,"This is one of those magazines for teenyboppers obsessed with make-ups (aka ""beauty""), clothes, and celebrities. It is full of ads, models, and useless quizzes. Only few, few, few articles are worth reading. I encourage you to steer away from this horrible mainstream magazine. A precaution for parents: This magazine is FOR teenage girls having sex.Girls who start reading this from the age of, say, 12, are guaranteed to be: a)shallow, b)ignorant, c)obsessed with things that only matter in their own little world, d)oblivious to real problems in the real world, e)wearing low-cut jeans showing their thongs and tattoos right above their butt, and f)saying oh my god and like, like, a lot."
4,The Lost Issue,"Your magazine is one of the best types of magazines that a teenage girl can read. In the year 1947 my grandmother had written an arcticle for your magazine titled ""Oh,That Boy."" By Bella Weissbrot. I was wondering if you had that issue from 1947 in one of your existing files and could possibly give me a copy of that issue. Although I am not exactaly sure about what the issue was titled. (...)"
2,teens do what they do,"i think that seventeen magazine gives teenage girls a better understanding of what we have and might go through in our teenage years. i think it shows girls a way to deal with life in a better perspective way. i afiliate with this magazine because it is fun to read and is also a better way to asociate with other people and many people would like to talk to others without fighting, yelling,each other"
5,Great gift subscription for a young teen!,"I read Seventeen Magazine back in the olden days, and it's still a good magazine today. It's got great advice on fashion, make-up, getting along in school socially and academically -- it's all here!I purchased this for a family member just starting out in high school, and I know that she will love it as much as we did back then!"
2,Portrays Typical Society View of Teenage Girls,"For over three years I have been a subscriber to YM, Cosmo Girl, Seventeen, and now the new Elle Girl and I have to say between all of them Seventeen is the worst. The magizine seems to only focus on how to make young women look prettier, dress better, or get a boyfriend. It does not give you the feeling that you are already great and beautiful or does it give good advice to girls. I would not recomend this magizine to any teenager. If you are searching for a good teen magizine I suggest one of the other three above, they are much better."
5,Not just ANY teen mag!,"There are so many magazines that focus on either celebrities or fashion or makeup. I'm glad to find one that has all of them! Moreover, I love the fact that they not only recommend expensive stuff like many fashion mags do, they also have so nice and affordable stuff as well. I'd say it's the best mag I've read, ever!"
4,GREAT TEEN MAGAZINE!,"Purchased this for my daughter who loves this magazine. I just recently became aware Amazon carried magazine subscriptions at reduced prices. At two years, it's a great deal. Arrived the following month, thanks!"
3,Overlaps current subscription,The magazine is fine. The subscription is a renewal for my daughter and there was no way to show this on the order form. The first issue has arrived duplicating the second to last issue from the prvious subscription. I have contacted seventeen and hope the will resolve this. I will update when I know.
2,A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD READER,"I USE TO LIKE SEVENTEEN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DONT LIKE IT ANYMORE IT'S OK IF YOUR MORE INTO FASHION THAN READING REAL LIFE STORIES I PERSONALLY PREFER YM,TEEN PEOPLE,COSMO GIRL.IF YOU LIKE SEVENTEEN YOU SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO TEEN VOGUE IT'S ALL ABOUT FASHION AND MODELS."
2,Getting too old...,"As another reviewer said, it's more for kids aged 12-15 or 16. I'm now 18 years old and am just finishing up a 2 year subscription to Seventeen. It's got too many ads, pointless quizzes, and their sex advice columns aren't really what I'm looking for anymore.I have switched over to Marie Claire and I love it! It's totally made for the 18-20somethings crowd. It's an amazing magazine that is worth the $$$. Check it out sometime. You won't be disappointed!"
5,The best Magazine ever,"I've gotten hooked on this magazine the minute I started to read it. It has a lot of great tips for girls, and style advice. Although some people think that this is just another 12-13 year old's magazine, it's not. It's for all ages. Even older people (not trying to be rude;) )!!! Lost's of the stuff about style, they try to make it for girls who can't afford that 200 dollar pair of designer jeans, or that 150 dollar top. They have just as good as priced stuff (and looks way better) than those totally outragiously expensive stores that nobody can really afford. I love the magazine, it's for everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY."
2,Seventeen is more for preteens...,"I think Seventeen has changed a lot since I started subscribing to it 3 years ago. There used to be a stronger focus on fashion and beauty, but now there's a lot of quizzes and articles that aren't very helpful. Now that I'm almost 18, it doesn't have the same kind of appeal for me anymore. Despite the magazine title, I think it's become more geared toward younger teenagers, ages 12-16. I wouldn't recommend Seventeen to someone over 16. If you're under 15 or 16, it's still a great magazine to read and you should definitely try it."
2,Ok Maybe I am just 15 going on 21..,"I am only 15, which is a targeted age group to ""seventeen"" but it lost it's appeal when I was 12! It's so young and immature, but the ironic thing is that I, too, am young and immature. I just got new interests, eclectic tastse, and my own sense of ""style"".But if you are still stuck on having to be ""in"", listen to what's ""in"" and wear what's ""in"", then seventeen is for you. It's all about the ""in"" thing in today's teen girl society. Quite frankly, I am not up for reading about those poser punks like gc and avril (who doesn't know who the clash is!) all the ""twinkies"" (steryotypical teen girls) listen to and I'm not up for reading articles and what new pair of blue denim flares are in for the season.Have denim flares even changed since I last read seventeen- no!! Hence.......Seventeen is a redundant magazine that you'll enjoy before you've really gotten a sense of self."
2,NOT FOR ME,"I thought I might like this magazine better than cosmo because it wouldn't have so much about sex in it, but this magazine is starting to contain more sexual content. I've never been much for fashion and make-up either. I just don't like girly magazines!Update: My subscription expired 1/1/11 according to Amazon, yet I am still receiving the magazine. I am not on auto-renewal (Amazon specifically says 1-year and that it is expired as of 1/1/11) and I never sent in any of the renewal forms the magazine sent me, so as of now I am getting free magazines. They better not stick me with a bill later!"
3,Have to edit,"After seeing that her 15 yr old cousins read this (and even some of her 12-13 yr old friends!), my daughter and I had a lot of discussions over whether I would allow her to start getting this magazine or not. We looked into other magazines that I thought were more appropriate (seem to be a lot for 8-12 yr old girls but not too many for 12-17 yr old girls) for a 12 yr old. Finally I agreed to let her get this magazine only on the condition that I see it first and edit out the inappropriate articles, etc. I don't need my 12 yr old learning how to ""hook up"" etc."
4,nOt sHaLLoW,"i have been subscribed to Seventeen Mag. for 2 years now.. and i do agree that some issues are a little... small.. but i also think that a lot of the articles are inspirational, and have real meaning. The other stuff like the quizes, and the fashion stuffs are just additives. i personally love them.. because they help me know what to look for when i go shopping.. so if you are a girl that likes real meaning in her life while still <at least tryinG> to look GREAT.. this is the magazine for U!!"
5,Great gift for teenagers.,I bought this magazine last Christmas when a special deal came across my e-mail and bought it for my daughter and niece as one of their presents and they were thrilled with it. I have since renewed my daughter's magazine because she reads it cover to cover when it comes in. I'm glad I decided to try it for them because they both seemed to really enjoy it.
4,Took a few weeks to get first copy and no gift card,"Took over a month to get the first copy, I had ordered a gift card but niece never got it...I wondered why she didn't thank my for the birthday gift.She just got her first copy, so all is good"
5,great magazine prices,This was a great deal on Seventeen magazine best price I could find for a 2 year subscription when Amazon has their sale on magazines.
4,Simply Irresistible,"Seventeen, the magazine that you can read UNTIL you are seventeen! In it you can read everything from witch animal is the softest to the sexiest dude alive!!! i would chose it over ANYTHING!"
3,Seventeen is not what it used to be.,"Seventeen used to be my favorite magazine. Unlike most teen magazines who featured only pop stars like N'Sync and Britney Spears, Seventeen focused more on fashion and beauty and contained a lot of useful and interesting articles. However, ever since the editors gave the magazine a complete new look, I have felt that it is not as sophisticated as it used to be. There are too many graphics and the whole magazine looks cluttered. And the articles are nowhere near what they used to be. I would recommend CosmoGirl instead."
4,Seventeen Magazine,This was a gift for my teen granddaughters.....don't know if they have received it yet or if they like it.
3,Read it for a few years.,"I started reading this when I was about 12, and I stopped when I was about 15. So, Seventeen would not be an accurate title for this magazine. I'm 17 now and I read JANE and NYLON. I guess for the average teenager it's okay, but I just got rather bored with it. It's the same thing over and over again, really. I suppose I just read magazines that are slightly above my age group. I would recommend it to young teens, though, then graduate to JANE or something. Jane is a good stepping stone."
2,Skip this one!!,"I started reading this magazine around 12 years old - then it was pretty interesting to me and appropiate for my age. Now that I am seventeen - the age that the magazine is supposed to be for- I have completely lost interest. This magazine paints teenage girls as materialistic, self-absorbed, and boy crazy. YES, we can be that, but for most of us, there is a lot more going on. If you've got more on your mind then whether ""boys like you?"" and what color glitter to wear this season I recommend SELF magazine. It deals with everything that is important to a young woman (including beauty stuff). If you don't believe me check it out at the market!"
3,Skinny and tan are not bad combos,"hi. ive been subscribed to your magazine since i was thirteen or so and im now 18. i like the magazine very much, along with the ideas you put into it. just one thing that upsets me not only with this magazine, but others also. now all the magazines talk about are people who are large or average are good looking. you think just because tiny/skinny people have high self esteem and that they dont mind hearing this? well its gotten to a point to where skinny people are ugly now which isnt true. most the models are skinny and beautiful. i think all sizes are pretty and i love being thin. most americans have gotten to the point where just because theyre large and over eat then that is what looks better and ladies and gentleman its not any better than seeing a skinny person. also you put in the magazine to lather up in sun screen and dont get in the sun, etc. etc. then stop having bronze babes and britney spears on the cover of the magazine."
1,"Hey, why not just order a free abrocombie catalog!","This magazine really blows. There are virtually zero interesting articles. Want stars? If you dont like who is on the cover you are out of luck, because there is nothing else. Want boys? None. But its a teen magazine. hmmm... I usually just like looking at these magazine for light, fun reading...but there is really nothing. But hey! If you want perfect skin, turn to page five where there is an ad for loreal. wow thanks. a catalog of ugly clothes and one article about jessica simpson, which they even manage to make boring. and *gasp* see the NEWEST fall fashion! Oh my gosh! boha girl is in! and then 50 pages of ads. Please, seventeen is the most hyped up and worst magazine i have ever subscribed to. it is not 'mature'and i really dont get why ANYONE likes it. just save yourself money and order a free abrocrobie catalog or something."
1,Vapid and Shallow,"This magazine is for the stereotypical teenage girl whose only concerns are makeup, boys, and (of course!) celebrities. The Lizzie Mcguire girl whose mind has never considered any ideas more significant than this season's newest shade of lip gloss or the cutest guy in math class. This is the written equivelant of cotton candy: fluffy, weightless, and cavity-provoking. Only with Seventeen, the cavity is in your brain, not your teeth."
2,Decent,"This magazine used to have nothing but ads. Well, they have cut down some of the ads and the meaningful articles. Every once in a while I come across a reall good interview, such as the one on Alicia Keys, and Ashanti however, this mag doesn't offer much more. There are plenty of quizzes and such. Overall a decent magazine for the preteens."
1,My daughter likes this mag when it comes,"Order and got for 4 or 5 issues. Then my daughter tried to sign up for a contest, missed where it was signing her up for a year subscription (for double the price) we canceled the unwanted subscription, but that seems to have canceled the valid one.Interestingly they never sent the promised new one or old one, but got tons of email and physical bills.Would not recommend."
1,DELIVERY DATE DISASTER!!!,"I was informed that I would receive this subscription between the dates of Dec. 21-Dec.24, which was perfect, because I had planned it as a surprise Christmas gift for my niece. Unfortunately, and obviously, the item has not arrived to her address as of yet, and Christmas has come and gone. Economically, times are difficult for me. So, this is the only gift I purchased for her, and she felt awful when there was no gift from me. However, I felt much more awful than she did! After logging into my account, I have come to see that the delivery date of this package has been changed to Jan 6th! I am irate about this, because I never even received a notice of this change! I learn from my mistakes. So, obviously, I will never order another magazine subscription via amazon.com."
2,WILL LOVE IT WHEN IT CO MES,I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS SUB TO BEGIN. I KNOW MY TEENAGER WILL JUST LOVE THIS MAGAZINE.
3,"maybe ok for 17 and up, but not for young teens","Much of the content is inappropriate for young and mid teens. Just look at the cover stories - this month has one on ""hot abs"" and ""the perfect kiss"". Not terrible, but not really appropriate for the younger teens who often read it. Too much emphasis on fashion, make-up, and materialism."
5,AWESOME!!,"This is a great magazine! It not only shows cute outfits, but where to find them cheap! It also has great inspiring stories!"
2,Delays,"This is the third time that I have to write a review about this product. I am NOT receiving my magazine and I don't know whatelse to do, I made a 2 years subscription and I can't spend all that time sending reviews or mails."
5,Great magazine for a young teen,"If your looking for a magazine for your young teenager, Seventeen Magazine is great! I never let my young teen read any magazine before I look through it thoroughly. Other magazines just don't seem age appropriate. It has everything in it a girl could want, such as fashion, stories written by other teens, contest and much more."
4,Seventeen Magazine Subscription,"I have to say I rather buy seventeen on newsstands. The reason for this being:1.Never Comes2.Comes damaged with pages missing3.Better pages if you buy on newsstandsI know it may be cheaper subscribing, but i have to say it's alot better to pay $3 an issue than to risk all of the reason's i listed above."
2,Not What I Expected,"I'm a 11 year old girl and this isn't good. I just like the pictures. Rather buy cosmogirl,teen people,popstar,j-14,and m. There's 2 much ads!!!!"
1,dont get me started.....,I really dont like this magazine but im 15 and absoloutly hate it. ok there is a few good parts about it......*it tells you wat look is in and wats not.*the beauty section is pretty good*tramarama is OKand its got bad parts......*the health is not ok*the celeb section is not really good*too many ads*the horscopes are awfulsoo i really dont care if you subscribe to it but its ok for ages 14-19.but if you want to obsess over you looks buy it.
1,pure garbage,I have two teenage girls in my house and I was so shocked by thecontent that I forbade it. we are religious people and we don'tlive total immoral lives like the girls who read this.don't let your kids look at it.
5,Perfect for teenagers.,"In my opinion, Seventeen is the best magazine for teen girls. I've been reading it on-and-off for four years now, but only recently began to read it again. It's not some childish, boy obsessed, teenybopper magazine. There are some great, monthly articles, like ""When I Was 17,"" ""Solve My Problem,"" ""My Life,"" ""Traumarama"" and of course, horoscopes, entertainment, fashion, beauty and more. The true-life stories they feature are really interesting, also. They recently did an intriguing article about emotional abuse.A couple years ago, I would've said that Cosmo Girl was the best magazine for teenagers. Unfortunately, it's gone downhill and has little substance left. If you want an interesting, fun and informative teen magazine, look no further than Seventeen. After all, it's been out for nearly sixty years. They're clearly doing something right!"
1,Seventeen,"During the month of October, I purchased this on line thru Amazon. It was a fantastic deal; however, my daughter has only received two issues. We went to the website of Seventeen and they gave us and extra month. Still, no issue. Went back to web sight and they gave us another extra month. Who cares???? She sees the issues at Walgreens and wants them ,but nothing via mail. They could give us 5 years free, but we never recieve the issue, so what good does it do.Frustrated Mom"
4,Another Mag,"After one year my daughter asked me not to renew it. She was not too thrilled with the articles, but commented on too many ads."
4,What Happend?,"Seventeen used to be great. Stuff about make up and evrything like that. It used to be really thick a lotta content. Now all Seventeen talks about is college and more college. It's still an okay magazine. It mentions good clothes and make up and has good interviews, but it used to be better. There isn't a lot of real life stories. I used to like it better. It's too short with everything now. There's not a lot about make up and fashion and mostly about college. But it's an okay magazine."
1,my opinion,"Seventeen (is bad)! I once borowed an issue my friend had and then finaly went out and bought an issue myself. The articles were exactly the same. NOTHING new. This magazine repeats itself over and over and over again. Even when they do put something new in (rarely), it is someting so obvious!They write about the same lame boy bands and the worst interviews I have ever read! I don't recomend you get it."
1,Not funny - 3 months to get my first magazine?,"Not happy with this order. They told me that the first magazine will arrive (4 to 6 weeks) it has been 7 weeks. Now I look at my order and it said that the magazine will arrive in March ( 13 weeks), maybe.You should be ashame for lying to your customers.I will not buy anymore from Amazon.""Amazon - shame to you for lying""."
3,eh.. :/,"when i first saw this mag, i wanted it.. looked so pretty, cool info and stuff.. and now that i have it.. it's EH. not as exciting anymore, esp since you only get it once a month haha.. and it's make up/fashion/hair ideas don't really work...oh, and for the $5 promotion thing,, i don't think it works.. i never got mine -____-"
5,Great,I ordered this for my sister for her birthday and she loved it. She received all the magazines and I am happy that she received them since we dont live together but they were sent to her house.
2,Not the Price I Thought,"I thought I would get the lowest price available (and maybe I did) when it was time to renew, but I it seemed high. Its still a good deal but I paid $5 for the year to begin with and I got emails of $5 subscriptions on magazines before it was time for mine to renew. So I figured it would renew for around that price so I didn't think twice about it. That was until I saw my bank statement and it was more then twice the price I originally paid. I will cancel after this year and renew it myself when I see a deal I like."
4,I like Seventeen,"Honestly, I'm 19 and I still read seventeen. I've read it since I was 15 and it's always been the same. I like the freebies and coupons, I laugh at the traumaramas, read my horoscope and roll my eyes at their flirting advice. It's all good fun. I have to admit their new-er sections, the freshman 15 and the beauty smarties are nice. I hope to one day join both. The Freshman 15 give real advice about college and that's cool and the beauty smarties are okay. It's the same basic, overrated chicks you see on YT, but every now and then you see a chick with some actual makeup skill that knows what she's doing and makes you want to try it. Other than that, most the tips are pretty lame and obvious and the celebrity sections are boring with the same lame celebs. Luckilu, Seventeen isn't that expensive. Mine was $5 for a year. My next subscription was free, so I continue to read it."
2,Suprised,I thought I was a mature 17 year old when I was that age. Wow how times have changed. Maybe a better name for the magazine is 44 because some of my questions were answered there. Parents make sure you review it first.
2,Wrong!,"This is a plain CD, no surround, not even a SACD!Choral singing is, well, ""American oldfashioned"", not something I'll play again..."
5,One of my favorite Perl books.,"This is one of my favorite Perl books. It really serves what it says it will. It covers a great amount of Perl coding, but like the title says, goes into a lot of networking code, functions and so on. For Perl network programming, you really should have and use this book."
1,one star,Well too bad about the music. I think she should start a new profession and music is not one of them.
4,Popular Mechanics,Popular Mechanics is still trying to please everyone with their content and is doing a good job. I'm glad that I started subscription again.
2,No Kindle Edition??,"Great magazine but NO Kindle Edition? Is this the 80's or is this the 21st century? I've emailed the editor of Popular Mechanics asking why they are not yet available as a Kindle subscription, but not even a reply.Come on Amazon & Popular Mechanics, you're missing out on millions of potential subscribers. We are kindle users and WE DON'T want to support paper based products anymore. Bring Popular Mechanics to Kindle."
3,Just full of ads,"I didn't really read it carefully, basically because I couldn't tell which are not ads."
4,Popular Mechanics,Enjoyed by the young men in our school library.I do take out the sexual explicit ads.
4,good magazine-late,"Interesting magazine, haven't recieved the first copy of the renewel yet. Ordered a year ago and had to wait over 6 weeks as well."
4,EXCELLENT MAGAZINE,Very good articles on a wide variety of subjects and new products. My 18 year old son especially enjoys reading about the futuristic items being worked on and written about. I think the articles stimulate his creativity and gives him some new ideas to think about. I also enjoy it because they have some pretty amazing articles about all types of things.
3,Good price,Six dollars is a good price but five dollars would be better.It seems if you wait long enough you can get the low prices.Popular Mechanics is still a good magazine. I like the how to pojects.
5,Great magazine,This magazine provides entertainment and education. My future mechanical engineer loves the ideas and has set about to construct some of the items he learned about from the magazine. What is better than inspiration to do something constructive?
4,Help,I now have 2 sets of the magazine coming to my home. I informed the publisher than I had renewed with you. Please advise.
5,Popular Mechanics magazine subscription,"I've renewed several subscriptions and they have consistently been recorded within three weeks by the appropriate magazine company. Intend to do more over the holidays. This mag is a good fit for the DIY'er or those interested in auto technology, home improvement, and more."
5,Popular Mechanics,I delight in the great price for a magazine I have enjoyed over many years beginning by sharing my father's paper issues.
1,Where is it?,I have not received a single issue as of yet. Ordered on 8/17/12. Why does it take so long in this age of technology?
2,Too many adds,"It took me 25 seconds to list through first 1/4 of the magazine to find anything to read. A lot of adds. I guess that;s why the price is low. However, not too many articles in the first issue a I received. Bit disappointing."
2,TOO MANY ADDS,SOME ARTICLES ARE GOOD BUT TOO MANY ADVERTISMENTS.I ONLY BOUGHT BECAUSE PRICE FOR TWO YEARS IS CHEAP.I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BOOK BEFORE AND DIDN'T RENEW BECAUSE OF ADDS.
5,Popular Mecanics,"Received Early... Good Service... I'm in for the long haul. Amazon is great, that's why I keep buying from them."
1,Absolutely the worst.,"PM is pathetic propaganda garbage, the type of anti-intellectualism that you see on the basic cable TV. Worst or all has been their propaganda about 9/11, which treats the reader like a complete idiot, claiming that huge steel-frame buildings fall down because of small, oxygen-starved fires while trotting out sell-out ""experts"" whom they shamelessly misquote. More at 911truth dot tk."
2,Too many hand gun ads for me...,"I received a subscription for Christmas last year as it seemed like a pretty broad based magazine with lots of good articles on a variety of topics. And that is absolutely true - however, I ultimately cancelled due to the number of advertisements for hand guns. Call me what you will (and yes, I'm from that bastion of liberalism, Massachusetts) but I could not support a periodical that advertises these items. Just my own personal feelings on this matter."
1,In the mail,The magazines were ok but I only received 3 of them.Total waste of time contacting Hearst Publishing they don't haveextra copies to send if you didn't get it.
5,great read,I received Popular Mechanichs when I was a teenager. I am glad to once again read from its pages. I find the contents thought provoking and always interesting.
3,Lots of adds,This magazine has changed a lot over the last few years. They have really cut back on the number of articles and projects per issue and the amount of adds in the magazine is out of control. I picked up the subscription on sale for 5 bucks a year though so I can't complain too much. Its still a fun magazine if you can pick it up cheap.
3,Popular Mechanics Hard Copy Review,"I very much enjoy Popular Mechanics. I've been subscribing to the magazine for almost a decade. Recently, I paid for digital copies of Popular Science and am a huge fan of the digital magazine. Popular Mechanics was one of the first magazines to transition to digital subscriptions and I wish I had switched earlier. I love the magazine and encourage everyone to subscribe, but would recommend they chose to purchase a digital copy. The digital magazine is very interactive and it's delivered directly to you regardless of your location. I rated this magazine as a 3 out of 5 because it's a hard copy. The content of the magazine is a 5 out of 5. I can't, in good conscious, rate any hard copy magazine a 5 out of 5 after trying a digital version of Popular Science."
5,Full of Useful info,Popular Mechanics is the true man's magazine. It includes all kinds of topics that real men are interested in. If you like gadgets and real men topics....not about moisturizers and glowing skin....then this is the mag for you.
1,false amazon promise,I ordered Pop Mechanics for a 1 year subscription for $7 new order or renewel. Was charged $12. Sent email to Amazon and they did not honor promotion. CANCELED SUBSCRIPTION! I'LL NEVER ORDER MAGAZINES FROM AMAZON.
1,"Great magazine, poor service from seller","I decided to try to take advantage of this subscription service from Hearst last xmas as a gift for my father, i knew it would take about 4 months before the first issue would be delivered, but to date i have only received that first issue.It's September, i made my order in December, and i have only 1 magazine that i got from you guys.If you cannot facilitate an order from a PAYING subscriber then why bother to offer the service in the first place?"
2,where is the magazine?,This was a gift for my Dad. He has only received one magazinewe I ordered it in Nov. and that one took longer because your order people didn't get his name right. If any one cares please take a look at the name on the order. He needs the full name an number.Maybe put the number on the next line. So far pretty poor service.
1,where is it?,bought a subscription on 12/14. nothing here on 1/20. hope it comes or get my money back.
5,best magizine ever,This is the best magazine ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gives lots of detail and has awsome articals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Popular Mechanics,"Since I haven't received the magazine yet, it is very difficult to review it at this time. However, I can review the 6-8 week delivery time as a minus 5!"
1,Not the best,"I confused this with Popular Science. This magazine is not very good. It has VERY few articles and TONS of ads. Many of the articles are bad or uninteresting. Some are even just plain wrong or they don't know what they are talking about. I will NOT be resubscribing, even if it was free."
3,"Full of ads, but where else are you going to get your fix?","I have to admit I get excited when I open my mailbox to find the latest issue of Popular Mechanics has arrived. This month (Sep 2011 issue) I felt like I was drowning in ads. Curious, I checked and found of 150 pages there were 59 pages of ads, and 17 pages of those annoying ""advertorial"" things that pretend to be magazine articles when they are just really huge ads. Added up, half of the magaine is advertising. I find myself wishing for a little more content... a little more elaboration on some of the topics covered. If there were a good alternative to this magazine, my PM subscription would be ending in a heartbeat."
5,I've been reading PM for over 55 years ... and it's still an excellent read!,"When I was a little guy my bedtime reading included Winny the Pooh, The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Brave New World, and four ""How-To"" magazines including Popular Mechanics. Three of the magazines changed direction (and/or failed) over the years, but Popular Mechanics stayed true to its Do-It-Yourself-type readers and is still worth reading cover-to-cover.No I'm not interested in selling my Popular Mechanics collection; I'm still using them."
3,Not the magazine it was 20 years ago.,Thin. Changed a lot since I was a kid. Low price but not much substance to the publication anymore. It is still fun to read and has some interesting articles.
4,Very interesting reading for those who like to know how things work,"I really enjoyed this magazine, there are some very interesting articles and I found something interesting to read in each issue. If you enjoy seeing how things work or what the latest gizmos are you'll like this magazine."
2,Waste of Money,"Picked up the September 2010 issue at an Airport Newstand and was disappointed.The cover story, Radical Vehicles, was both dated and pointless. 100 MPG is an embarrasingly low target for the X-Prize in 2010 when the Aptera, a ""car"" featured in this article, was announced with 150 MPG potential in early 2008. The 2008 announcement was more in-depth than this article.The backyard inventions article featured a spokeless bicycle from Yale. The article described nothing of consequence regarding the bicycle which would be interesting if there was on single benifit of a spokeless bicycle.Generally, the articles in the magazine seemed to be trivial and rarely even skimmed the surface of any issue of discussion."
3,"So So, not Great a bit thin","This might be a good magazine to get your Jr. High son or grandson. It has lots of interesting articles. I really enjoyed it as a kid.It takes a hard slant to the right on ocasion. There are also just a few too many times where what is featured in their tech review articles happen to be featured prominantly in the magazine's ads. Its hard to tell the ads from the articles at times. Its also just not that well written. The articles themselves are a bit thin.One article a while back mentioned a ""bridge of glass"" being built in Tacoma. (this was a follow-on to an earlier article on bridge technology and exotic materials) If you go there, its a bridge to a glass museum, but is made of ordinary reinforced concrete. A little editorial fact checking never hurts."
1,Someone messed up!,"This PM subscription was described by Amazon as being either a new subscription, or a continuation of an existing subscription.In the past, PM has always just added 12 months to my current subscription. This time however, a new subscription was started with the same name and address.As yet I've had no response from PM apart from an automated acknowledgment (no 800 number any more so all contact is either by email or post), so I've currently no idea whether it was Amazon or PM that messed up.If my subscription gets extended as it should then great, if not then it was a total waste of money.The magazine itself is fine, although the content assumes the reader to be a lot dumber when compared to issues from twenty years ago (more pics, less text, and an apparent assumption that the reader has a lower IQ).Should the subscription issue be resolved I'll amend my rating accordingly."
2,"Popular Mechanics is a magazine for ""low brows.""","I was impelled to subscribe to Popular Mechanics because of its low price--3 years for $15. I just received the first issue and even at less than 50 cents a copy, the magazine is far from being a good value. The articles are nearly all superficial. The longer ones, which strive to be informative, are aimed at teen-age or younger readers. Even the ads are crumby. I am always interested in reviews of new automobiles. The cars PM picked were all exotic vehicles, none of which I would ever consider buying. From my standpoint, PM is a dull, poorly edited magazine! I remember it from years ago whe it was filled with useful information. No longer."
4,Popular Science,"I have always enjoyed popular science, popular mechancis, popular electronics magazines. The only thing I don't like about these magazines is they keep adding more pages of advertisement. But I guess at only $15.99 for a 2 year subscription I can't complain. Keep producing informative information. Thank You"
2,"No substantial content, too many ads, political","PM would be a whole lot better with fewer adds, deeper articles and less political slant. In my opinion there is a severe lack substance, depth and are in general poorly organized. Articles are diluted and peppered with ads right in the middle of the text...organization is atrocious. As an adult, you'd think you'd be able to push through it and get it read. Then I realized I shouldn't be doing this. You'll start reading an article of great interest and you just fade out in frustration. Also, the magazine has a political agenda that is disheartening when the focus is and should be DIY and product education. It's just not worth it anymore, so I cancelled my subscription and will have to find something else. Sorry PM!"
2,too much ads and too little useful information,"i have to say that i was disappointed when i received the first issue. it had too many ads, and the information it provided does not seem first-hand. i subscribed the magzine by hoping to get some information on the new trend of technoloogy. it did provide some new trend, like 2013 car. But for me, it was too ""recent"" and not useful information since i am not planning to change my car."
4,PopSci Mag.,Always have enjoyed this type of magazine. I find it interesting and not overly priced. Good buy in my book.
3,"Good Magazine, but the first issue I received was not quite what was expected.","This was the first issue I received. The magazine had changed since I remember, back in the 1960's and 70's. The magazine back then was packed with, ""how to do's"", and projects that the magazine had ""simplified"", so anyone could do. I built aTesla coil using the ""blueprint"" found in Popular Mechanics. And there were other projects. I have subscribed to the magazine for 2 years, so I hope to find some interesting projects in future issues Theissue I received contained alot of information, and was like ones found in Popular Science. There were a few projects, like ""replacing a halfshaft"", and ""mounting a tv on your wall"", ""installing cameras to monitor your home"", but they didn't seem very thorough and clear. As I said: this was the first issue I received, so will keep an open mind and see the next issues"
2,Completely Rediculous!,Completely rediculous that I place an order for this item in November and estimated ship date is the end of February. I will not buy a magazine from these people again. I bought this as a Christmas gift. I can understand maybe a few weeks after Christmas but 2 months is out of hand
1,Never received issue,Ordered on January and still waiting on my first issue. I submitted two requests to have this looked into and have not heard from anyone. Don't bother in subscribing.
4,Good balance of science and technology,PM really interests me with it's mechanical science perspective. I should have subscribed sooner!
4,Bargain-priced entertainment,"Never having read PM in the past, I was hesitant to make a 2 year commitment, but the great price convinced me. Now that I've received a few issues, I'm sold. Great mag!"
5,Great Mag.,There is great info in these mag's I read them from cover to cover. There issomething of interest for everyone and you can't price.
4,Great Gift,Finding a great gift is a challenge. Having a son that has a passion for technology and how things work made this a great gift. The first issue was immediately read cover-to-cover... that says it all!!
5,Popular Mechanics - much better than Popular Science,"I have subscribed to Popular Mechanics for years now. PM has articles on the latest science and technology, as well as do it yourself project stuff, from woodworking to engines. It's geared toward those who actually work with their minds and hands, not just armchair mechanics or technology buffs - although they would like it too. I finally dropped my subscription to Popular Science. Popular Mechanics has it all."
2,I couldn't tell advertisements from columns!,"I went through only one issue and canceled my subscription. advertisements advertisements advertisements, and some short useless columns. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Never shipped,2 months have passed since I ordered this and not one issue has been delivered to me.I did however get a subscription renewal request from Hearst Publications.That will never happen.My 1 star rating is for the seller and not the magazine.
1,where is it,this is a great magazine. but after 2 issues came on the same day 6 weeks ago ; I haven't received another. This is a problem I've had with other subscriptions I've bought on Amazon
1,2 months- still waiting for my order,"There's nothing wrong with Popular Mechanics, but the company that handles the subscriptions is apparently completely incompetent. The original estimate for shipping was within one month of ordering, i.e. middle of December. After placing the order that estimate got pushed back to early January. It's now the middle of January and I have sent 2 emails to that company and still have not received a single issue. Buyer beware."
1,Still waiting,"Ordered this mag over 7 weeks ago and still havent received anything. However it didnt take them long to cash my payment, maybe a week. I'l never do this again."
5,Love it,For every man a must have. Read this once and you'll know why. It's a grown man's boy scout manual and tech guide. Give this to your future engineer and they will appreciate. Not trying to be sexist; I know there are some brilliant women amoung us also. This is definitly a techies must have magazine. I always wait at the mailbox same time every month for this one.
5,Great Magazine!!!,Taught me a lot about the what's going on in the world.Have read many times.Would highly recommend to others.Wish it had more photos and less advertising
4,good magazine,Only paid $5 for 1 year. The magazine has interesting articles for the whole family and little ads. Very glad with this purchase.
1,Too much too soon!,"I ordered a six month trial version and the very next month they made me renew for the additional year. A bit too pushy for me, I will not do this again!"
2,Wrong Recipient,I ordered this magazine as a gift and entered the address to which gift was to be sent. The first issue arrived at MY address....I contacted the magazine and hope to goodness the error has been corrected. I've had no correspondence telling if it has or hasn't I doubt I'll order magazines thru Amazon again.
2,"Could be more practical, Room for improvement","Jay Leno's column is cool but it is in every other issue, not monthly. I agree that PM gives a good overview of tech stuff and its great to have the advice columns for us home and auto owners. I find, though, the mag is too technical at times- it echoes the all too common tendency of many companies to focus on features and not on ease of use or simplicity of the product. Tech for its own sake, in other words. They often write about ""fantasy inventions""- things that would not work in the real world, e.g an underwater house- how would you deal w/barnacles? They also make a big deal over ""patriotic"" events which seem too bureacratic to be in this mag. I don't buy this mag to read about a festival honoring veterans, even though I appreciate vets."
4,Great Magazine,"I'm about halfway through my first issue and loving it. PM has a very nice mix of futuristic tech and current, more practical tech. I can't wait for the next one."
5,Great Gift!!,"This magazine was a gift to a family member, who isn't free for the moment, butthankfully soon will be. This was a great gift because, he loves this sort of magazine, because he is in to mechanics. This book also gives him hope of all the things that he has sadly missed for the last few years and soon will be able to do again."
4,Fun and easy read,I recently purchased a two year subscription on sale. The price was very competative. I saw some other reviews expressing concern that their issue took an extensive amount of time to arrive but mine came right on time for the next issue after the purchase. My boyfriend read through the whole thing in one day and has been doing further technology research on the internet. Made a great and economical gift. Seems good for someone who likes to tinker with mechanics and gadetry.
3,popular mechanics,"Its hard to review something you havent received yet. I dont know when it will come in the mail. I am looking forward to it coming, but until I get it, I cant give an opinion."
1,did not re order,Did not re order this magazine. Do not want to order it without notification as to if I want it again or not.Had ordered it for someone in prison and this person no longer wants it but I have to pay for it????
2,Popular Mechanics,It was not enough & interesting as new ideas in Mechanics.I couldn't find what is a news around the world & US for now.
3,Pop Mechanics on Kindle,Popular Mechanics is my favorite magazine. When will it be available on the Kindle DX?
1,below average mag,"not sure who this magazine is intended for but I found the stuff in it to be comparable to the incompetent blog posts I see everywhere.not only most the magazine is filled with ads but it's hard to distinguish which pages are ads and which pages are editorials.the last one I got had 7 steps to wash your car... so if you want to learn about that sort of thing, this magazine is for you."
4,Pop Mech,"Very informative magazine. Many articles, very helpful info. Nice to have. Ads for useful products, like the Exotec key system."
3,"Ads, ads, more ads","And all about increasing your manhood. I am a woman. I don't need a manhood increase. If you can get past the junk and offensive ads, the articles are good reads. The digital version is not included. So, you can save this for bath time or lunch reading."
5,Surprised,"For many years had a subscription to P.M., but discontinued when the content was no longer of interest to me. When I checked on Amazon to see if there were any magazines that I could be interested in. Surprised when I saw that P.M. was available for $ 5.00 a years subscription. I decided to try a year at that price. When I received the first issue of my subscription, I was surprised to see that the content has modernized since the last time I saw an issue of P.M.Although I would like to continue for many years reading P.M., a price increase will not be acceptable to me.The service of Amazon was excellent, as usual.UPDATE: The April 2012 edition has an article about science fiction writers etc. I recommend it to all s.f. fans."
4,A fine page turner/worth a look,"I have to totally disagree with Mr. Breck's review of 'MR HATE'.As an avid reader (at least two novels per month) of suspense and horror, I found Mr. Vinson's novel to be a finely tuned thriller with exciting plot twists and three dimensional characters I truly identified with and cared about! Yes, the violence is extreme and the gore equally so, but the subject matter involved doesn't exactly scream PG-13. Mr. Vinson's writing style is unique. He mixes humor and pathos equally well, and I found his use of dialogue very realistic.Anyone who is a fan of 'Silence of The Lambs' type novels will enjoy every twist and turn of this fine mystery.And, unlike Mr. Breck, I found Mr. Vinson's references to 'Andy Griffith' very appropriate within the dialogue between the sheriff and his deputy. Then again, I'm a big AG fan.Again, if you're a fan of early Stephen King or perhaps Thomas Harris, you can't go wrong with 'MR. Hate'...."
2,"Big on pictures, low on info","I bought this as part of my research into what fish to have next and found that even though I'd only had a tank for 3 weeks, most of what it said I had already found out for myself. The disappointment was that there were not more fish in the book to choose from as this is supposed to be a guide to help you choose your fish and there seem to be only the beginner fish - I suppose I was looking for a fish encyclopedia as I was trying to set up my fish purchase plan for the longer term, but to be honest, many of them seem to have more on tank set up than fish."
1,Where's Donald McKay's illustrations?,"MacKinlay Kantor's ""Gettysburg"" has been the finest introduction to the battle of Gettysburg written for young people for almost 50 years. Unfortunaley, this paperback reprint only includes Kantor's prose. The outstanding pen and ink illustrations from the original Landmark edition by artist Donald McKay are not included. I give Kantor's writting 5 stars. But the current publisher's inability or unwillingness to secure the rights to McKay's illustrations earns a big fat 1 star."
5,Landmark books,"My 10 year old grandson just loves these historical books. The boys in his class all asked him where he got them - I guess they are hard to find - and he told them ""Amazon.com"" A lot of good educational facts in these Landmark books."
1,"The Battle of Gettysburg tension, excitement... boring!!!","When I think of the Civil War I think of excitement and danger. I expect to read a good rich book about it. Yet this book squeezes all the fun out of thesubject War. Yes, war is nothing fun yet it may be exciting and detailed. This book totally lacks all this information. Yet it does tell of the blood thirsty belligerent Generals that are awaiting battle. I have a love of books, all throughout my life. I have read many too. I highly don't recommend this book for pleasure reading. Unless you want to get details for an essay, forget about it."
1,This book was terrible!,This book was so bad I'm not going to give it any stars at all! I have never read a worse book in my life! It is about war and exitement but the author... took that all out of it!
2,Nokia 3595 Wall Chargers,The pin jack is too small a size to charge our Nokia cellphones. I need the jack pin diameter 9/64 inches. The model of Nokia phone is a 3595 model. These two travel charger will not charge of phones
3,Good service-not sure whether it's the right product,"I got the charger, however, it doesn't charge my phone, so the seller quickly send me a replacement that still doesn't charge my phone, so I am not sure the charger doesn't fit my phone or my phone is broken. The service is good and quick. You just need to make sure this is the charger fitting into your model of cell phone before you buy."
2,Bad construction material. It tears off soon,"The shoe sole was great, but the surface material was too flimsy and tore off a different places within a few days. This shoes is not for regular work-out, but only for casual wear."
5,rolling head prybar,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It has a slimmer head that will fit in places an ordinary ""lady slipper"" won't. I use it for pulling tractor-trailer wheel seals and cam gears, and it has never let me down."
3,"Nice design, but stains easily","I bought this watch for my girlfriend and she was very happy with the unique look and the unique way it displays time. while the watch draws a lot of compliments and interest, the soft rubbery material used for the strap can stain when you wear certain types of clothing. Her watch became stained with a bluish color, and it refuses to be washed out. it continues to function perfectly but as the aesthetic is the major draw of this watch, the staining really took away some of its value."
2,Doesn't work....,"When you place it on your bed where it dips, it seems to inflate it just on that spot so instead of rolling into the dip, now you roll away from the hill. LOL. For us, it seemed to be really hard to get to the ""perfect"" inflation where it is level with the bed."
2,Good idea but lumpy,"Bought queen sized mattress remedy to fix a dip I have in the center of my bed. Pumped it up to make the mattress as even as possible, but it just made my bed lumpy. I could feel the 'remedy' underneath the mattress.Probably ok in a pinch especially if you have a huge dip and aren't that sensitive or use a topper. I was trying to fix a 1.5"" or so dip and don't have a topper.The thing smells terrible, if anyone is sensitive to smells. Really strong vinyl/rubber/chemical type smell. Not too bad under the mattress but I was eager to get it out of my room, which I try to keep as chemical-free as possible.Returned it and using a makeshift mattress for now."
4,"Pump broke on first pump, product works well","My 10+ y.o. full mattress has been sagging for some time, I mostly sleep alone. I placed a 2"" memory form topper to lessen the sag, which works but the dip is still there if you look really carefully. This Mattress Remedy really helps to eliminate the sag, restore firmness and even create a lil' lump via over-inflation. I figure that this acts as a lumbar support for my back if I sleep in the middle of the bed and so far it works. But the pump came apart upon 1st pump. It still works and crazy glue will fix that but you can imagine how bad quality that pump is. Before you throw away your sagging mattress, please do the planet a favor and give this a try, you may be surprised at how $40 can solve a $400 problem!"
3,Good idea,"I bought this hoping to wait a while before getting a new mattress. It does bring up the sunken area of the mattress, but it does so in a lumpy fashion. The middle bubble really comes up and I found this to be uncomfortable. I have tried moving the bubble towards the head and foot of the bed and raising and deflating, but it never feels right. Maybe if the shape were more of a large oval. Anyways for the price it's worth a shot. My husband seems to think it works fine."
1,Mattress Remedy review,"I purchased the full queen Mattress Remedy. Did not have much luck with it on full mattress. After inflation (minimal) the heavier person goes down, and the lighter person goes up. Probably need one for each person, or each side of bed."
5,Contour works well,"Bought this thinking it might could work -I have a king size bed, so it recommends putting two (one for each side), but because I was the only one in the bed, the sag was in the middle, so I only use the one, in the middle -It takes very little air -I had it pumped too high the first two nights -This will definitely help to adjust the sag and is a good solution to not having to buy a new one!"
2,Let Down Feeling,"I purchased two of these. They are fine while they work, but in a couple of months they developed leaks and wouldn't hold air, so were worthless.Save your money.---------J. Lehman"
2,Could Not Use,"My back began to give me problems after sleeping on our old mattress. We bought this in an effort to firm up our aging mattress, as it looked new and figured it still had a few good years left in it. The Mattress Remedy arrived quickly, and I followed the instructions, getting it placed and inflated. I inflated while my wife was on the mattress, so she could tell how firm it was getting. Got it to where she was comfortable, and after I got on it, it kinda moved around. We keep feeling like we where going to roll off the bed. If we let some air out to solve that problem, then it was not comfortable anymore. We tried different amounts of air, but could not find that comfort spot we where hoping for. After three nights of trying, I had to return for a refund. I guess maybe it would work under the right circumstances, but we gave up. Gave in and bought a new memory foam mattress(from Amazon.com also) and got the best sleep I've ever had. Would not recommend this product!!"
1,mt. Rushmore,Tried this product for our queen size bed. When we pumped it up it raised so much in the middle (even with a small amount of air) that it looked like Mr. Rushmore. When we laid on the bed we rolled to the edges and laughed so hard that we could hardly get out! It made my lower back worse(we bought this in hopes that it would add support to the lower back which it does not!). The pump came apart before we could even get it pumped up. This product is good for a chuckle but not for a good night's sleep. Not worth the money. Will be sending it back.
3,Not too bad...,"I bought the king version because it comes with two of the exact thing as in the queen. Now, this did get rid of the sag in the mattress, but it put a lump in instead. I guess it's up to you, but it's no substitute for a new mattress."
4,good buy so far,I bought this product at my husbands request. We love it so far. No more rolling to the center of the mattress.
3,muscle builder,"This is a good idea. It is a workout inflating it with the hand pump. If it were necessary only once, not so bad. But the air gradually leaks out and you have to pump it up again. It's hard to keep centered when you turn the mattress and if you live alone, it's a job to keep it where you want it. When freshly inflated and properly centered, it does fine."
3,You have to be into this sort of thing.,"One reviewer called these a ""total snooze"" while the other said they have low production value. Personally, I found some of them, particularly on the old methods of FBI and other law enforcement agencies -- quite fascinating. Put it this way: if you are in any way a fan of crime films these will hold at least some interest. As for the production values -- they are leagues above similar material from the 21st Century. Hundreds, if not thousands of hours of work that went into producing each of these valuable films. I appreciate the National Archives taking the time to release them."
4,An interesting read,"This book turned out to be a very good read. Some of the reviews had caused somewhat of concern; however, having read extensively on the airwar in Europe during WWII, I found this book to be interesting and from a different perspecitve. It is not the usual naritive from an air crew member; it does provide more insight in to the thoughts of a twenty-something person during this incredible time in history."
5,"Great, quick read!","This book provides a concise, albeit comprehensive discussion of RIP-1/2. It offers help with configuration, day-to-day operation and troubleshooting. If you do not have a lot of time but need to understand the fundamentals of RIP-1/2, give this book a read."
1,content free guide to RIP?,"Thank goodness for the large font, and wide spacing on this fluffy attempt at presenting a technichal topic: otherwise far more extraneous and useless information would have had to be included in order to make this book big enough to keep from sliding into a fold of flesh in my ponderous belly."
4,Ya Taleb Review,"This album was produced during Cheb Khaled's final days in Algeria, just prior to his emigration owing to a fatwah pronounced against various rai artists. For those who know Khaled only from his ""Kenza"" and other recent Western audience-influenced releases, the sound is more raw and the drum rhythms, especially, are less stolidly 4/4, though no less riveting in their exotic funkyness. The result is a much more spontaneous and improvisatory sound, and one wonders in retrospect how much was lost in some of the newer releases. Of particular interest is an earlier, more syncopated version of ""Serbi serbi""--one of my favorites, and the opening tune of the album ""N'ssi n'ssi."" No extended ""dance mixes"" here or interminable saxaphone solos, just an undiluted and feverish form of eclectic music, the likes of which have not been heard in the West since the demise of the Clash..."
3,Photograph doesn't show the correct color,"I really like the look of this shoe but when I received it, the color was a very different shade of blue from the one shown in the picture."
2,Unraveled after First Washing :(,"I ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button, snap, zipper, catch, or anything else that could possibly have snagged it.It was not nearly as soft as I expected for the price either. It was better than what you'd expect from your standard hotel towel, but it wasn't any softer than my towels from the JC Penny Collection.The redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet."
3,Not definitive.,"This is a report of ongoing studies, by many in different fields, of whether animals experience ""moral emotions, feelings such as guilt, shame and embarrassment"", if they're capable of inhibiting their own desires, if they ""understand the impact of their"" decisions, etc. I'm not sure how objective Mr. Hauser is however as, to me, he seems determined to have his opinion prevail as I can't recall one study he's accepted as valid. I'm sorry too that the studies are not definitive."
2,Disappointing,"The writing is uninspired. The organization is poor. Evidence is largely anecdotal. After reading the review in Scientific American, perhaps I was expecting too much, but this book was not at all what I had hoped for."
1,Slowly put the book down and run away,"I collect books of this nature. I put Lenard Ashleys book on my wish list. I wish my husband hadn't wasted his money. Some of the information in the book is informative. Some of it is interesting. The authors attitude throughout the book was very snide and belittleing. How lucky we (the readers) were, that he could teach us how superstitus, primative and especially stupid we were. His cutting remarks about Wiccans, Witches, Christians, etc, left no doubt that he felt above it all. Perhaps, his other (five) books are written the same way. I don't know, I haven't seen them in the bookstores. If I had had a chance to flip through this book in a bookstore, I would have slowly put the book down and run away.Anyone want to buy a used copy?"
1,Written by an Arrogant Jerk,"Luckily I did NOT buy this book, I picked it up at the local library. As I flipped through the first couple of pages I couldn't help but become increasingly offended. Dr. Ashley seems to know very little about Witchcraft or religion, probably because he doesn't care to know. He likes to scorn anything other than Christianity....there were even a few snide remarks directed at feminist. The whole book is written with an air of arrogance and prejudice. Someone should tell Dr. Ashley most witches don't even believe in Satan. Don't buy this."
5,Well rounded for all your Low Magic needs ..,I found this book quite simply a plethera of great information. I wish it was a little more detailed on the spells but either way it is perfect!!!You won't regret buying this book.
4,Fun--entertaining and it really works!!,I though that this book was fun to read and was mildly surprised that the spells worked!! But most of all I was generally pleased with the book itself and the affect of the spells.
1,As the saying goes - if it ain't broke... don't fix it,In this case that means STICK TO SCOTT CUNNINGHAM!! Save your time and your money. What a waste of paper!
1,Just not right,This book does not have any good spells none of them really work I bought it because of the title but when i got it I looked threw it and thought it was just a bunch of S*!t .dont waist your money on a book like this. This 261 page book is just a waist of paper and trees
4,What can I say? It works!,The only thing I didn't like was the lack of counterspells (I made a duplicate of my cat).
4,The art of witchcraft is amazing.,I am studying witchcraft as a proffesion.I am 10 yrs.old& am naturally connected with the moon. I love the moon & all the misterious magic it beholds.
1,This book is a Christian account of Withcraft...very bad.,"I rated this as one star because that is the lowest rating available. I just received my copy and will promptly return it. I was disgusted with almost all of the concepts in this book. When I read the spell for turning yourself into a hare, and it included the phrase ""in the devil's name,"" I had to close the book. The whole idea of the Devil and Satan are Christian concepts. They have nothing to do with Witchcraft.I feel that if you want a very narrow minded and sinister view of witchcraft, you will love this book. Writing like this fuels religious pejudices and breeds ignorance.Modern witches and wiccans have come a long ways in gaining acceptance in society, this kind of literature a major set back."
1,The Worst,"Words fail me... This book is just a whole bunch of occult ""stuff"" slapped together. He took anything and everything from all the ""hokus-pokus"" books he could find and just made a book; does this man even practice any pagan religion? If you are truly looking for a resouce of spell, magick and information this is NOT it."
5,First Dead SHow,This was my first Grateful Dead concert. I was blown away. The opening Music->Sugaree->Music plus the Playin' in the Band are worth getting this CD for.
3,Shape magazine...,I was subscribed to Shape magazine for about 4 years and recently stopped because it is not for your average person who works out at home. It is more for a person who bases all workouts around a gym. I personally used to love this magazine because it was made for a person who wanted variety in their everyday workouts. The magazine is just a hollow whole for many of us now. I saw that other felt empty after reading it also and I don't blame them. A lot of the workouts are not for people who don't live in a city or live in a gym. And I do not live in either. This magazine isn't for me but may be perfect for someone who love to work out in a gym and likes that structured workout. I also found the articles to be a repeat of my other magazines and also a little more dry and hollow!
2,"Some good articles, but....","Shape magazine has some good articles, and I especially liked the ""success stories"" of real people, but the magazine's image puts me off. As a mature woman and mother interested in exercise for health and fitness, I don't need or want to see scantily clad seductively posed teens on every page. Come on - do we need that image of ""perfection"" to inspire us to work out? I would prefer more emphasis to be placed on substance and up-to-date health and fitness information. Because of the skin-flashing covers,I was embarrassed to be seen reading the magazine, so I cancelled my subscription."
2,Good if you like to Pretend your athletic,"Shape Magazine is a joke. This magazine has more make-up tips, clothing and weight watcher success stories than anything about atheletes. I found this magazine dissapointing- not only do most of the models look like they couldn't run a mile without dropping from anoreixa but the stories are hipocritical (accept yourself and love your body; while the follow article is how to lose weight for thanksgiving and impress your x)"
1,Exclusion,"I am very diappointed to say that I chose your magazine to do a project that entailed a review. I was a little upset to realize that your target audience is white, young, upper-class, skinny women. The month of March 2002 only features 2 or 3 black women and a few women of other races, and one overweight woman (and that was to feature a success story). This is a joke, have you looked out the door lately? You can't exclude the diversity of races and sizes because you feel like it and throw one or two into the hundreds of women who portray the ""perfect image"", just so that you appear to be unbias. I regret to inform you that if I don't see a difference in your magazine I will be unable to support it. Just to inform you, I am 5'4"", i have blonde hair, blue eyes, i am 110lbs, and i am white.Very unpleasedA.T."
1,don't bother,"If your dumbells are silver, not pink, if you know what a hack squat,deadlift nose breaker, etc. is, you're wasting your time with this magazine. NEWSFLASH! you can be feminine and have muscles! I personally don't want to see a 100 lb. ""fitness"" model showing me exercises with plastic dumbells."
1,Good magaznie - Don't buy it from Amazon,"I love this magazine. It's always been one of my favorites. However, I ordered it from Amazon over 11 weeks ago... it still hasn't arrived! My order status has said ""shipped"" for a week. I would strongly advise buying it somewhere else!"
1,Won't be renewing,"I'm torn between cancelling or waiting until Nov. and not renewing. I've been reading Shape for about 6 months and am disappointed. I agree with all the other folks about the sickly, skinny 20-somethings on the cover and in the pages. How about us 40-something moms? I'm a YMCA member and workout faithfully, but I'm tired of the fluff and junk. I also subscribe to ""Muscle and Fitness For Her"". MUCH better magazine."
4,A great motivator,"I read the other reviews, and I have to agree that this magazine isn't entirely fitness, but that's what I like about it. I'm just starting to adopt a healthier lifestyle and this magazine has great articles on new exercises, interesting recipes, and cool beauty tips that are geared more towards natural remedies. Anyone who is working out regularly has the habit of feeling bored after awhile. Getting this magazine once a month boosts my excitment about making myself healthier and gets my butt back in the gym.My favorite feature of this month was a new stationary bike routine, complete with interval times, resistance levels, and an MP3 playlist to correspond with the tempo of the workout!! Great idea."
2,Not diverse and too much fluff,"I have been subscribing to Shape for about two years now, and its the same thing every month. I agree with A.T. who posted a review sometime ago, that Shape is not diverse at all. I have never seen a woman of color on the cover, and maybe 1 or 2 African-American women models. I too am white, but I would love to see a lot more diversity. As far as the fitness articles, they have some usefull tips but other than that it is a bunch of ""what to wear this spring"" and all the clothing they advertise would look good on you if you were a size 5 with a nice flat tummy. I think Shape should be more realistic in reaching out to the average women."
1,Has nothing to do with fitness anymore,"I started reading Shape back in 03 when I went to college and I wanted to stay on a healthy track. It was great and had tons of fitness articles and helped me perfect my form. Since then its simply become all about beauty and fashion with maybe a little bit of fitness mixed in. And the fashion isn't even that good, who wants to spend $100 on a pair of workout pants? I don't. What is most sad is that its extremely repetitive, it shows the same movements different girl maybe on a beach or in a field somewhere. I'm still trying to figure out why all of a sudden the buff toned models they once had grace the covers have been replaced with frail, thin untoned celebrities."
1,Not worth it,If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M
2,Doesn't fit Kindle Fire screen well,"I don't like that the image is square and doesn't fill up the screen making it hard to read. Also, I don't like that I can't keep them for several months."
2,Good for a free magazine,"I recently starting getting this magazine since I joined a Boston gym, it is apparently part of the membership. It is good magazine, but I wouldn't rate it as ""great"" When my free subscription runs out, I will not renew and purchase it myself. For anyone looking for a very helpful women's magazine, for whatever stages you are in...I recommend OXYGEN. Many helpful articals for EVERYONE!!!"
5,<B>10 YEARS OF SHAPE!,"I've read Shape magazine for 10 years and still can't get enough of it.How can anybody think this magazine is more shallow than Cosmo! Shape is about Fitness and Health, Cosmo is more into fashion. They don't even compare. I read them both, depending on my mood. To help motivation when I'm in a fitness slump.... SHAPE! It's worth it!"
3,"Love the magazine, Hate the ads","This magazine has as many ads in it as that thick/heavy fashion magazine I read once. Literally every other page is an ad, when is too much too much. Love the magazine though, repetively inspires me to be healthy and keeps me up to date with new workouts.... I might try her sport though or health when renewing comes around again."
2,This used to be a good magazine,"I really used to enjoy Shape, it had a nice balance of fitness, nutrition, and some beauty. It also would also contain very good articles addressing women's issues. Since the new editor Tara Kraft took over, this magazine has really gone down hill. The articles on fitness and nutrition are almost nil and the serious articles that really addressed women's issues are now very rarely there. She has basically turned this into a wanna be beauty magazine. On the editor's page, Valerie Latona would write about causes or women's concerns. Tara Kraft just presents a narcissistic catalog of all the extraordinarily expensive things she likes or wants. After subscribing to this magazine for years, I just got my last issue and I won't renew. How disappointing."
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would","I used to be a faithful Shape subscriber. Then I found more and more ads in it selling products that did not strike me as consistent with the good health/fitness advice the magazine claims to provide. There are all kinds of ads for quick fixes that have nothing to do with working out and eating healthy. You can find articles about how to have a healthy body image and a few pages later find ads for diet pills. I find more of the content about how to look pretty than how to be healthy. Then I started getting phone calls from Rodale (publisher) when I didn't renew. The phone calls got out of hand. They finally did stop, but now I cannot get them to stop emailing me. I have unsubscribed, emailed customer service for months now and the emails come regularly still. Just not what I want in a magazine. Very, very disappointed in them."
3,Average,"This magazine is only average. It have a few good exercises, but just cycle the same routines over and over. It is worth getting a Dec or Jan issue where they give you a bit more meat as far as fitness.Filled with more clothing and makeup tips than fitness. It is okay and a quick read. I don't find myself saying ""wow I need to keep this as a reference."""
2,Have not recieved,I have not received this and it was promised for delivery the first of the month. It is now the middle of the month.
3,Not bad but leaves me wanting more variety,"I've been a subscriber for two years, but I'm not going to renew this time. There are some great things about this magazine. There's always information about eating healthy, and many of the recipes are wonderful. Another feature is the Diary portion, where the magazine profiles individuals who have turned to fitness and healthy eating in order to lose weight. It's the most inspiring part of the magazine, and it's great that the magazine focuses on real women, not just how to tell those in perfect shape to stay in shape.I do wish that the magazine would have a bit more variety. I feel like I keep seeing many of the same exercises repeated over and over. I also wish the magazine would realize that not all of us are in to New Age spirituality. If you do choose to subscribe, don't be surprised to see the latest issue at the newsstand before it arrives in your mailbox."
2,Not as good as it used to be,"I've been subscribing to Shape for two years now and I have decided not to renew my subscription this year. When I first began reading Shape, it was almost solely dedicated to fitness and health. Now it's about 50% beauty and fashion (and a lot is articles that are simply trying to push products). I disagree with the writer who said that she wished they would stop showing moves with gym machines; this is one of the few sections of SHAPE I enjoy reading, as it does give great instructions on how to use the machines (definitely cheaper than hiring a personal trainer). But I do agree with the previous comments that the stories are starting to all sound the same from month to month - especially the success stories. If you're just starting to exercise, this magazine will be helpful for you. But if you're a long-time exerciser, skip this one."
2,Unrealistic,"I am a subscriber to Shape and I will not be renewing my subscription. If I had a self esteem problem looking at this magazine would just make it worse. I have been quite disappointed with the models used in the articles. Most of them look as if they are posing for Victoria Secrets and not a fitness magazine and they are extremely skinny. The clothes that are advertised are not affordable for the average working women and many of the articles are not that helpful. The only section I do enjoy is the ""Success Stories"" which portray real women in real life situations. I really wish the magazine would revamp itself and gear it more towards the ""Real Woman""."
1,Not worth it,"This is a ""fluffy"" women's fitness magazine. It regurgitates the same information over and over, just repackages it a little differently each time. ""Let's give readers the same workout with a red bikini this time..."" They use models that are far too thin and not even muscular looking for most of the fashion spreads, which seems to encourage an unhealthy body type. I also found the magazine to underassume the intelligence of the readers. Muscle & Fitness Hers, Oxygen and Fitness Rx are much better choices if you are serious about fitness."
3,This mag is too short,"I read through this in about 1/2 hour, most of articles are either uninteresting or repeats as well as the exercise and diet tips. I will not renew this one."
4,really enjoy it,"I always enjoy reading this magazine when it arrives. Whether or not I follow its recipes or exercises, it never fails to motivate me to go out for a run or hit the gym. I find myself itching for a fun vigorous workout whenever I pick it up!"
4,"It's the best fitness mag out there, but can be improved","Most reviewers I feel were really hard on this magazine. If you are trying to get into shape, this is a monthly boost to your efforts. The nutrition info is accurate and realistic, and the recipes are usually yummy, and provide all the nitpicky nutrition facts I want. The workouts are VARIED: some are things you can do at home, others require a good gym in order to do... but there is something for EVERY level. I like the motivational stories, and the non-fitness bits are interesting and relevant. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for the models they use: The ""reader models"" are realistic, but the cover models make me want to puke. How about a Jennifer Garner type (strong, muscular), not a heroin-chic model?"
1,Don't waste the money,"Mostly ads and product pimping. Takes me about 20 minutes to flip through it and rarely do I find anything that makes me actually stop flipping the pages and actually catch my interest. For what one would think, by the title, would be a somewhat fitness oriented magazine, any fitness related elements are sub par and often the photos or drawings aren't even proper form."
1,complete junk--beware,"Plays some VHS with static in the audio that other VCRs play fine. Even worse, the DVDs that are recorded from this machine are of very poor quality. Audio and video cuts out at random, creating very jumpy DVDs. This is from the brand new machine. I returned it within a week. Very poor quality. Don't put yourself through the hassle of having to buy and return. BEWARE."
1,A complete piece of garbage,"Job one for a DVD player (even one that records on DVD and VHS) is to play what you've recorded, and to play your DVDs. Good luck getting this hunk of junk to play your store-bought DVDs. Half the time, when offering you a menu, it will not highlight the menu items so you can't actually choose anything. Which of course brings your viewing to an abrupt end.As to recording, this thing does not allow you to dub digitally from an outside source to the DVD player. So much for the wonder of digital imagery.I'm very unhappy with the machine -- I'd say you should avoid it."
1,Did not work right out of the box..,"Returned it within a couple of days because various functions were not working properly right off the bat; VHS tapes were playing improperly, VHS to DVD record was operating at a strange ratio, etc.Thankfully, Amazon's refund process was smooth."
5,"Oustanding, Original, Never lets up.","There is something particularly chilling about a story that doesn't seem quite outside the realm of possibility...with credible characters and a storyline that develops at a naturally brisk pace. Don't be surprised if Stefan Bourque becomes a household name in horror. The only negative thing I can say is that I shouldn't have waited so long to read it. Stefan, I want more."
5,Well worth the reading!!!,"I have been reading similar books (including the secret), but as the little red start sticker says on the book ""Secret beyond the secret"" is true.I truly understood what Mr. Wattles talks about and this is the first time I really thought of it and said ""AHA"" thats how it works!Well worth the read, one of my favorite books I re-read every month!!!"
4,Wattles is Wild!,"This was a very informative and inspirational book well worth reading numerous times. It is impossible to get a hand on an original, 1910, copy, very valuable. Great job Wally!"
5,A powerful book,"It is note worthy that the author not only quotes Mark 11:24 but largely bases the whole premise of his book on this scripture -""Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.""It's like getting a blank check and all I have to do is to genuinely and sincerely believe something and I'll receive it. Consequently, I've had some experiences that I cannot explain in a three-dimensional world, but they still happened. Give it a 60-day trial. There seems to be something special happen when you break the 60-day barrier."
5,This is a clear guide to being rich,"I would suggest anyone who is serious about getting rich to read this book.Clear, simple, and powerful, it gives you instructions which, if you follow them,will shift how you conduct your personal and business affairs. At the very leastyour heart will relax!"
1,Wallace D Wattles is just not an Author(GIVE IT UP),"Utter rubbish, a complete waste of money and time. it was the rambling of an author that has no clue what to say and just kept on repeating himself to make his book have more pages.I listen to the audio book with my wife on our way to the airport, and for 30 mins, it was the most excruciating listen I have had to endure, then suddenly, I turned to my wife and she had the same comment, what the hell is he on about? yes the principles are true, but, OMG did he indulge himself, and bored me and my wife to absolute insanity.DON'T BUY IT UNDER NO SITUATION, YOU WILL PULL YOUR HAIR OUT IF YOU DO"
5,gift..........,"I'm annoyed at you, none of your business how I feel about the purchase, but I will admit, I boughtit for a gift for my grandson."
1,The Science of Getting Rich - For the Author !!!!,This book by Mr. Wattles is full of philosophies and not much substance. The original book was written about 80 years ago and it represents the mentality of that time. I don't think it applies to our modern age where financial information is freely available.
1,Mindless drivel,"What a crock! Science?!?! Oh yeah...I guess our scientists are so caught up in quantum mechanics and quarks that they overlooked the fundamental 'stuff', the 'thinking substance' that this joke of a book purports to be the elemental 'stuff' that everything is made up of. Apparently LSD was compounded around 1910 when this moron obviously tested some and came up with this fiction. Don't waste your money. If it's too late and you already bought the book at least you could use it a fuel or a table stabilizer. Don't waste your time reading it unless you are in the mood for some serious B.S.!"
1,Nothing to do with Science,"This book is absurd. The author knows nothing about science -- there is no usage of the scientific method nor an understanding of the randomness in life. A better title of the book would be ""The Religion of Greed"" because he misuses quotes from the bible to justify getting rich. The book is just a bunch of redundant uses of the idea of positive thinking. ""There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe. A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought."" Give me a break! If you must read the book at least download if free off of the web. Save yourself time and simply read the last chapter ""A Summary of The Science of Getting Rich"" and you will have a complete understanding of the whole book."
3,Nice to believe BUT NOT SO SURE,"I do believe most of us have the ability to get rich if we want to (with dedication and work) BUT The Secret and The Science of Getting rich is a bit sketchy. At first I loved it I thought it was wonderful and did everything to a T. I had positive results, but they use techniques that will work: Visualize your goal; Of course if you put focus in your goal it will benefit you. BUT TO SAY THERES THIS STUFF FLOATING AROUND THATS MANIPULATED BY OUR THOUGHTS???It's nice to believe we can just sit around and visualize and have everything we want these aren't book's there entertainment! I do believe human potential is unlimited BUT there more to it then just believing."
2,Positive Thinking,"This book proves that the psuedo, New Age science is nothing new. Actually, spiritualism itself was spawned in the late 1800s. Nothing new here, either, that has spawned books like The Secret and Robert Schienfeld's stuff.Think and it shall be given. I think JC said that as well. Pages and pages of repetitive nonsense. But it does have a compelling ring to it. What if it is true?I believe I will become rich. Not hopefully, in the formless void, dollar bills are being printed."
1,Terrible Book,"This has to be one of the worst self-help/finacial books I have ever read. It is definately outdated, and the principles lack substanance. He continuously says that you must do a ""certain thing"" but never gives examples of a ""certain thing"" don't waste your time with this book."
1,"think rich, be rich?","There is NOTHING of science in this sliver of a book.This book Summed up:You must think RichUse thought to bring form to the formlessThank god so it will occur.When it doesn't occur, you either weren't thankful enough to god or failed to think hard enough about being rich.PURE SCIENCE!I could understand someone in 1910 being impressed by this work, along with maybe animal-magnetism or iridology, but only a half-wit would be compelled by any of this today."
4,The Nuts and Bolts of The Secret,"For those who've read ""The Secret,"" this could be the main outline, the essential ingredients to that yarn. Wattles goes a little further to explain why you can't wish for things, they must be tied to positive action. Even though the title does not suggest religious overtones, Wattles is very much a christian, and casts his information in great humility. The unspecified action steps, he leaves to the reader. All you need to do is buy some discounted operating system software, grasshopper....."
4,The Science of Getting Rich,"It's hard to believe this book was written almost a hundred years ago, and is still relavent today! If you work the plan that is outlined in the book you can't help but find success in your life."
5,BAGH HUMBUG,"Don't let your inner scrooge, suspicious little person, insignificant fly of a 'logical brain' (when compared to the real YOU ~ the instinctual one) get in the way of you recognizing and accepting this book as almost a Masterpiece. The way that it is written, devoid of any judgement of the reader, and full...FULL of concern/encouragement/in short - love - is unmatched. whoever this Wattles is, may the Lord Ble$$ him in all ways."
2,Hard to read,Obviously this not the original book. It's very difficult to read and it looks like it was translated from a different language by a not so good translator.
1,Waist of time,This was one of the worst books ive read in a long time. The author took an idea and put so much puffery on it that you lost your train of thought on were he was going. Then he kept repeating himself over and over. It felt like i was listening to an old man ramble about the same thing for an hour and go knowhere. It felt as if each chapter he would forgot were he was taking the story so he had to repeat it. This book could have been said in one page. It was a waist of time.
1,Mindless drivel,"Perhaps the biggest waste of time ever. I cannot believe that anyone would actually have the nerve to print such trash. The Science of Getting Rich? HA! Maybe if you're the publisher, definitely not if you are the reader."
1,A Must-Read for Fans of Crackpot Literature,"The author seems incapable of putting two sentences together without saying at least one ridiculous thing. Maybe Wattles really did get rich selling baloney like this. If he did, I'm sure that's as ""scientific"" as he ever got. It's hard to imagine a non-imbecile getting any inspiration from this absurd book."
1,Get the real version of this book.,"Dr. Powell has butchered this classic to the point that this copy is not useable. Instead of the clear, simple prose W.D. Wattles wrote, you are left with the mindless drivel that Dr. Powell uses as examples to illustrate Wattles' points. Wattles expressly left out examples, and it was very effective. If you want to read what Wattles wrote, your only choice at this time is to find it elsewhere on the net, as the original version is no longer in print. There are a number of versions of this book floating around, but this one has the least in common with the original."
5,Plain and Simple,"Don't let the book's size fool you. This is probably the most thought provoking, yet easy to understand, book that you will come across in a long time. This book explains exaclty how your paradigm keeps you from your goals. Learn this and you will see that all your roadblocks vanish. If nothing else, you will see how cause and effect operates in the cosmos, on a grander scale than you can even imagine."
4,The secret behind The Secret,"This is the book given to Rhonda Byrne (The Secret) by her daughter, when Rhonda was disillusioned. It helped create in her a thirst for knowledge and so she embarked on a journey of dynamic discovery. Wallace Wattles wrote this book in 1912 and it still is applicable in our world today.Wallace tells us how to attract financial success through creative thought. He shares how to have economic and emotional security through a practical, imaginative and non-competitive way - while creating a loving and harmonious relationship with all life. This book has helped me realize the abundance which we all have, and when we recognize we have what we need, and are grateful for it, then more comes to us through giving and gratitude."
1,What is the definition of Science,"Until the formula in the book, which is 'the law of attraction' applied to money, is proved, i would call this book a Spiritual Guide to Getting Rich instead of The Science of Getting Rich."
5,A very good read!,"This book may be way out in left field for some, but it covers everything as it relates to life. If you read far enough, you will see yourself in some of the examples. A good book written by an author that seems to have been light years ahead of most in the area of consciousness."
1,CD version of the Science of Getting Rich,"The CD's are poor quality. The speaker repeats the last word of sentences and words ending with the letter S are emphasized.The chapters in the third CD are in random order.How did this product end up on Amazon's shelf?If this was something other than an instructional CD, I would have sent it back after the first 10 minutes of listening."
5,One of the top 3 self development books around,"I'll make this quick. If you haven't read this book, you've been missing out on one of the best personal development philosophies ever. I've been reading this book over 10 years and I learn something new everytime. This book will be one of the best investments that you can make in yourself. Wishing you the best in everything, Rob"
4,"The ""Rich Substance""....","This ""Rich Substance"" is available in ""More Abundance"" then your human mind could ever imagine!This book gives you a little look & feel into the understanding of the ""science"" behind the ""field of consciousness"" which contains every yacht, ferarri, currency bill, etc, that will ever be in existance! Imagine learning how to tap it... Pick up this one and welcome yourmind to the ""rich substance""Thomas S FisherAuthor: Pennies to Billions, ""How to Go from Broke to Billionaire, Step by Step"""
1,Why did Judith Powell rewrite Wattles' book?,"If you would like to read Wallace Wattles' book I would strongly recommend you read *his* words, not Judy's."
1,"Avoid the Ruth Miller ""update"" to this timeless classic","Wallace D. Wattles' timeless Masterpiece gets a disasterous ""revision"" by Ruth L Miller here. The frequent grammatical errors are a constant distraction. Didn't anyone proofread this rough draft? The language level is Dr.Seuz, at best. The word choice is vague, unidiomatic. The substandard language distracts the reader or obscures content. Sentences are marred frequently enough to annoy or frustrate the reader.Recommendation: Don't buy this supposed ""New"" Science of Getting Rich. Although this book does contain Wattles' original text at the end of Miller's ""revision"", you risk being too mind-numbed to absorb any of it by the time you wade through the so-called ""updated"" version that precedes it.Do yourself a favor to ensure a gratifying, powerful read. Just buy the original 1910 edition. It doesn't need any ""revision."" Trust me."
5,The Science of Getting Rich,A very easy read but astounding in the information it provides. Very basic life guidelines that will modify your daily thinking.
3,"Not Bad, but Rambling","There are some very good points in this book, but the author makes the same several points over and over and over again. The information is very useful, but it could have been put on a three by five card. It IS worth buying, and not that long, so I give it three stars - but be ready to go around the merry go round about a half dozen times!"
3,Not what I expected,"Purchased this audiobook after listening to ""The Secret"". This book is very outdated. Interesting, but not very relevant."
3,The Content is Fine but the Production is Sub-Par,"The information is mostly food for thought. This is not a ""How-to"" in the sense that there is no structure to follow. The production quality and the reader specifically was not very good. I think, because this book is as old as it is, the copyright is released so anyone can publish it. Well, ""anyone"" did :) For the price it's okay but remember the saying, ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Can't Even Start!,This was supposed to organize and save my time. It takes more time to input information than any similar device I have ever used. Just threw ten bucks out in to the street! Mike Reagan
1,Disappointed.,"When I ordered this Rolodex organizer from Amazon, I thought it would be a larger organizer. The picture didn't have a size which should be on page with product and when I received it, it was so small in the palm of my hand and hard to put information in. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I would like an electronic organizer where I can put name, full address along with phone number with email, etc. This item is too small and hard to handle. This is the first item I have ordered from Amazon that was a disappointment"
1,Reads much better than it is.,In my openion this product is a peice of junk. I trashed mine after two days of trying to figure out how to use it sinse the directions were so incomplete.
3,Too Old for New Windows 7 64-Bit,"Works great but doesn't save anything on the newer Windows Computers.Palm went south, so there's nothing to be ashamed about. Works great without the backup."
1,William,Returned this product because it came with a serial connector to connect to a computer. Franklin Electronics advised me that they did not have a USB connector for this product. Serial connections on computers were elimated a few years back. Definately not reconmended
3,Rolodex EZ file organizer pro,"Length:: 1:47 MinsThe Rolodex EZ file organizer pro does not come with a usb cable, it comes with a serial cable for older computers. I could not try the software. The two cr2032 batteries quickly discharged to 2.7 volts and the device failed to work."
4,Nice,"I purchased this parasol to go with my daughter's halloween costume for this year. It is beautiful and will work perfectly. It arrived very quickly, well packaged and for a great price. Thank you!"
1,Not what I expected!,This book did not have a complete review of the book of 11 Samuel. Second Samuel started out in chapter 7 and did not give commentary on chapters 1-6 as well as others. The information was good that was there but much of it was incomplete. I would not recommend this book.
4,Unsolved review of WW II,"it give the viewer in depth knowledge of how hitler conduct his war. Furhtermore, it show how advanced is the german armed forces in this period."
1,land of idiots,abysmally stupid...couldnt even get through it (and I do corporate sales coaching for a living)...of no value what-so-ever.
4,I expected more from Mothering. :P,"Let me start by saying this is not a BAD book. If you are looking for an introduction to Natural Birth, this is a good beginner's guide. HOWEVER ~ having been a reader of Mothering magazine for a number of years, I expected something a bit more earthy, natural, and... well, RADICAL. This book is not it. It does discuss a wealth of topics, and as an alternative to some atrocity like the ridiculous ""What to Expect..."" guides, this is great, and I encourage you to read it ~ as a jumping off point for something a bit more Natural, like ""Prenatal Yoga and Natural Childbirth,"" by Jeannine Parvati Baker.I walked away from this book disappointed, and with the distinct suspicion that Peggy O'Mara watered down her views simply to appeal to a wider audience."
2,not enough info for me,"I found the chapters short and lacking in information. I would recomend Dr. Sears' books over this one. I was very dissapointed in this book, dispite the fact that I love mothering magazine. Please, don't waste your money. Especially if this is your first pregnancy. I recommend The birth book and the pregnancy book by Dr. Sears."
2,raw egg in your drink?,"As an expecting mom, I was looking for books which addresses natural birthing practices and methods. I came across this book in the library and skimming through it, I was shocked to see that the author suggested drinking raw egg as a natural soother throughout preganancy and during breastfeeding years. The first thing that came to my mind is ""Salmonella"". I hope no mom would have to go through this infection."
3,review of mag not subscription.,I don't like ordering mag's so I buy them at the local wall mart they are always on time and up to date. Im no newbie to comouters I just love reading these mag's to see the latest programs and app's I can downlaod and try out. Plus the reviews are quite accurate.
1,For Enterprise use only,"Pc Magazine is great if you need it for enterprise or corporate solutions but, otherwise it is useless for home users. I used to subscribe to PC Magazine and also PC World, Computer Shopper, Mazimum PC and several MAC Publications. I still have all those subscriptions except PC Magazine. I have it at work but, that is where it stays and the only reason I get it is becuause it's free for IT Professionals."
1,PC World -Synapse,I ordered this on 12/23/08 as a gift and the person still has not received their first issue as of 2/3/09. Very disappointed.
3,PC World Subscritpion Renewal through Gift Certification Redemption,"I recently tried to redeem an Amazon gift certificate that I received from another site to renewal my PC World magazine gift subscription.While the redemption finally did get completed it took me several transfer from one customer service representative to another (whether it took one call or not I cannot remember) until I got an answer whether this gift certificate could be used to actually renewal my magazine subscripton. I wish the initial, or at least second customer service representative, would have been able to know this information.Otherwise, thank you for the great service your website provides.Reva H. Egdal"
1,PC World magazine,"I am unable to review the product PC World, I haven't heard anything from the publisher or received a copy yet."
2,Not the best,"I found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing. That's about it. This mag seems to be biased towards certain products & manufacturers. They neglected to open my eyes wider. The reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies (microsoft, dell, etc). They don't give credit to smaller, better, less-well-known companies and technologies. All the info is pretty basic for intro users, but if that's what you are interested in... then this is a great non-comlicated publication."
3,Only received one issue,This was a gift to our son but he said he only received one issue. What recourse do I have?
2,"Once Great, Now Largely Irrelevant","There was a time when computer enthusiasts could be expected to await each new issue of PC World as a child anticipates Christmas morning. But now the magazine (and many of its ilk) are rendered obsolete by online replacements full of up-to-the-second information and realtime interaction with readers (for what it's worth). What's left of this publication (and its companion website) is borderline tabloid quality scribblings from out of touch geriatrics who can't let go of their Wordperfect 5.1 systems and fresh, clueless pups who have grown up never having touched a command line interface, completely lacking any context.PC World will hopefully soon enjoy a well earned retirement and sip cocktails with Byte, Antic, and AmigaWorld at The Has-Beens Club by the pool.Save your money and buy a latte with breakfast every morning instead."
5,In The Know,PC World keeps me up to date with what's new in the industry and gives me lots of helpful hints to improve my computing experience.
2,Old News,"It's not just that you can get your information much quicker nowadays online, well actually it is. Everything in the magazine is automatically two months behind. Out of all the information that is provided none of it is very tech oriented or interesting for that matter. This is an uninteresting magazine not fit for a Dentist's office. You can find better computer information and news in Discover or Scientific American.Next time I'll just stick to finding PC info on the web."
1,Commercial magazine,There are way to few helpful articles in these PC World and some others. 80% ads and it's a waste of trees to make the paper.
1,PC World subscription,"I subscribed to PC World 4 months a go, did not receive one issue, tried called customer service but they told me the system had no address on it! come on! They put my new address and had to wait another 4 to 8 weeks!!!!What kind of subscription is this???? Something fishy here, I'm gonna give them another 3 days if nothing happens I'll cancel."
1,No Mag Yet..,"Wow, Ordered about two months ago, and still no magazine.If you want a subscription to start at a reasonable time after ordering, go through the publisher!"
5,I enjoy it,I've had a subscription to PC World over the past few years (as a gift) and I love it. The articles are very insightful and relevant. I can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue I'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that I'm looking to buy.
4,Pretty good.,"Well, I originally got introduced to PC World, by winning a free subscription to from a now defunct auction site. I believe my first issue was April 2002. It seemed to be pretty good (or great, seeing as how that was my first PC magazine [no pun] that I actually read). They have good columns, and news, and always helpful tips and other stuff, and I love the How To section in the back. It's usually thicker than their other PC competition magazines, and that's good. It's still a great magazine, but I just cant help but say that it's not as good, nor is any of it's competition, as is the juggernaut that is PC Magazine. If you want a real PC magazine, then of course, pick up PC Magazine. And if you want a good close second, then get PC World, however, stay away from Maximum PC {read about it in my review) and read about PCM in my review of it (if it ever gets posted)."
1,DON'T ORDER HERE,"I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ..IT TAKES 3 MONTHS TO PROCESS ORDER , BETTER TO ORDER DIRECTLY FROM COMPANY"
3,Could we at least have a synopsis?,"No one has reviewed this recording. I would, but I don't want to buy something when I don't even know which stories are read. Please print a synopsis. I haven't read a lot of Hemingway's stuff and, if it something I haven't read, I would like to buy it."
2,"bad, bad","I had for some time a Seiko speaking dictionary, but it suddenly died out and i tried this Franklin thing.Huge disappointment ! The screen is bad, pronunciation is bad, and it lacks some major features.One is incremental search: while you type the first few letters of a word, it should jump to the appropriate section of the dictionary and show you a list of words that start with the prefix. This is useful mainly because you may not know the exact spelling and try several spellings. It doesn't have that.Also you can't navigate through the description. Suppose you haveword1: .... description word2 more desc word3you should be able to use the arrow keys to jump immediately to ""word2"" or ""word3"" without having to type all of it.Not recommended."
4,Doctoral candidate,"I am a Doctoral candidate and this little gem was a must for me. I had a speller for years and it was time to upgrade. The speaking part of this device is the best! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it needs a backlight, so when I get profound epiphanys in the middle of the night I don't have to turn on a light."
1,Don't even think or read about it,I don't recommend you to buy or even read about what people said.so don't waste your money.
1,VERY BAD SERVICE :(,My order was cancelled without my notice and just an email was sent saying that my order has been cancelled. Will NEVER do business again.
4,Writer,I have an old speller thats just WAR out.Its been a great product all theses years.(15)yearsThanks Franklin.Its starting to have lines in the window and i can't see the words. Jim
4,Great Job!,"This is a great translator, have a lot of options and the pronunciation is so clear. The only problem, I think is speed! It's pretty slow specially when you use the ""Back"" bottom."
3,All good but speaking function,"The definitions are good, it is easy to use and have a good number of words.Also you can buy expansion cards if you want to learn other languages from the original website.But the Speaking function is useless. The pronunciation is totally different from the right pronounce.And by having the Speaking function it is heavier and bigger to have the speakers.I returned it to buy the other model without the Speaking: cheaper, lighter, smaller and with the same functions."
1,Product is disappointing and misleading,"Although the product description says on amazon.com it is ""Accurate Pronunciation"", the speaking of a word is not clear or even it is not accurate at all. For example, the pronunciation of ""quantitate"" is wrong. It is misleading. English is my second language. I am very disappointed about the dictionary because I wish I could use the speaking function to improve my pronunciation. Otherwise, I might have a much cheaper one without the speaking function. I think the product defective. I am asking for full refund."
3,"Not bad, not great","I like that it really is easy to use.It is nice to be able to read a sentence, type in a word and get the definition and pronounciation immediatly without getting off the chair and flipping through a dictionary, then back to the book.What I dislike it is that it was designed horribly.Dell,Apple or Microsoft could blow this thing out of the water.It has a qwerty board instead of a regular alphabet board.Only a fool would put a 100 year old qwerty board on a definition device. It has no back light so you have to twist it around to read the definition. Its not in color.Even Gameboys are in color.This is a 35$ device selling for $80.When Dell makes their own, I'll be in line to buy, until then this is the best. Oh one more thing, the pronounciation is out of Robby the Robot. s comes out as a z."
4,Product delivery,This product was delivered on time but apparantly we opened it only last week only and found that it had a broken piece in one corner. Is it replacable or will I get some discount? It seems to work fine but for the damage.I would appreciate if I get an answer for the damage.
1,quality problem,"I bought this dictionary for my daughter approximately 14 months ago, and it completely stopped working now. For a product costing this much, you would expect a longer life span."
4,Franklin 1870 rulz,"I have had this dictionary over a year. I use it daily. I use such features as a dictionary, synonims and pronunciation. English is a second language for me so those features are very helpful and importamt . Also , I like the way words are explained. They are explained in simple manner. If I have a trouble still to understanding a meaning of a word I press for thesaurus. Some other time I have a trouble to understand a word in explanation, so I underline it and press a botton for clarification. In addition, I use thesaurus for selecting words when I write an essay , just replacing the same words with similar in meanings. My children find it useful and easy to use too.I love the this dictionary."
4,Only one problem with the Franklin Speaking Dictionary,"I agree with all of the positive feedback on the speaking dictionary, but in addition I have one wish-list item. I wish some of the definitions were broader.Example: pe.jo.ra.tive noun (1882): a pejorative word or phraseI wish the speaking dictionary would have added an adjective definition."
4,Franklin e-dictionary is handy,"Love the dictionary, particularly the ability to hear the word pronounced correctly. The anagram game database needs improvement as the game calls common words like ""eat"" and ""ate"" invalid words. A backlight would be nice to have. Overall, I'm very happy with my electronic dictionary."
5,Franklin speaking 11th collegiate Dict.,"As a non native English speaker, this electronic dictionary helps me improve my vocabulary. I don't need to know the exact spelling of a word to look it up in this dictionary. Even though I enter the wrong spelling the dictionary gives me a list of similarily spelled words from which I can pick up the one I am looking for. Any word search is easy and direct!"
4,Franclin SCD-1870 Speaking 11 Collegiate Dictionary,Very useful dictionary with detailed meanings and funy word-games.
2,Sound Quality is Very Bad,"Its sound quality is very poor and unclear. Ten years ago, I bought another speaking English dictionary (model: LM4000, which is also made by Franklin), that still sounds better. Unfortunately, it started malfunctioning, that's why I bought the new SCD-1870. It's hard to believe that the sound technology degraded so much. If you try to learn to SPEAK English, don't buy this model. Very disappointed!"
4,A Fix it problem!,"POSITIVE1. The dictionary is adequate for my needs, and it functioned well.NEGATIVE2. The Cover is very flimsy! It broke off, and fixing it myself was impossible. This particular design part needs improvement.AN ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT . . .3. If, even at the cost of extra weight, IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LIGHT THE SCREEN."
5,Great Dictionary,Very good display. Excellent audio. About the right size to carry on a trip. I also bought a Bible cartridge so that I can do my daily bible study when I go traveling. It would be nice if it came with a traveling case to protect it.
4,"""Great"" for English but only ""OK"" for (Bookman) Spanish","I bought this for a dual purpose: to help with my general reading in English and (using the bookman card) do the same for Spanish (as a learner). The dictionary is still a few versions away from being polished up as a bilingual tool. Simple tools like flash cards or ""my word lists"" for instance, need to be much more user-friendly; when you need to get the definition of a word on the wordlist, you're kicked all the way back to the main dictionary and need to painstakingly get back through the menus back to wordlists, only to start at the beginning again. It's also a little slower than you'd think in its response time. Notwithstanding the above, you'd be hardpressed to find a better tool in this category."
2,"Beautiful design, funny performance","I used Franklin old version of e-dictionaries for many years and I WAS really satisfied. Then my e-dictionary broke and I bought this NEW! model.Very funny, very slow, somtimes you can nap...and poor in words. Just type the word ""London"" and you can NOT find any definition that ""London is the Capital of England""....overall it is not as previous Franklin company products. I comment Japanese or other brand e-dictionaries that are cheaper and more efficient."
5,wine lover,"i could not do without this. bought it for my daughter a couple years ago and she didn't want it so i used it. keep it with my book, use it for boggle, scrabble, etc. my daughter saw it this year and took it...i had to buy another with the bookmarks so i could keep mine!"
4,scd speaking dict.,"I have enjoyed this product, yet there are some words I cant' find in the dictionary. Also, the speaker sound could be a bit louder. The words define are clear and great."
2,aweful display,"The screen display is aweful. The background is not lit, and it is just hard to focus on the display. I do not know about this review talking about expensive and cheap models displays. I have got the expensive model, and the display is so bad that it just does not make sense to release such a unit."
3,Not as great as I thought...,"I bought this product to send it oversea for my niece. Everything is great except the speaking part. My purpose of gettingthis dictionary is to have the speaking function so my niececan learn how to speak as well. But it's a big dissapointmentbecause the speaking part is not clear and confused (ie: if youcheck ""feign"" it speaks like ""thing""). Since I already opennedthe box I couldn't return it. It costs me $96.94 but I can getother dictionary product without speaking function with muchlower price."
5,The only complete dictionary,"When you need to use a dictionary it's usually because the word you want to look up is unusual or obscure. Most electronic dictionaries contain 100,000 or so of the most commonly used words, which is almost useless. It must contain the uncommon words to be worth anything. This model is the best, and worth the higher cost. It contains words that aren't even in my large hard-bound dictionary."
4,A very handy tool for anyone who reads alot,"I found myself fumbling for the dictionary every time I came across a word that I was not sure of the meaning or usage. I am embarrassed to say that it happened more that I thought it would. I also found myself looking up words I THOUGHT I knew only to find they had slightly different meaning than I thought.From my perspective there are only three major negatives1. the speech portion is not a clear as one would like and more in line with the tone of a very, very early computer generated voice (think of the voice from the movie War Games)2. While there is some odd sort of way to connect this to your computer it requires mailing in some form and getting an odd non-standard dongle. While this may not be a big deal for some it would be nice to download an update from time to time3. The personal word list is great but way, way to limited at approx. 25 entriesIf you can get past those items, it's a great device."
5,Excellent Investment,"Excellent product! I have used this dictionary for almost five years now. It is easy to use, informative, and has withstood being dropped countless times. It has very good learning tools to help you expand your vocabulary. The ""speak"" tool has helped me fix words I had mispronounced my whole life. I love it...worth the money."
4,my sister is very happy with this model,I actually did quite some research before buying this dictionary. This was a gift to my sister in India. I was careful of the fact that I will have no chance of exchanging or returning this product as I will send this to India. Anyway my sister is very happy with this dictionary and particularly this model. She already owns the cheaper one and is not satisfied with it.So if anyone wants to buy this try to get this particular model.
4,Benjamin HB17,"This classic pistol arrived well packaged, good quality and all metal. The first few uses, I found it extremely hard to pump, even from just pulling the lever away from the housing. Then when I fired the first few shots, the grouping was spread out to 4 inches. I was ready to return the gun, but decided to give it another chance. After firing about 100 shots, the grouping started getting smaller to about 1"" in from about 30 feet range, with the help of a scope.I bought the gun because I consider it a classic and maybe a colectible someday, but it takes a younger man with muscles to pump this jewel."
2,Naaaa....,"The pumping act is difficult, the action is very hard and such a small handle to pump.I do not recommend it."
1,Completely wasting money,"I bought this player reading reviews from here, however it was a big mistake. Probably some reviews written by biased people.What's good:1. Sleek design2. Eject from remote3. Displays long file names in a scrolling lineWhat's bad1. Too long time to recognize DIVX disks2. Freezing and lips sync problem almost for every disk I tried including regular DVDs3. No support from RCA and firmware updatesThe player should be returned."
1,also had a terrible experience with this player,"This is going to be a bad review, but I just wanted to add to the previous reviewer's points on the failings of this player:1) only plays the first layer of dual layer dvd's2) software is buggy in a way such that you have to actually power cycle it on some occasions in order to recover from a failure3) this dvd player makes me sad"
1,Do NOT buy this player.,"My experience with this player is much the same as previous reviewers. The player forces you to reload a DVD multiple times before it will accept it (it locks up and won't play) and freezes up in the middle of movies. I received this unit as a gift and didn't want to take it back. That was a big mistake. Any DVD player that can't play all DVDs without flaws, is nearly worthless. I have and have had multiple DVD players in my house - one which I purchased seven years ago, one which I got free, etc. Every single one is better than this one.Do NOT buy this player, at any price."
2,RCA DRC240N vs AVAYON DXP1000,"I compared both dvd players. I am not pleased with RCA, there are no firmware updates for this unit. BUY THE AVAYON DXP1000. I am happy to say I returned my RCA DRC240N to BEST BUY. The AVAYON DXP1000 can be set to play DVDs from any or all 6 Regions, and future updates can be downloaded from the Avayon website when new updates are available for the divx codes, unfortunately the RCA divx DVD player lack these two crucial features, leaving you to purchase a new player with the latest updates."
1,"Awful acting, bad script and an amateurish storyline.",I was going to write an in-depth review of this film but I just couldn't waste any more of my time on this awful film ... please avoid and save your money.
2,Very misleading and boring,This movie was just weird nothing like I thought. It almost put me to sleep.
4,A Truly Beautiful Film,"The atmosphere in The Affair is dreamlike, accentuating the characters' internal feelings and how they see their surroundings, rather than simply showing the city as it really is. The film's greatest strength comes from its sad wisdom about relationships and the way its protagonists recognize how precarious their connection is."
5,Excellent book for young and old alike,"My third grade teacher read this book to our class after lunch everyday, this was back in 1958 and to this day I remember the enjoyment that we all received from this book. When my son was around 7 or 8 years old I ordered the book for him to read and I also plan on reading it to my grandchildren."
5,Captivating stories to read aloud to kids,Wonderful stories about growing up in the woods not so long ago. Fun to read and listen to.
5,My favorite.,"My all time favorite book! I read it when I was 12 years old and I have wanted to own a copy, so I ordered it from you."
5,Great book to read to your kids,"If you're looking for a great book to read to 7-12 year old kids, this is a winner. My third grade teacher read this to our class. Now, 25 years later, I'm reading it to my boys. They are loving it!"
1,Great book but this version is FILLED with typos,"I recently purchased this book as a gift for a nephew and bought an extra copy for myself. My 5th grade teacher read this book to our class when I was a kid and I remember it as a set of great adventure stories for an 11 year old. I was very disappointed as I read through this version to see scores of typos and misspellings. Love the book, but would not recommend this version."
2,Review not for content but for poor editing of this edition,"We're currently reading this book, and so far, the story is fine. However, this particular edition is very poorly edited! If possible, order a different copy than this one published by Wilder Publications."
5,A Long-Time Favorite,"Since my parents' families setteled in the Blue River area of Indiana in the 1800's, The Bears of Blue River holds special appeal for me. My father gave me a copy of The Bears of Blue River, which I have read and reread to my children and husband. Our 18-year old rates this book as his all-time most favorite and it has now passed on into his library where, I am sure it will be read to his children some day also."
4,Great Connector for Low Pressure Propane Connections,"The quick connector seems to be well built and durable.Originally, I purchased this connector with the intention of connecting it on the high pressure side to run a portable propane generator or camp stove that requires high pressure; however the connector is only rated at 1/2 psi (~ 11 WC). I decided to go ahead and utilize this connector on the low pressure side so I can connect it to a grill or other low pressure propane device in the future.Giving this one a 4 simply because the specifications were not clear when I purchased."
3,Slight leak bu good,"I purchased 2 for an outdoor beer cooker. I have a long hose but don not want to leave it and the cooker out doors all the time.They work as advertised, strong, easy connection and disconnect.Only problem is that there is a slight leak at the connections. VERY slight. No danger as long as used out doors and you always use a proper shut-off valve when done.DO NOT USE INSIDE EVER!"
5,Mr. Heater 3/8 male and femal quick disconnect,The Mr. Heater 3/8 male and femal quick disconnect makes it very easy to swap propane tanks between my heater and camp stove while in the woods. Previously I had to bring multiple tanks but now all I have to do is plug and unplug the appliance from the hose.
2,Dieter Bohlen und Thomas Anders,Nadine Bredemeier Dr.Heinrich-Jasper-Str.111 38304 Wolfenbüttel Tel.:05331 / 929412
1,This is not cruel - it's unbelievable,"In Germany, the home-country of Modern Talking-Stars Dieter Bohlen and Thomas Anders, both are named ""the killer tomatoes"". Why? It's quite simple: The music of Modern Talking is in the eyes of many German music fans only a joke.But what's really a joke is the enormous success of Modern Talking. Not only in Europe but also in the USA, in Asia and Australia Bohlen and Anders are successfull - very successfull. Everywhere No. 1-Hitsingles without an end.And this first of ten albums (until today) is the basis of their career. ""Your my heart, your my soul"" is a symbol for syntheziser-pop and the power of only three music-accords. You will laugh, but this album is one of the most sold one in the whole world. So buy it, listen to the dance-music and get to know, what the secret of Modern Talking's success is."
5,The Best Stuff Ever Invented,"Balneol is absolutely the best on the market. It is a cooling and calming cream, not like most on the market that burn you up.This cream actually came out a long time ago and it,s getting harder and harder to find in local pharmacies. I am 74 and my daughter is 44 and we both cannot live without it."
1,Not in it's glory days anymore,"Popular Photography used to be THE magazine if you wanted to learn about photography and get bits of learning every month about new equipment. Sadly, I have read Japanese Photo magazines that show us what a photography magazine should be. Thousands of photos in every issue, hardly any white space. Pop Photography is thin on content, full of white space, more full of advertising that looks like it was mostly done by a 12 year old who is not very interested.A real disappointment 30 years down the road.Don't bother getting this magazine, it should just disappear."
2,Disappointed,"Getting back into photography after many years away, I was disappointed to see the direction and quality this magazine is championing. Gimmicks and Photoshop manipulation are no substitute for the due diligence required to at least begin with a good image. Post work has it's place for subtle tweaking to enhance an image, but what I am seeing is a general movement toward the world as viewed through the eyes of science fiction and fantasy.Come on people! Show me what compels you to want to share your vision. Show me the beauty that only you see. Open my eyes! Ease up on the computer generated imagery of a world that doesn't exist."
2,Ad War!,"I didn't notice how many ADs were really in this magazine.You would think since this magazine isn't free, and you do have to pay a subscription, that ADs wouldn't be so overwhelming. Well...Out of the 152 pages this magazine has...108 of those were ADs.Ummmm...Maybe they should rename their magazine.Popular ADs & some photography.Atleast this subscription was given to me for free.If you want an artisticlly creative magazine with photos from people like YOU! then subscribe to JPG mag. You post your photos on their site, [...], and people vote for the specific category...if it gets the most votes, it gets in the mag. And no, I don't work for JPG...I just am very fond of their works."
2,Not a big fan of the magazine...,Very basic info in every issue. Ok for someone who has never used a camera but not very useful for someone who wants to expand creatively and technically.
3,Too many ads! Not enough info on improving photos!,I was a little disaapointed in this magazine... over half of the magazine is ads..... there are maybe 4-5 main articles in each issue.... just seems a little light on subject matter.... would love to see more on getting better photos in tough situations... new technology and overall more information on photography....if you like to check out the ads on new photography equipment then you'll love this magazine... otherwise I say pass....
3,not for me,I got this for one year and initially I liked it. It had lots of good review of DLSR camera and equipment and some good articles. Then it got to be full of information of the micro four thirds camera stuff of which I have no interest so I did not renew my subscription.
4,"A venerable photo magazine and yes, it is somewhat showing it's age.","This is still a useful and informative publication. I think beginners might find it especially helpful. I do think it's lost a bit of the ""edge"" it used to have, but I suppose magazines, just like people, sometimes slow down quite a bit as they age."
1,Have not received one issue.,Ordered as a Christmas gift in December of 2011. The gift was for my son and I found out after renewing for 2012 that he never received an issue in 2011. There has been no response from the provider. So far he has not received an issue since the renewal. I do not recommend this mag for anyone.
3,Good but somehow misses the point,"Everything about this magazine is 'OK' but somehow I didn't feel that it was what I was looking for. They seem to have everything: Product reviews, articles, ""how-To's"" and all that but here's what I didn't like:* much too few product articles* some articles are just not that interesting (to me)* 'how-to' articles are not very detailed. To me they seem not practical enough* this magazine seems to think that the only processing software out there is Photoshop. This is very annoying - all software 'how-to' guides are for PS only.So basically I have been getting this magazine for the last 6 months or so but have not decided yet if I want to keep getting it and I'm looking for an alternative magazine that will be more practical: have more reviews, more interesting articles and hands on type of how-to guides."
1,NEW FORMAT IS EVEN LESS,"Popular Photography has recently introduced a ""new format."" I have always thought this magazine had the least content of all photo mags. But now the new format has succeeded in delivering even LESS. Before you get into many articles you are already in the advertising section--and you'll ask yourself, ""that's it?"" If you have money to burn subscribe. Otherwise there are choices that will give you far more content for the money. Obviously the editor believes bigger print and large illustrations can save her some money. If I were you I'd save your money and NOT subscribe!"
3,Great for the price,"I got this subscription for an awesome deal, so it was worth it. However, as far as useful content, it's only okay. I like the UK photography magazines better since they're filled with less ads and have better articles. Overall this is a great casual reader."
3,Good magazine,This is a good magazine. They have redone the inside since the last time I read it. The format is much better now.
4,It's A Magazine,"Popular Photography is a magazine like any other. Some months it's features and articles are good; some months they're not. Helpful features on how to light earthworm portraits do NOT interest me but articles on using camera features that my camera has do interest me. Reviews of cameras, lenses and accessories must always be read critically because the reviewer's criteria may not be the same as mine."
4,Popular Photography review,Between it a few other mags it keeps me up to date on photography gear and software. My reviews are very useful.
4,"Excellent Reviews, Geared for Beginners & Budding Amateurs","The best maaginze, period, for equipment reviews. Quantitative, measured, consistent. The content is definitely geared towards beginners and budding amateurs, and year-over-year can become somewhat repetitive. It is not as engaging for experienced amateurs or professionals, but any magazine that is not a niche magazine for any industry or hobby shouldn't be fully engaging to a seasoned amateur or professional. If for nothing else, than we've already read a number of books that dive far deeper into numerous techniques and learning than any magazine could ever do in a two-page article.For what it is -- a magazine catered towards beginners and solid reviews of the latest equipment coming out -- they do a very good job."
5,Excellent content on techniques and gear,"I love the equipment reviews along with photo articles. This magazine would be useful for photographers at any level, mainly because of the new equipment and film reviews, but also for lessons and refreshers in technique."
1,Ordered Popular Photography a month ago,I ordered a 1-year subscription 1 month ago and have yet to get the first copy. What's up?
1,Not receiving the magazines after july,I got three magazines after subscription but dint receive any after that. Not happy with this at all.I even got another book from popular photography worth 27$ and after purchasing that I dint receive anymagazines. Don't know what went wrong.
3,Magazine subscription extension,"The magazine is great. Order processing was fast. but, I'm trying to buy an extension to my current subscription and it's not clear from the Amazon interface if it really worked. I'm still getting notifications from the magazine to extend. So the proof will have to to wait until my next issue comes to see if the subscription end date is extended or if I get two copies. So,...it would be really nice if on subscription extensions, a notification from either Amazon or the publisher would indicate that the extension actually worked."
1,Price too high!,"This price is way too high. Order off the Popular Photography site and get on year for $12 and 2 years for $18. For once, Amazon is not offering the better deal!"
3,good value for a great magazine.,it's a good news for loyal fans of the magazine like me. though it'd be pity that no international offer currently..
1,A disappointment,"As a budding amateur photographer, I was hoping this magazine would have good tips and interesting articles. But, instead, there's a lot of product reviews for things that I don't need. It's fine to have one section on products, but I didn't know that's what the whole magazine was about. I have a year subscription, but I just keep throwing the magazines away when they arrive. I don't have the inclination to look through them anymore."
2,It's all about the reviews,"This definitely a magazine for gearheads. It's pretty much just equipment reviews and advertisements. I would have given it a higher rating but for two things:1) I don't think I've ever seen Popular Photography not LOVE any piece of equipment. The reviews can still be useful if you're just wondering what features the new gizmo has, but still, they ought to be a bit more critical if they're going to be such a review based magazine.2) Many of the ads are from vendors with bad reputations. I believe they make some sort of claim about requiring a certain level of honesty from anyone they sell ad space from, but it sure doesn't look like they have ever kicked anyone out of the magazine to me.So what do you have when you have a magazine full of uncritical reviews, the occasional beginnerish article about technique, and a lot ads from stores of dubious virtue? At best a 2 star magazine."
4,one of the staples of photography,"Popular Photography seems to be one of the magazines that all photographers subscribe to (the only one I've found more professionals subscribe to is Shutterbug). The magazine is full of product reviews and technical articles, and there is a column on just about every area of photography. One major fault of the magazine is that about a third to half the magazine is advertising and mail order shops. It's good to know where to go if you want to purchase a new camera, but it can be a bit much. The other fault is that there are no articles covering the artists or any nontechnical issues. This magazine has a lot of potential to be useful to the photographer, but you often times find it falling a bit short."
3,Some good features,"I really enjoyed the segments where they tested out new cameras and lenses. I liked the part of the magazine that listed all the current cameras and rated them. But overall, I didn't think the magazine was that great. Definitely too many ads. I enjoyed it for over a year, but I won't be re-subscribing to it."
3,My Popular Photography review,I wasn't sure what to expect with this magazine. I'm glad it only cost me $5.00 for a year subscription! There are TONS of advertisements throughout these magazines. I liked reading the articles that were in them - which weren't really that many. The ONLY plus side to the advertisements is seeing the many types of cameras out there.
2,Too many ads,"I bought this magazine while waiting at the airport hopefully to learn something. Disappointed, I found too many ads in the magazine while information is so-so."
1,dont respond,"i send away for a 2 year subscription,they sent me a 1 year sub,i wrote 5 letters,sent copies of bank cheque and order form,emailed them,no response,they could care less,what more can i do ??"
1,Unable to comment,"I can't really give it a rating because I haven't received my first issue yet. I'm hoping it meets all of my expectations, though."
3,Very inexpensive subscription - and that is appropriate,"I'm a few issues into my subscription and I'd have to say that its worth the extremely low initial subscription price I was offered when I bought my new DSLR through Amazon. That's purposely faint praise. The self-help/instructional content is pretty sparce and it seems like the main focus of this periodical is to push new gear.If the renewal price stays low, I'll probably stick with it, as its a light read and somewhat motivating to keep up with the latest in the business. However, if the price goes up, I'll likely switch to one of the more serious photography magazines like Lenswork."
3,Nikon and Canon Magazine.....,"I subscribe to this magazine.....Its good skimming through type of stuff.Everynow and then a helpful article comes along. Mostly, its always about Canon and Nikon, with press releases included for other manufacturers.I just renewed, for the heck of it, but it is just recycled articles from the previous year, i.e. a review of last year's replacement rebel, etc. I liked it better when they had articles like day in the life of a paparazzo, a playboy photographer, NFL photographer, etc.Even the shooter of the year is online.This mag has a shelf life of about 2 more years before its all digital.Shutterbug blows it away."
1,Classic Spam,"This was already a mediocre magazine at best. Now I received an ""opportunity"" in the mail that my credit card would be charged $15 for an included DVD of photography tips. No worries, though, I was given the option to return the DVD and not be charged the $15. This should be illegal."
3,Amateur Professional Photographer,"Honestly, I appreciate the very indepth articles, the reviews, and the advertisements. I like this magazine, and would recommend it to anyone just entering the photography field via the digital camera. The articles provide a lot of training tools to increase your style, and learn your craft."
1,"Good for point and shooters, not serious photographers",This magazine is a joke. It is for people that do not have talent in photography and lack creativity.
1,PLASTIC CASE BREAKS EASILY,"The watch has a plastic case which contains the antenna for receiving the atomic clock signals. This part of the case is very fragile and breaks easily. The first watch lasted less than two weeks. The second watch lasted almost six months. Both broke in the same place.I loved this watch, but it's just not durable."
3,Worked great for a while,"Seemed to be a good, inexpensive watch with atomic accuracy. It crapped out after about 18 months. Display & hands were mismatched, re-linking didn't help. It had been beat up, scratched crystal & broken pin on the band (glued the band to the case, worked fine), both issues reported by others. Oh well, not a big investment."
5,Alternate reality no dream,I think the whole alternate realities series is great excluding pirate spawn this is a great toy I love the detail the look of the character is amazing mcfarlane has done it again i also reccomend wings of redemption spawn i have always been a fan of the mcfarlane toy series and comic books im only fourteen and theres people with grey hair who collect these things anyway if your a mcfarlane toy fan I suggest picking up this series
4,Very Nice,Never seen this artist perform in person but I did see a televised concert performace by him and thought it was very impressive. So I decided to look into any video releases by him to add to my music library. I was not disapointed.
5,Johnstone's Blood Oath - a fast pace ride of revenge.,"If you have read any of William W. Johnstone's books, you know he has a keen sense of humor and a sharp wit. In Blood Oath be prepared for his humor to be slimmed down to just one character: Detective Lieutenant Joe Davis. Johnson uses Joe Davis to take his readers on a fast pace, wild, and at times gut retching, ride through the brutal murder investigations.Without giving away the major plot, Blood Oath is a super charged runaway train - packed with sexual tension, over tones and graphic detail of rape, murder and multination; all in the name of revenge.If/when you read past the graphic details the true art of writing can be seen. Johnstone not only has a way of making words paint full color pictures, but he is a true master of ""hook `em - play `em & keep `em reading."""
2,So-So Adventure Story,"This is an early Jack Higgins novel that takes places during the time of the India-China war.This war occured in 1962. The book could have used a one page map to pinpointthe areas mentioned in the book. The book jumps between parts of Tibet, India, and China. Thestory is short (158 pages) and takes a bit of time to get moving. The first third of the bookessentially just introduces the main characters.The story revolves around saving the only child of the leader ofBalpur (described as an independent country bordering India) from the invading Chinese army.The story is pretty straightforward with no great surprises.The book is a quick read but there are many better stories written by Higgins."
3,Jack Higgins oldie,"Ordered this book for my private collection and could only find it on Amazon. It was a good read, but not great. It arrived well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged. Amazon is fast becoming one of my favorite places to shop... EP"
1,You got to be kidding.,"This book has nothing intergrated in it. This woman who claims to write the best physiology textbooks around must be lying.Her book is [not good]. It leaves out too many details, has a bunch of senseless flow charts that tell you nothing and provides no explanation. I have a copy of her book and it is thinnner the most physiology textbooks. I wonder why its thinner then most other physiology textbooks? Well its because she does not take time to explain the physiology of the human body.She maybe a good teacher but she can't write a textbook for anything. A 10 year old child can write a better physiology textbook.I would not buy this book at all. Bad book!You want a good physiology and anatomy textbook? I recommend Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook. Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook makes Dr. Silverthorn's textbook look like something you clean your car windows with."
5,The Standard on Civil War History,"Professor Donald provides insight into how the collective decisions of the past have led to so many of the problematic circumstances we face as a nation today. Professors Donald, Baker and Holt take the reader back to over twenty years before the beginning of the Civil War and continue through Reconstruction to examine the various factors and angles from which the entire history of the Civil War and Reconstruction is derived. The student of American History has everything needed in one concise volume to gain a working knowledge of the Civil war and Reconstruction era. This work is a well-documented, factual and detailed account of the most trying period of history our nation has seen to date. The work is accurate, comprehensive and concise. No doubt The Civil War and Reconstruction by David H. Donald will maintain a prominent place in any serious historical library for years to come."
1,What you see is not what you get,"This is not the classic game, it's the newer one with more categories but now their cut up into 2 sided cards with just one list on each side and where you put the cards has changed too now you stick them in this plastic thing inside the folder, it's not that it's worse it's still a fun game but I wanted the original like it shows in the picture and for that I gave this 1 star because what you see is not what you get. Don't get me wrong though it's essentially the same game with a few things changed I just hope the picture gets upgraded as did the game. Peace"
1,BORING. why can't I give it zero stars?,"This game bores me to tears. What I really dislike is that you spend about half the game NOT interacting with your friends. You are given an assignment (aren't we done with homework?), and you have to fill out a little form. Gee, that's what I like to do when I hang out with friends, fill out forms. Then you get together and compare answers. What is this, a study group? If someone thinks of an answer you didn't, your reaction will be something like ""Hey, good one."" Shouldn't games get you more excited than that? If they think of something off the wall, you say, ""What? that doesn't make sense."" And then they say ""Yes it does"" ""No!"" ""Yes!"" ""No!"" Gee, I love games that get me in arguments about words. Compare this with games like taboo, guesstures, and cranium. In those, you're jumping around, yelling, laughing, singing, acting, having FUN. Don't buy scattergories."
3,"It was a bit ""loved""","The product was old which I kinda o figured it would be, but not that old. All of the papers were yellow, including the cards. What really bothered me was that the timer wouldn't stop, you had to let it run all the way through or hold it in place if you needed a break. Love the game Scattergories, not this particular item though...."
5,Great Game,"This is such a fun game, I have loved it ever since I was nine when I first found it. You have to match the catergories to the previously chosen letter, and you have to be quick because you only have 3 minutes. You also have to be creative because you want to get different answers than the other people playing. This game is great, especially for people who don't like traditional, Monopoly-type board games (I don't). It's a good game to play with a group when things start to get boring, I bet you'll be far from bored after a few rounds of Scattergories."
5,CREATIVITY,"U CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITH 2 - 6 PLAYERS. BUT IT IS MUCH MORE FUN WITH ALL 6 PLAYERS. THE MORE CREATIVE U ARE WITH YOUR ANSWERS THE FUNNIER IT IS. IT IS CHALLENGING & ADDICTIVE. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS IN 12 DIFFERENT CATAGORIES, THAT START WITH THE SAME LETTER. THERE IS A DICE THAT HAS LETTERS INSTEAD OF #'S . SO IF U ROLL A ""P"", THEN ALL ANSWERS MUST START WITH A ""P"". SUCH AS NAMES, SPORTS TEAMS, FRUITS, TOYS, FLOWERS, THINGS FOUND IN A KITCHEN, ETC."
4,Excellent movie!,"The film centers around the Mirage 2000 and the French Air Force. I only gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons. The first is the audio wasn't great. The timing between the lips and the sound is a little off. The second is because the story is only B movie quality. What really sets this movie apart from others is they used real shots of the jets and didn't use CGI. They weren't cheap about putting the planes in the movie either, you will see lots and lots of the Mirage 2000 in action as well as a few other planes. If you have a love of aviation you will really enjoy watching this movie, if nothing else just for the film work they did with the Mirage 2000. You will see the Mirage 2000 flying over spectacular scenary and doing amazing manuevers!The creators of the film used a specially designed camera built inside a fuel pod of another Mirage 2000 to capture the aerial shots for the movie. Only another Mirage 2000 could keep up with the planes being filmed."
4,Awesome flying scenes!,"If you're an aviation enthusiast this is a great foreign film that will be right up your alley. The audio is dubbed, but the action and cinematography of the aircraft is second to none! I wouldn't even compare it to the classic nature of Top Gun. This is a modern film, captured with new cameras and a plot that is applicable to today. I highly recommend for scenery alone!I bought the dvd after seeing this - [...]Here's a smoother version - [...]"
2,Bad movie,I got this originally for the air scenes.Well it wasn't even worth the price for those as they were few and far between.Plot was lame.Waste of money.Sold mine to Hastings.
4,Too Hilarious!!,"Okay so she is a little harsh on each sign but Virgo but this is a great book for a lighter look at astrology and the zodiac. A little risque, certainly not for minors or individuals who are easily offended, however if you like a good joke and are interested in astrology, this is the book. Perfect as a gag gift too."
4,Beekeeping for Dummies,"Beekeeping for Dummies is very helpful for the beginner. Written in a straightforward style, it is easy to follow a process step by step. I would recommend this book to other beekeepers."
3,"Good, but...","This is a good book for the beginner. The text is entertaining and thorough, and the pictures are wonderful.My only dislike is that the instructions are somewhat dogmatic in parts. RE medicating hives, for instance, we're told that feeding bees antibiotics etc. is no different from innoculations. Actually, they are, and overuse of antibiotics is creating resistant strains of disease."
4,Beekeeping for Dummies,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who has turned into a domesticated wife and mother going back to her roots. She was excited, so I guess it was a success."
5,Fantastic Book,"I usually don't go for the ""Dummies"" series but this one seems really well done from the point of view of an aspiring beekeeper. It is well illustrated and organized plus the author has a real passion for his subject.I highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent book,This book covers everything you need to get started in beekeeping. The book is also very easy to read. Highly recommended.Shane
4,Good book for the beginner-me.,"I've read the book and think it is a good one. I haven't yet started a hive, but will use this book as my reference for this year. It certainly helps in considering all the work that is involved with bee keeping."
5,Beekeeping for Dummies,"As are most of the other FOR DUMMIES, this book gave many insights as well as basicinformation on raising bees. Would recommend it to anyone"
4,Best of all starter books,"I have been pondering beekeeping for 3 or 4 years now. I've read several books on the subject but never felt I had learned quite enough to delve into beekeeping. Enter ""beekeeping for dummies"". Mr. Blackiston explains everything in an easy matter of fact style that caters directly to the novice. I found answers to virtually every question I had as well as the inspiration to ""give it a go"". If you are wanting to keep bees but have been reluctant to pull the trigger, buy this book."
4,"Definitely for Dummies, like me.",This book is perfect for the beginning beekeeper who is starting with Langstroth hives. No wading through tedium to get to the basics.
5,Bible for beekeeping,"We've learnt almost everything we know from this book! Really offers complete coverage of all areas of beekeeping and the fun stuff too like recipes using honey, wax, etc."
5,Not a dumb Dummies book,Great information. I learned a considerable amount about honeybees and how to keep them. The book was chock full of information that was previously unknown to me...even though I have a degree in biology. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about beekeeping.
1,beware of dimensions,"Did not purchase the unit - Went elsewhere. Descripton at the top says ""2 X 3""'s but down below it says 5 X 5 (inches implied). What are the dimensions??WENT ELSEWHERE TO BUY 4 OF THE UNITS!!"
3,"Not the best, but still good","I purchased this product while rebuilding my transmission. Found out after going through 3 of these bits I needed the torx plus (ip). Would have rated this more but the tips seem to bend substantially when torque is applied to it.But for the price, its worth a try.FIY If rebuilding a transmission, check to make sure you don't need the torx plus, if you do amazon does have some, or you can get a snap-on one for about $25 like I did."
4,Great essay collection,I bought this book for my AP Language and Composition class and I thought that it's a wonderful book to study from.Although I wish that there were some pictures incoporated because you just get tired from reading essays after essays.
4,Interesting Book!!,"This book was totally worth the money. I purchased it for an English class at a very reasonable price, but really enjoyed the different essays. I probably would have never purchased it because I've never heard of it before my class, but I'm really glad I did. The book came when it said it would and in the condition that was promised."
1,product origin,I have made a choice to avoid personal products made in China. You should let customers know these are from China.
1,NOT SO JOLLY ROGER,"CROSSBONES is an incredibly bad film that spends most of its time focusing on the bikini clad women and the profane behavior of some minor league rap star (J-Shin?). At any rate, Joe Marino plays bloody pirate RedBeard, who is murdered by a bunch of natives in the beginning of the film, and placed under a blood curse. A group of incredibly bad actors take over as members of a ""Survivor"" type tv show that looks about as exciting as spin the bottle. Any attempt at plot coherence is shortshifted in the movie's attempts to parody reality shows, but there is no suspense or horror and Marino is especially bad as the vengeful pirate. Truly another example of the degeneration of the horror genre. No wonder they keep remaking classics like THE FOG or HOUSE OF WAX!"
1,Please save your hard earned money and time and stay the hell away from this crap!,"Because my girlfriend loves pirates we rented this dvd, knowing it would be bad but hoping for some fun silliness. But what we got was quite possibly the VERY worse film i have ever seen!!!The cover looks cool, but what you get is boring and misleading. A ""pirate"" film, no not really...sure there is a pirate in it, but just one, and he is on screen for a whole 5 or 6 minutes..the dialog is redundant annoying and horrible.Bad actingBad writingBad directionBad everythingFor thier own sakes I hope that anyone involved with this film changed their names in the credits, because there is no excuse for a film like this to EVER get released.Honestly, I do like and often enjoy, low-budget fare..but come on...I would rather be anally raped in a maximun security jail than sit through this trash againShame on you to the filmmakers who just stole my $5 rental fee."
5,Simply the best Olivia Newton-John Compilation Yet,"I'm an avid Olivia fan so I believe every CD is great, but, if you're looking to pick up most of her most popular and best songs on one compilation, this is the one to pick. From the early 70's to late 90's, all of her biggest are here. It's only a 2 cd set so I would've liked a few more but it does contain her biggest hits. Four songs though that should've been here but there wasn't enough room are Toughen Up, Precious Love, Back With a Heart, and I Need Love. Besides that though, this compilation is perfect for anyone trying to catch up with this excellent songstress."
4,I love her songs,"I'm a middle of the road Livvie fan. I love her songs, but she doesn't have the strongest or best voice out there. Sometimes it's a little weak. Having said that, I love the majority of these songs. I think the best are the mid to late 80's ones like Physical or Magic or Xanadu. She is an icon and she's continuing to do new material. This is a very good album that does so many of all the hit songs we know and love. It only lost a star because of her voice, but her music and the ballads are Magic."
3,Gold? More like silver.,"I realise this new compilation is part of the Gold series, but looking at a number of the tracks here, many of them were not major hits at all. In fact, many are largerly unknown even in her native Australia. Valuable space has been wasted with songs like ""Living in Desperate Times"" and ""Fool Country"" where great classics like ""Amoreuse"" and ""If we Try"" could have been placed. If you really love Olivia as much as most, your best bet is to buy her three Australian Greatest Hits compilations (Volume 1, 2 & 3). That way you get Livvy's most impressive tracklist."
5,Un buen disco de Olivia Newton John,"Este disco doble trae canciones de sus primeros albumes para aquellos que siguieron de cerca su carrera musical escuchar este disco sera toda una satisfacción canciones como ""Xanadu"", ""The Rumour"", ""Twist of fate"" ""Suddenly"", ""Physical"" Magic"" son algunas por citarlas el resto de canciones con su habitual tono de voz a mi me gusto este disco se los recomiendoatteHenry"
5,I only have 3 words to say....,"FINALLY, FINALLY, FINALLY! Okay, 4 more words: THE BEST REMASTERING POSSIBLE! Blew away all expectations, being able to hear long-awaited songs in the way that i remember growing up. Excellent mid-range, highs and lows. I will continue to purchase this Gold Series; i already am planning on Kiss, Cher (released in July, pushed back from March) and possibly Donna Summer and the Jackson 5. New anthologies can never be enough, when they get the song selection and the remastering down pat! Worth waiting for! Don't waste your time looking for these in the stores if you can just purchase them here!"
4,Nice Collection,"This CD is basically a good overview of Olivia's career. It includes the hard to find ""If Not For You"". It 's fun to listen to....brings back memories of a nicer time and lots of personal memories listening to these hits. The CD also includes all hits though Olivia's ""Country Music Phase"" And the hits from the more pop oriented ""Totally Hot"" and ""Physical"" albums. Hits from ""Grease"" are also here.....I really recommend to anyone from the fan and the casual listener !"
5,"Great compilation, an amazing singer","Congratulations to Hip-O, Universal Records for this very comprehensive collection...probably the best up to know. Gold shows Olivia at her best: voice, songs, versatility. The original recordings have been remastered and the sound is cristal clear...Olivia Newton-John is a pop classic, no doubt about it!!"
4,Good historical fiction from 17th century Ireland,"As a fan of Fantasy/Sci-Fi, this book was a good read during a recent trip to Ireland. Mr. Macken weaves a terrible time in Irish history (Cromwell's march through the Ireland sacking and looting) into a work of fiction that is part heroic epic, part Catholic religious teaching, and part pure allegorical myth-making.As a non-Catholic and only part Irish American, this was interesting for it's descriptions of the role the church played during these times and the descriptions of day-to-day life in the Connemara countryside during the mid to late 17th centruy.This is more Michael Moorcock than it is Oxford History, though...If you could lie on a beach on Galway Bay and read a novel, this would be a great choice. This is part of a trilogy Mr. Macken wrote before his untimely death at age 52(?). The other two novels cover more recent periods in Irish history."
1,How do I know?,I have never gotten this product so it's hard to know how to rate it. Wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner.
5,Gift Subscription,"I bought this as a gift subscription in October 2009 for a Christmas gift. First issue was received by my friend before Christmas. He loves it! I haven't seen any issues, but he says he enjoys it very much each month. It's a gift that keeps on giving and it turned out to be a great idea for a present."
4,Best price!,"If you drink a lot of this tea, this is the only way to buy it! It also make great iced tea."
1,bitter,"I was greatly surprised by this, and now am stuck with 6 boxes of tea I can't stand. ANY other tea is better-even the cheapest in the grocery store. BTW, true Orange Pekoe tea has no orange flavor- it refers to grading by leaf appearance, and the appearance here is very good, so I am at a loss about the taste. If I use 1/2 tsp of this with 1/4 c of other loose teas, it ruins the flavor of the whole batch. I have not been disappointed by Twining's other varieties. This tastes NOTHING like Ceylon tea."
2,Well it was worth a shot,"Sadly, this is pretty crummy tea. For decent Orange Pekoe, I remain sold on Typhoo."
3,The Heritage Universe series improves with the second book.,"With the second book of the Heritage Universe series, Sheffield kicks things into high gear. All the characters from the first book are back along with the addition of E.C. Tally, a computer brain in a human body. The book gets a fair amount of comedy out of the discrepancy between his Federation supplied databanks and real galactic affairs.But the main drama comes from further exploration of Builder artifacts and a meeting with artifical constructs of theirs who may or may not be telling the truth about the Builders' origins and the purpose of their artifacts. Also making an appearance are the legendary Zardalu, land-octopi thought long dead after their Empire was overthrown by their underlings.Sheffield also throws in some inventive entries from the Universal Species Catalog for humans and aliens, major and minor."
2,Simplistic sci-fi.,"All three books from this series feature simplistic and uninteresting plots. The dialogue is wooden and the characters have all the dimension of a sheet of blank paper. If you've already bought these books then read them, everyone else give them a wide berth. They do have beautiful cover artwork and design though. You want to read something good from Sheffield? Read ""My Brothers Keeper""."
1,bland bland and oh yeah bland,that has got to be a friend of there's praising this band... this album is the most uncatchy bland power-pop-punk band in existence. just listen to the available tracks and i don't doubt you will agree. each song doesn't even warrant 30 seconds of your time
1,Not edible,"I sincerely tried to lick it off the skin. It tastes horrible. I have no idea if it's the product quality or the product itself. Not thrilled, returned it."
4,"80's German disco/Pop/synth, Very Romantic","It was 1985, second album by MT, and Dieter Bohlen's house was still filled with Euro-Disco Romance... Simple yet Romantic lyrics and Romantic Synth melodies that hit very close to the heart (isn't that where it matters the most?).Although it's my opinion that the high-pitched (BeeGees-like) choruses could have been used less. They get annoying after some time, and are a bit overused by Dieter, not just on this album, but on many others that followed.Otherwise this album is perfect, with very touching and beautiful songs; lyrics are sometimes a bit corny (Warning!).....but still it's Great stuff. It's one hit followed by another, starting with the commercially successful single ""Cheri Cheri Lady"" to the last song on the album ""Let's talk about Love"".Beautiful stuff here, beautiful. It's a big part of my musical experience."
3,It's still Slade,"I'm too young to really count myself as a true Slade fan (b 1967), but as a fairweather Slade fan I can say that this effort is probably as good as any Slade release. The fact that keyboards enter the mix doesn't disturb me too much. Several cuts like ""Mizsterious...."" actually benefit from the melody the keys give since the rest of the music itself has little hook to grab the listener. Jim Lea's music is true to the style Slade has mined for decades (pub sing-a-longs) and the rest of the band delivers with a fish-and-chips-washed-down-with-ale style. I pulled this album for a listen from my collection for the first time in about 10 years the other day and still enjoyed it. God save the Slade."
3,Keyboards! (part 2),"A great bunch of songs, but the synth/keyboard parts detract at every turn. ""Little Sheila"" is the only song that seems to have been able to incorporate the key noise without it sounding totally out of place. Listening to ""Hey Ho"", you wish ""keyboardless"" mixes or demos were available - it rocks, but gets mucked up with synth.I guess we can thank Van Halen's ""1984"" for this choice of instrumentation. Overall an excellent set of songs, unfortunately frozen in time."
2,Not as good as I expected,"Im a Flex 3401 user.pro:Longer buffing time than M105Easily wipe offCon:It states no dusts but It actually DUSTs on me with 3 passes (primed pad with 3 more pea size product)Less cut than Meguiars m105, D300, Optimum hyper compoundThe bottle was defective as the Optimum hyper spray's head that I bought before."
4,A fine review of Post-Franco Spain,Paul Preston's study of Spain's year of transition following the death of Franco is extremely useful to understand the triumph of democracy in a country with little previous experience in liberty. A highly recommendable book for anybody interested in comtemporary Spanish history or for political scientists interested in transitions from authoritarian rule to democratic rule.
5,Fun for ALL,"This is a great toy not just for kids, but adults as well. It's great for improving hand and eye coordination for kids. No one could put it down."
5,A Fun Game For Your Brain AND Your Body!,"This is a great game to play! I have wanted this always, and ever since I got it (Christmas), I wouldn't put it down! This is a great game to sharpen your nerves and use your fingers. Buy Bop It, it's a cool game!"
5,What a blast!,Santa brought this to my 6 year old daughter and she has hardly put it down. It was also played with by every other member of the family on Christmas day. The sound is pretty loud but I don't find it anoying. It's great that she can play by herself or with a group. I am very pleased with it.
4,Bop It - Is it a game or is it real?,"So, I'm minding my own business, doing my work, when my boss runs up to me with Bop It. ""You've got to try this!"" he demands, a maniacal look in his eye. I gingerly take the odd plastic toy. It looks like some tribal weapon, a misshapen club. My boss smacks the large ""Bop It!"" button, and immediatly the thing starts emitting a drum beat. Convinced it's possessed by some ancient god, I'm about to cast it away when it yells, ""Bop it!"" I instinctively hit the button. The drums continue. ""Pull it!"", the toy barks. I desperately yank on one end. The drums continue. ""Twist it!"" is the next command. Twist what?! I panic, then make a grab for the little twister device on the other end. ""AAAaargh!!!"" yells the machine, like a man falling off a caldera into molten lava. I was too late! The drums stop.My hands shaking, I put the toy down."
5,Don't give it to an adult...you'll never get it back!,"I worked for one of the marketing agencies that had Bop It as a client. We all decided that we needed to try it to see how to market it. After 3 days, several of us had it mastered, most of us were good, but we ALL had done nothing but play it for days!! It's good for self-challenge, eye-hand coordination, ear-hand coordination, etc. It's a great toy - and you can give one to your boss if you want to keep him/her busy for a few days..."
5,"Not, for the timid at heart.","We were having our usual team meeting, when my coach announces she has a team building activity. Out of her bag she pulls this ""strange"" looking gizmo. After giving us our instructions, the challange begins. Who will be the last person standing. It was great watching adults young and old try to keep up. My turn came, I took this thing in my hands... Bop it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pass it I'd made it through the first round. We all had a great time and it was a great meeting. I enjoyed the game so much I now have my own. (I actually purchased it the same day.) I came home ready to challange my twelve year old. I won!!! Bop It is now one of the favorite games in the home. It rarely stays out of sight because everyone wants to play it. My neices and nephews ages 5-12 all enjoy playing. My six year old nephew almost be ME... the master! Once you play it you will want to own it. A great toy!!!"
5,Goofy,How in the world could something this goofy be educational? It's cool. I've seen people play it so much that that they can play it forever without even having to look at it. It's Ok.
5,"Bop It Can Be Educational, Buts Lots Of Fun.","Bop it can be fun and educational for kids at the same time. I'd say you learn with Bop it because you have to listen to what it says and then repeat it. You have to move fast and it doesn't repeat itself, it just makes you start over again. It gets you also to be able to move quickly, thats how Bop It is used, and educational."
2,"C'mon, It's getting OLD!","I wanted this toy last Christmas, I was filled with excitement for the first times I played it. The only flaw in this game is - it's getting OLD! It's a very repetitive game, the only things you hear it say is ""bop it, twist it, pull it..."" and again, and again, and again!! You can only play about 2 different games with it, when it tells you what to do, or when it plays the noise and you have to pick what it did. I wasn't satisfied with this item, although it probably will never break it's NOT unique and most of all - it's NOT fun!"
1,"Great Idea, Poor Design",A big disappointment for my seven-year old. It is too difficult to use and would greatly benefit if it had a means of adjusting the speed/complexity of the toy's operation.
4,my comments for the bop it game.,"i would give this game all exelent 5's for all questions on this survey, however,earlyer this morning i had a very unpleasent experience with my bop it game."
2,"""Realities of War"" - Philip Gibbs","""Realities of War"" by Philip Gibbs.This book is a word-by-word reprint of Gibbs' ""Now it can be told"" from 1920 under a new title.Great disappointment!Kind regardsSvein Buesvein.bue@chello.no"
2,Only useful if you want to translate English to Romaji,"So far I have found the book to be of limited use because it is strictly a dictionary to translate English words into Romaji. When I had purchased it, I expected an English-Romaji & Romaji-English book much the same as I have with similar dicitonaries I've purchased for Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. No luck here. As my intention in purchasing the book has been to read a Japanese book I have which is in both Kanji & Romaji, this book was to aid me in reading and as such is useless.Maybe it was my fault, but I didn't recall any clear explanation in the book's description that it was strictly English-Romaji."
5,So Much Info!,"I haven't completed the book yet, but there is so much information, and I love the way it is connected. I am just breaking into energy healing and love the way that this book combines so many genres. I soon hope to share what I've learned with those who are suffering and help them feel better."
3,Still reading this book,This book is very comprehensive and detailed. I am still reading this book. I hope to finish it within the next two months.
2,for beginners,"The program begins with REALLY basic material, such as introductions/greeting, etc. I found it frustrating, only because I have taken three levels in college and two in high school. If you have a good foundation of the language, skip the first (French I) and just order the second and third. It's definately a waste of $ and there are other books out there that are a fraction of the cost and will help you build vocabulary.For those who have no understanding of the language and are just learning... this will be great because it explains why they use certain words and it goes reeeaaally slow and gives you a chance to practice speaking.As a general observative for all levels, it's basically a vocabulary builder and basis for everyday conversation and will not help with grammar/writing."
3,did she or didn't she have anything to do with the producing,"I agree about this being a disappointment, walking on sunshine is a publicity stunt. Now don't get me wrong, there is no bigger fan than I when it comes to dolly parton, I adore everything the woman does, however, this is no peace train, the mistake with the junior edited mix really bites, this is the original track from the treasures album with no alterations. Two Doors Down is a fierce track and should be the one used to promote this new single, i do like walking on sunshine, but it is no peace train, and the speaking of that, the euro bounce mix of that i found a bit better than walking on sunshine, i like it, but i am also not pleased after two years of anticipation. . . . . ."
1,Not For Resale,This CD has a razor mark. In other words it has a cut through the barcode so it is Not ment to be sold. Record companies do this on promotional material and it makes it so you can not resell the item. Being a collector I was truly disappointed.
2,Dolly Dolly Has Now Fallen Off Her Trolley!,"Not too sure about this one. After purchasing a lot of Dolly's c.d.'s over the years i have been waiting for a remix album to be done. If you purchased the single 'Peace Train', don't expect this c.d. to sound the same. I found this c.d. to be difficult to listen to, the mixes of 'Two Doors Down', what on earth is that!! Be aware that most of these tracks are not easy on the ear, and most tracks have been severly altered heading really i think across the border into techno/trance land. Call me old fashioned but if the same formula was used using the club mix of 'Peace Train' as an example, I think a better result would have occured."
3,A little disappointing.,"I was actually a little disappointed with this concert. It was good to see David Byrne well and sounding great. However the show just lacked energy. It doesn't even come close to the Stop Making Sense Concert/DVD. The songs were nice but were lacking fullness by not having some good soulful women backround singers. Instead there was an extremely annoying string section which I thought sounded completely out of place and hokey. I rarely like it when classical musician's sit in with rock bands, just stales everything up. Stop Making Sense is 5 stars all the way, awesome. This Concert a generous 3 Stars given."
2,disappointing concert,"i am a big talking heads fan.david byrnes career and songs post theads is a mixed bag to me.i thought rei mambo had a lot of terrific songs but none on on this dvd.the bands intensity is low key,the crowd is subdued, alot of songs just arent that great.native melody which i love just isnt that good.overall very disppointing.not much improvisation accompanying the basic tunes.you want some great concert dvds-u2 at sloan casle or elevation tour,bruce springsteen in spain or nyc,meatloaf in melbourne australia,cyndilauper.another disappointing one is david bowies latest concert dvd."
3,"No talking, just perform!","David Byrne continues to be my favorite artist. This is a good concert, very representative of his last tour. It's not the most energetic concert, but it is great to see David comfortable on stage. Whay really bothers me about this DVD is the interview/interludes between every song. Sheesh! Save it for the commentary track!"
4,A little salt and pepper with that?,"David Byrne has plenty of salt and pepper on the top now, and he has lost a lot of the youthful energy that he possesed in his earlier days (don't we all). And his voice isn't quite as strong as displayed on ""Stop Making Sense"". But what makes this worthwhile, is that he still has that wild look in his eyes. That's worth the price of admission.For me, I get bored with so much music that sounds the same. David Byrne is ALWAYS refreshing."
5,best ever!!!,well organized & researched; written in laymans terms to get you the best help!!!! love stephanie's talent
5,Vacation Memories Plates,"My husband made these plates when he was a kid 35 years ago and our kids eat off them when we visit Grandma and Grandpa. They get a real kick out of it! Now we make our own plates after each vacation. We've got about 20 plates now (we have four kids) and we use them for lunch day after day. Tip: take away the black marker from you kids and don't have them draw with pencil first unless very, very lightly. I go back and erase all i can when they're all finished. What the rater said about the ordering is true. I just make my own forms and send them on. I've never had a problem. Customer Service told me to do it that way. I do wish they'd send out more forms and mailing boxes though as they are an odd size. It's worth it though!"
2,save your money!,"While it's nice to have the kids drawings on a plate, be aware that the kit's price only includes ONE free plate. Shipping is $3 and you have to pay $7.95 for each additional plate you want.The plates cannot be used in the microwave, which makes it very inconvenient when you want to serve warm meal. If you lost the order form, forget the free plate, you paid your money for nothing!!!! Customer service will not help you, you'll have to pay $7.95 plus $3 shipping, that's in addition to the $12.99 you paid for the kit!!! I think I'll keep my kids' drawings on the wall and not bother sending for the plate!"
1,Boo Hiss,"These plates are ok if your just planning on placing them on a wall, but if you are planning on actually physically using them, they are worthless. You can't microwave and dish washing isn't a great idea. Nice that it includes markers, which are pretty decent, but for the price you pay they should upgrade their plates to at least make them microwave safe or something!"
5,Interesting Book in Excellent Condition--Arrived Quickly from U.K.,This is a fascinating book. Arrived in new condition and quickly from U.K.--faster than book ordered at same time in country.
1,Not worth your time,"As an undergraduate student starting to learn about Psychology, I picked up this magazine expecting useful articles (as the title seemed to imply). I was intensely disappointed. Instead of articles, the magazine contains useless quizzes not even interesting enough to warrant a look.If you want gossip, pick up People [6-month subscription] or Star Magazine or a thousand other different gossip magazines out there.If you want real psych content, pick up a copy ofScientific American Mindinstead.On your way out you might be interested inReaders Digest - U.S. Edition, Newsweek orTIME [1-year subscription]."
2,"Lots of Flash, Little Substance","Psychology Today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman, but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements. I give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout, and a second star for hiring writers that don't insult the reader's intelligence by abusing alliteration (unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults). However, the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people. I have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect, rather than simply a personality trait (so, introverts, if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong, avoid this rag)."
1,'Sold out' publication!,"Psychology Today use to be great magazine with actual psychology that anyone could use on a level of laymen knowledge. Over the past few years is has become a gossip column for teenagers (and directed as retail sells, toward the female gender/ shopper). Sad. You may want to buy/ find former issues and clearly 'learn' the difference. Compromises reality and creates fantasy. Sad, just sad."
4,"Risque Covers, Relevant Contents","Yes, the magazine has ""risque"" covers, but that's to get people to pick it up. And then, hopefully, someone who wouldn't have otherwise read a factual, informational, psychological magazine will read it. I feel the stories are designed to be interesting to a wide range of people, and they keep the diction simple enough so that even if you're not a psych student you can make sense of it. I also think the stories bring relevance to psychology - it's not all about people with disorders and treatments, etc - it relates to day-to-day thought processes and behavior. Besides, if you're a psychology student, you shouldn't be expecting this magazine to substitute a textbook or published study. I'm a psychology student, and I find the articles refreshing - they're informative, relevant to society, thought-provoking, and teach without shoving theory after theory down your throat."
1,Does not Substantiate its Claims,I'll agree with the consensus that this magazine is mostly fluff. Little effort is made to provide evidence to support their claims. Even when they attempt to be unbiased by asking questions of both sides they completely fail at backing their statements up. This magazine is sewn together with the threads of generalizations.
2,For women only!,"When I started my subscription with Psychology Today it contained sound, scientific facts, studies, advice etc. It has since become a women's intrest magazine with advive based on unscientific, anecdotal evidence and a lot of articles on ""spirituality"". Women may like the new focus of the magazine but if you are looking sound information on Psychology you will not find it in Psychology Today."
2,Kind of boring,"I got a year of this magazine but I don't really like it. I also ordered ""Scientific American Mind."" They are pretty much exactly the same. They quote university research projects that should be named ""Proving the Obvious."" Why are universities researching this rubbish? There are so many more important problems that the world could use some help with. What a waste of fine minds."
2,Not a Journal,"I would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn't worthy of its title. I subscribed before reading review, I was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read, though some stories are interesting I'm sure I'd be able to find them in other magazines like Vogue or Cosmo. and there is plenty of ads, probably more than stories. And much like other reviewers When I first ordered it, it took forever for the first issue to arrive, now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course!"
3,"Disappointed, But Helpful",I was disapointed with this Issue -- March 2005 -- as there was in my opinnion an excessive ammount of ads and not a lot of information. However I did find what little information there was -- to be very interesting and worth the read. But it was not enough to fulfil my mind's 'psychological' craving for information.
3,Delivery begins?,I have yet to begin receiving this magazines issues-I ordered this approximately 8-10 weeks ago.
1,Caused a patient to walk out.,The latest Pshycology Today had to be trashed. The clinic treats abused women and incest and rape victims....LUST didn't go over well.
1,Lots of fluff,"If you enjoy magazines like People, that offer you a glimpse of the latest gossip or the newest thingamajig, then click the order button for Psychology Today.As someone who was taking Psych courses as an undergraduate I bought a three-year subscription to PT. As I continued my studies, I began to just toss the magazine away as it would arrive. There is no real substance here for my interest.The magazine offers great topics but just didn't seem to follow through. Most of the time I was able to guess what the overall article would be like after reading the title. New information was rarely offered that wasn't 'common knowledge'."
3,Psychology/Psychobabble,"I'm a long-time reader of PT--I just read Aaron Knoll's review. I must agree in many respects. Since Daniel Goleman left the editorship of PT, it seems to me to have slid continually away from sound, scientific (insofar as the Art of Psychology can go), in the direction of the trendy, dare I say, Aquarian approach to life. There isn't really a substitute for the magazine, so I'd certainly like to see it become a little less like Soap Opera Digest. (I'm about to renew my subsceiption though!)"
4,Hip Psychology,"Before buying a subscription to this magazine I would suggest reading through an issue first, just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. No, it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking, and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read."
4,Easy reading for those interested in psychology,"I'm not a psychology student, and at this time, I don't plan on becoming one. For now, I'm a 25-year-old with a history of depression and OCD and I consider myself a bit of an autodidact. I have taken a few psychology classes in the past and I've also been known to read psych textbooks for ""fun"".Psychology Today is certainly not a textbook and it's definitely made to appeal to Average Joe, which I think it does wonderfully. The articles are informative and interesting, but not too in depth. For me, it's a good way to find out about new ideas and then go and look up more information if I so desire.If you're looking for a textbook, visit your local collegiate bookstore. If you're looking for an easy-reading source for good information to serve as a stepping stone to further studies, Psychology Today is a great place to start."
4,all ways enjoy,Most of the articles are interesting & more or less on my level of understanding. Always does a good job.
2,Watered-down pop psychology for the uneducated masses,"This magazine is strictly for laymen/newbies...on top of that, I've seen some really questionable pseudoscience published in its issues over the last few years, in particular bigoted babble about certain racial features being more attractive than others and other stuff that vaguely stinks of eugenic/sexist nonsense. Hopefully they've managed to purge some of those more noxious notions from their ranks."
4,Psychology Today,"Psychology Today is a gift for my daughter who has a degree in Psychology. She is very pleased with the magazine, and has received the first copy.Before I ordered the subscription, I looked at 3 or 4 different sites on line before ordering the magazine from Amazon.com.That is the only way to order subscriptions.Agnes"
4,Psychology Today,"Psychology Today has been around for years though the format has changed somewhat. I was pleased I didn't have to wait six months to get my first issue. This magazine helps keep people who are generally interested in everyday psychology to stay informed, review what is happening with reviews of new studies and fun with some quirks in psychology the average person questions.I have always enjoyed the magazine for a quick review of ""whats happening"" in general and what the future may have to offer as well as short articles and or stories in the therapuetic world."
4,Intellectualy Fun,I have been getting the magazing for a few years. There always seems to be someithng thought provoking in every issue. If you enjoy psychology issues and topics. It hits the spot.
4,One of the best films about this classic.,"I want to compare CBS version with other film versions I saw:Oliver Twist 1933 One of the first versions. Too brief, but a regular edition, even it was very deteriorated by the time.Oliver Twist 1945 One of the best version with Barrymore.Oliver Twist (Disney Version) Too dark, images have too shadows. Regular version, Faggin was not the best characterization as other versions.Oliver! This Musical was one triumph! Carol Reed was the Director won an Oscar, the film too, and other nominations.The Music was excellent. The characterization of Faggin, one of the best ever.Oliver Twist 2005 - To be seen and reviewed soon."
4,Very good... just a bit drawn out at times.,"Very good rendition... a few segments are a bit drawn out at times... and a number of the shots are very dark (lighting)... I guess to simulate the pre-electric point in time. Made it difficult to ""see"" some of the details in the scenes though. Well worth the sale price that I was able to obtain."
4,Fun while it lasted,"We do had issues with the toy's construction. After 3 days, the shooting mechanism in one gun broke, so the marbles just flow out without shooting. I mentioned it to a friend who said that his kid's Crossfire also broke in the same way. Those little metal wires they use as a springing mechanism just don't last / stay put. It could be a fun game, but the shoddy construction is really prohibitive here."
5,Pow!,Shoot the little metel bulets across the board to shoot the pieces into your oppents zone. reload before you run out of bullets or you won't have anything to block the pieces from coming into your zone. A very fun game!
2,Never had a chance to play.,"Crossfire was at the top of my son's list for Christmas. I went to several different stores and drove 65 miles south and north of our hometown to find this toy. I was very happy to finally find it 60 miles from home after looking in a dozen toy stores. The look on my son's face was priceless on Christmas morning when he opened his gift. His eyes lit up and his smile was from ear to ear!! After anxiously waiting for us to assemble the gameboard, he was quickly saddened when the firing mechanism in one of the guns was not working. The marbles pop up and fall back into the players own side of the board. I have looked for an address to request a replacement part and have been unsuccessful. After all the searching and waiting, he never had a chance to play the game. It is now setting in the closet as I search once again to get a replacement gun."
3,Crossfire toy,"After reading several reviews of this toy, there is no way I would buy it. The materials used are shoddy & cheap;not the durable kind of material needed for a child's toy. Also, as one reviewer stated,it's possible for the guns to be removed and used to fire any where. There is a real and potential danger to a toy such as this. Until the guns can be permanently fixed to the game board so that they can't ever be removed, I will not be buying this for my children. Addtionally, as another reviewer stated, the playing surface is made of a flimsy material which could easily warp and give way. It's a shame this toy is not as well made now as it was originally many years ago."
1,Worst Game Ever!,"I have no idea what any of these morons are thinking! I am a professional board game critic and I've thoroughly investigated every aspect of this game.Fun: NONE AT ALL! What is the point of this game? It's a really bad game. I mean, how on earth is one supposed to have fun launching a steel ball torwards a plastic disc? This question has kept me up late at night. Also, there were no assembly instructions included. So, of course, it took me four hours to sift through the gaunlet of plastic pieces and jam them together into something that resembled the box. And, where are those half-fingered gloves like in the commercials?Educational Value: Ohhhhh pleeeaaaase! I learned nothing from this product except that splashing around in a toliet bowl is more fun.Durability: What in God's name is that supposed to mean? All this highly lame piece of junk showed that it could not be crafted skillfully because it is made with a LAME-O cardboad playing surface...Overall Grade: F-"
3,Not the same game...,"I bought this for my daughter last Christmas after remembering how much I loved it as a child in the 70's. It's ok, but not the same game as back then. They have made the board much shorter, and the guns are a much cheaper plastic material. The main difference is the board material. I believe the original had a hard plastic bottom you shot across. This one is some kind of cardboard, not very good in my opinion. I have to admit, my daughter and her friends enjoy it. It's ok, just don't expect the original."
5,"It's fun to play with & durable but, it is not educational.",It's one of my child's favorite games and sometimes I even play
1,"Hard plastic, not soft at all","These are very hard plastic, they do not bend, there is nothing ""soft"" about these items.I replaced my spring type door stops with these, three days later I put the springs back.When you bump your foot against the hard plastic, it hurts, the springs would just bend.When the baby steps on the hard plastic, it rips out of the wall, the springs would just bend.I just superglued the white caps on the springs."
4,Does not fit 2011 Sienna,"Does NOT fit the 2011 Sienna. The ""make sure it fits"" applet on Amazon has it wrong. I checked the manufacturer's web site and they have the wrong info too. I called the manufacturer and verified that 192131 does not fit the 2011 Sienna. They currently don't make an in-channel one for the 2011 Sienna. Otherwise, it looks like a half decent product."
4,Nice,This album was pretty good. I like her better wit SWV tho but this album was hot. Especially Sunshine & Aint feelin u.
2,I MISS SWV,"Sorry, but i wasn't impressed very much with this cd. After SWV broke up and i heard that Koko had a solo cd out, i eagerly awaited this solo project. After all, her voice dominated SWV and i enjoyed her singing when she was in that group. Koko's cd didn't live up to my expectations at all. I thought this was going to be at least as good as the material she put out when she was in SWV, or even better. I gave it one listen and ended up selling it. The songs are bland and many of the ballads are boring. And there are way too many ballads. Sorry, Koko, you missed the mark. What could have been a knockout project fizzled and turned lukewarm. You were hotter when you were with SWV. Going solo always doesn't guarantee a hit."
5,"COKO IS ""HOT""","THis album displays TRUE R&B... if you like Mary, Faith... or just tight azz R&B, ""Hot Coko"" is the way to go. ""Tryna Come"", ""Sunshine"", ""You And Me"", ""Bigger Than We"" & ""Everytime"" are my jamz... I love this album. ""Triflin'""f/EVE is her next single... go check it out!"
5,This is my shiznit!!!,"I love every song on this album... ""Everytime"" is my favorite, but I always seem to find myself bumpin ""Sunshine"", ""You And Me"" & ""Tryna Come Home"". I love it! She is my MAMA in this music bizz. her vocal stylings, her class, her attitude.. she's a positive roll model for our beautiful black women (which I hope I can snagg before the years out!!) RCA is sleeping on this talent. I hope they have something in store for Coko!! I really do."
4,"You better recognize -- it's COKO! None of this ""cocoa""!","Let me just say that since separating from the great SWV, COKO has just gotten better. God has certainly blessed COKO as she ""continues on her journey alone."" Straight up off the hook, this joint is so tight it hurts! I'll drink this cup of HOT COKO even if it burns my taste buds off and I can't taste anything for the rest of my life, even if that means I won't ever be able to eat cheese ravioli again!"
3,"""Hot Coko:"" A fan's review...","When I first heard that Coko was releasing her first solo record I was very excited. I didn't know what to expect, and what I got was really suprising. There are several tracks on the album that showcase those beautiful pipes. Songs like ""Tryna To Come Home,"" ""I Ain't Feelin' You,"" and ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye"" have powerhouse, diva like vocals on them. I wish though she would have put more adult tracks on the album, but overall it's a great mix of urban r&b. Look out Monica, Brandy, Mya, Deborah, Tamia, and even Faith. Next time around I'm expectnig even bigger things from this smooth crooner."
3,Hot Coko is only warm,"thought Coko might want to distinguish herself from the ""SWV"" sound and really heat up on her own. The production is very formulaic and she does nothing to differentiate herself from the other ""girl"" R&B singers and her name alone should have been enough to start that. the material is just weak. The duet with Tyrese might have been better had they chose their own direction and not tried to replicate the style of Luther and Cheryl Lynn's version, a version which is untouchable. In conclusion, her vocals haven't changed much either -- same off pitch soprano on the verge of shouting. he voice is best when she sings in a slightly lower register."
4,beautiful,"im so glad i got the chance to hear coko preform alone and express her own feelings on her solo album,i would recomend this album for anyone who enjoys to hear a destinct voice of a woman like no voice ever heard, i recomend this album its the bomb."
5,Hot Coko is Right.....The album is hot.,"This new one from Coko is nothing less of hot. For her first solo cd this is good. I think all fans of SWV will like it and non-fans too. She carried the group most of the time since she was lead singer anyway but this time shes more in control over what she is doing. The hot tracks r: Try-na come home, trifling,......just every track. So get up and get some Hot Coko while it's hot!!!!"
4,Hot Coko,"This truly is a beautiful album. Coko does not stray far from that SWV sound that we have all grown to love. From up-beat jams such as ""I Ain't Feelin' You"" to down-tempo ballads such as ""If This World Were Mine"", ""Hot Coko"" (cleverly named no-less) really brings out Coko's talent, not only as a singer, but as a writer as well. Stand out tracks include the first single released from this album ""Sunshine"" and the 2nd single ""Triflin'"" featuring Eve. If you love SWV or even if you don't, this is a must have!"
4,No one can touch Coko!!!,"Ever since I heard her sing live with SWV on the billboard awards back in 93/94 I have always said that this girl can SANG!Hot Coko is everything I hoped it would be. Bigger Than We shows a more socially conscience Coko with a beautiful song. The string arrangement at the end of the song is UNBELIEVABLe! When she sings that final ""..inSPITE of the obsTAcles!!!"" I nearly faint every time! She can belt so high its incredible!I see from other reviews that everyone else also agrees that if there's any justice TRiflin' HAS to be the next single.It's got attitude and a kickin vocal from my girl, Coko.Finally, I have to say I love If this World Were Mine. The harmonies and riffs that Coko does at the end are worth the price of the CD!!Coko, you are the best!!"
5,I'm listening to it right now!,"I have alway liked Coko since SWV's first CD. She has a very gospel voice. When I saw her on Soul Train she stated that she was working on a gospel album. I can not wait until it comes out. I like all of the songs on the CD. I am currently listening to Sunshine, which happens to be one of my favorite songs. Boy can she sing!"
3,brown flats,"Nice looking shoe. Would have been better with 1/2 inch more heel on it. Nice constructed, though."
5,A major revelation about the past & future of man.,"WAR IN HEAVEN, goes into more detail than the Author's previous book ""IS THE HOLY BIBLE AN EXTRATERRESTIAL TRANSMISSION?"" For those that enjoyed C.L. Turnages first book, there are things here that the reader will appreciate. The books content is littered with many facts & theories about are past & future. What is the most revealing piece in the book is Marduk's promise to rebuild & return to Babylon in IRAQ. Also is Marduks jealous battles with Yahweh. So where does Saddam Hussein fit in? For those answers read this book. If Zecharia Sitchin's book THE COSMIC CODE, was dissappointing, then you must read this book. Ther are surprises & mystery here.For many this book will be difficult to read all at one time.The reader must take their time & grasp evey word & footnote in this book. A diffinative piece de resistance. Therefore higly recommended, and not for the easily frightened. A must read for the future."
2,If Zecharia Sitchin were Fundamentalist Christian,"Two stars for its comedic paranoid ramblings. Sitchin's translations of the Sumerian clay tablets have opened the way for a more plausible creation theory that sparked interest in many folks to reread the Bible with a new perspective. This book incorporates much of the ancient Sumerians' cosmology with a decidedly fundamentalist Christian perspective to give a very unusual theory. For example, the author reveals the God of the Old Testament Bible to be Nannar-Sin with Marduk as the ""anti-christ"" who plans, with the assistance of Saddam Hussein, to ressurect King Nebuchadnezzar in the final days. She also reveals, ""Those who die receive eternal life on (planet) Nibiru."" The notions here are entertainingly wacky but much is written here to polarize and promote unhealthy paranoia. Worth reading just to get a glimpse of a new type of religious nut we may all have to contend with."
2,tight thighs,"this pant is made tight on the thigh so if you are athletic thighs than don't buy it! but for skinny people, it's great \"
4,"For the price, you can't beat it.....","Definitely a buy for $12.98 but the fit is not for everyone. Low rise, and cut small through the hips and thighs. I ordered my regular size (29x34) and they fit fine. Material is a bit thin but aren't all of the ""trendy"" jeans lately? If they ever reappear here, I wil buy more..."
5,Will Still Be Read in the 22nd Century,"My approach to reading the two Red Wheel volumes has not been ideal, since I read each when it was first avaiable in English translation. The 25 year separation between the two ""knots"" was not ideal for me as a reader, but then the circumstances faced by the author have never been ideal. The second knot, November 1916, will reward your reading efforts with a recreation of the Great War's Eastern front, and of the unfolding disaster in the Russian heartland, that cannot be found elsewhere. Since the horrors in the process of being unleashed in the month captured here by Solzhenitsyn have not yet run their full course, one cannot, even as late as the year 2003, assess the full damage. But this novel lets us glimpse, and perhaps understand, the beginning of a nightmare--for a great people and for all of humanity."
1,Not just economical but CHEAP,"This crusher is made very cheap. After crushing only one bag of cans, the handle detached from the holding pin. I've used 'cold weld' material to fix it twice and it broke again. I'm shopping for a new sturdier one now. I'd recommend not buying this one."
5,"Great Graphics, Much Fun!","Nephews and I had Maximo ""Ghost to Glory"", but was lost. We enjoyed the challenging levels, bosses and very nice touch to the graphics, so I checked Amazon and found the first Maximo and happily discovered the Second in the series- Maximo vs. ""Army of Zin"" I was thrilled to see it for sale by one Amazon vendor and purchased it as well. As in the first game, ""Army of Zin"" is packed with fun graphics and continues the tale of the lead character's challenge now along with Grim with more weapons and cool power-ups battle an army of Ghouls to save the villagers!"
5,As difficult as it is addictive,"This game is the great grandson of the old ""Ghosts & Goblins"" series. It's has more old-school combat action than your typical platformer. Some may find this game difficult or repetitive. Not me. I enjoy this game because of the challenge. In general, it has great graphics and smooth gameplay."
5,Do your kids love reptiles?,"This is a great subscription for those animal loving kids, and adult enthusiasts. I have renewed my subscription every year for our son since he was 8. Interestingly my son grew up to become a reptile breeder and this is STILL on his wishlist every year. You never outgrow cool and interesting."
5,Exotic and domestic,"I'm in agreement with other reviewers that the magazine does tend to focus too much on exotic species, from the Galapagos Islands to Madagascar; but, for the most part, I found this to be tempered by many very helpful articles for the average herp owner. I have 2 boas, some chameleons, an iguana, and a python--and I believe that ""Reptiles"" focus on all reptiles has given me a better understanding of my own. This isn't necessarily geared 100% toward the pet owner, but more for the overall enthusiast."
2,"Not bad, when I recieve any in mail?","I have had the same problem that a previous reviewer said. I have had a Reptiles magazine subscription a few years back and a current one. The previous order had a missing issue and my subscription was not extended. Now my most recent has annoyed me. I recieved three issues, and then no more isues. Even though the Reptiles mag site says I should have recieved at least two issues since then, and I got a supposed extension. After this subscription, no more. I'll do as I have in the past, purchase them as I see them and only if the subjects interest me. So the warning is that this magazine can be unreliable."
1,It might have been worth it?,"I received two issues, then nothing. I can only give it one star, as I haven't had the opportunity to read it! I would have liked to actually read the years worth of magazines that I paid for."
5,"Great magazine, nice pictures","This is a good magazine if you are curious about reptiles and amphibians. It has lovely pictures, and the contents, although scientifically rigorous, are accessible to any reader. It is a nice leisure reading."
4,"""EMI"" Reptiles Magazine","I like this magazine but..It does not have alot of information.I would like to add that this magazine does not just cater to younger people.I am 13 and i do not like it when people say"" it has stupid little puzzles you know stuff that only kids would enjoy"".I am sure that most kids that get this magazine are smarter than that anyway (but i do not like the puzzles either)including me,Future Zoologist."
2,This Magazine Stinks,"This magazine caters to a younger audience. Don't subscribe if you want in-depth, detailed information regarding Reptiles. The layout and design is playful and childish, and the content is thin. It's obvious the editors are hurting for content because they allow even the smallest story to consume an entire page.Plus, the goofy cartoons and silly ""games"" are just annoying. Too bad the Vivarium isn't available."
4,Good but not so helpful,"I would give this dvd 5 stars because Shawn goes through each dance in such detail so you have no problem learning. The only thing is, when I go out to do line dancing, the dances were totally different!! I later came to find out that every ""country"" club has different dances.. even if it's a few steps that are changed up."
1,"you're not gonna like this, and neither will your kids",this is predictable. there is no variation as to when the potato will buzz. we played with it a couple of times. even tried it at a party. four thumbs down.
3,It's Online Now,I'm not rating it for stars. But I'll tell you it's on the PFP database page - for now. So you can download it in pdf format.
4,A New Page-Turner,"If you like international intrigue and slick operations, this is for you. All I ask from an adventure book is that the author know his subject and that it make me want to turn the page. Both of these score big-time with me. I really liked it."
3,Not as good as other SEAL stories...,"I've been a longtime reader of books on the SEAL Teams, both fiction and fact. While this book did have some excellent moments and the characters stayed true to themselves, I can only really give it an average grade. The writing didn't truly grab me, and the characters, at times, seemed more like cardboard cutout supermen. At times, they didn't have any depth, and seemed interchangeable with one another.Personally, I would suggest Marcinko's Rogue Warrior and Keith Douglass' Seal Team Seven over this series. Marcinko's stories may be somewhat unbelievable and a bit egotistical, but they're fun. ST7's characters have a bit more depth to them, and do not come across as nigh invulnerable."
1,navy seals insurrection red,I was very disappointed with this book...I believe that the lay out of it was set up good but the events of what was going on was really bad. I was looking for something along the lines of like seal team seven books. But this one was a big waste of time.
2,Dated and slow,"These stories would remain unpublished without Archer's name attached to them. Older writers need to know when to call it quits before dragging out every lame bit of narrative they have laying around the house. To Cut a Long Story short is perfect evidence of the fact that big publishers sell safe, well-know names not stories of true quality. Pity. Most of these are ""based on actual events"" so they are not even original creations of Archer's -- just junk pulled from newspaper headlines and turned into snooze fiction."
2,Very dull indeed,"Surprised by all the good reviews, as I found this very dull and functional writing. None of the stories were overly interesting, clever or engaging. I was expecting a few twists and clever conclusions but was left unmoved by nearly all the stories.I wouldn't recommend this at all."
3,Just another book,"All the stories has their own message, but I can't tell you that is a good reading, if you have another book to read take it and read it, read this one between books (one or two stories) and then another book and may be you will be interested in the stories, as always in these kind of books, you just can skip the last story, is very long and it says almost nothing."
2,Take a rest,"I have enjoyed most of this authors books. In this one he appears to have been writing in his sleep, the old ""get up and grab the reader"" is missing. Perhaps he has too much on his mind with his personal problems. He should take a break, then come back and wow us with his earlier skills."
3,Good but VERY easy reading,"I have enjoyed the stories in this book, but it is very simply written. I blew through the first 150 pages on a short plane trip. I totally can recommend it if you want something brainless and since it is a mass market paperback it is easy to tote around."
1,Skip it.,"Archer has about 3 tricks he likes to use in this book. With 14 stories, this gets old. By then end I was reading the first couple pages and then skipping to the end of the story to read the clever little ending. A very unfulfilling way to read. I just got the feeling that the author found himself to be very clever. With a novel there can be character development and such that will mitigate this fact, but in a short story if the gimick is weak the rest will fail as well. With the exception of ""The Endgame"" I found the stories quite forgettable."
2,Mediocre,"Although mercifully brisk and tightly written, the stories in ""To Cut a Long Story Short"" pivot shamelessly on the dustiest of mystery-genre cliches. One or two tickled my senses, but the balance triggered alarm bells of disappointment and regret."
4,LOVE IT,"The designs in this book are totally outdated (talk about the 80's!), but the commentary in it is valuable for any person who is searching for a way to relate interior design with Christianity. Andersen offered much wisdom on the subject, and left me with new understanding."
2,don't waste your money,"one bit broke after using it about 3 times. another broke on the very first use. junk. i don't know what they are made from, but they are weak."
2,"OK, but not as good as I expected","I grew up in my father's gas station in the early 70s and remember seeing his mechanics using Lisle tools all the time. I also remember seeing them at the NAPA store and knowing they had to be top quality. 40 years later and times have changed. I bought this set so I could remove the bolts holding the gas tank in my car. The sockets are not forged, but pressed together out of 4 pieces of metal. Looking into the drive end of the sockets you can see the gaps between the separate chunks of steel. You cannot put much torque on these cheap sockets or they will fall apart like a cheap watch."
2,Mixed,"An interesting subject matter, but the book is incredibly poorly written and organized given that it was written by a PR professional. It really jumps all over the place with often no background or addressing topics that it is assumed the reader understands even though they are only mentioned much later in the book. Also strange how the author writes himself into the story in the third person. This could have been a much, much better book but it seems the author wrote it more to please the ""hero"" than to objectively tell a story."
2,Not as fun as it could have been.,I only got this because I am an extreme fan of Michael Pare`. At least THAT part was good! Lots of shirtless good looking Michael but that doesn't make up for the content. This is all filmed in one building. Everybody racing around and trying to kill each other. Got pretty darn boring.
2,Not Worth the Money...,"I've never really been a huge Nsync fan, much less a Justin Timberlake fan...but my opinion on this song was not influenced by that! Well, let me just...this songs [is bad]. We've heard it enough on MTV, and he just trys so hard. I mean, the way he dances, the way he sings...sort of remind you of someone...? Well, let me just say, 'Like I Love You' is not really a good song. Since I don't lihe the original song, the remixes wouldn't be good either. Well, that's about it! Hope this helps!"
1,The next failure!,His voice is so terrible and just can't stand his songs! He's just a vain little boy who can't sing and just want to be the next Michael Jackson but fails pretty badly. I would not recommend this album to anyone. F-
2,"Can you say ""Michael Jackson wannabe?""",When I first heard this song I couldn't stand it. The high falsetto totally ruined it for me otherwise it wouldn't be a bad song. Justin Timberlake reminds me of a wannabe Michael Jackson -not very original.
2,No Real useful information,"I work in digital production, and bought this book to get some background info before my interview with Sony Imageworks. Unfortunately, it is just a jumble of too general info and gee-whiz diagrams, that wouldn't be useful to anybody. Production pipelines vary from studio to studio, and are constantly changing. There are interviews with some impressive names, but most of it is this starry-eyed look at the digital future. The stupidest thing is the quote from Francis Ford Coppola ""I knew it would happen all along"". Give me a break! Spend your cash on some magazines like Computer Graphics world for the effects info."
3,It's an OK little magazine,"I haven't found tons of stuff I want to make in it, though, and a some of the patterns that are published in this magazine, I've found for free on the net or as give-aways from yarn & thread companies! So...I don't think I'll subscribe again, but it was a nice little mag to get in the mail."
1,"Poor quality, content and customer service",I somehow got on their mailing list and got sent several past due notices without ever getting a magazine. Did see the magazine and it's not something I would have ever subscribed to - very poor quality and nothing in it that the other better crochet magazines don't already have. The price is also outlandish for the black and white newspaper quality.
1,hard to like something you pay for and do not receive.,I have had other issues of this magazine before so I know I will like it once it starts to come.
3,Questionable Freshness,"Product was shipped promptly and tastes fine. Best tea I've found! But this order had the ""best before"" date removed before shipping. This calls into question whether the product was out of date before being shipped. Also found in local grocery store for about the same cost."
5,Twinings the Original Earl Grey,"Hot or iced this tea is a culinary star. The Bergamot is of high quality and enhances the flavor of this excellent tea. The balance of mildness is spectacular with just the right amount of bitterness and tannins. It also represents an excellent value in comparison to the newer ""boutique"" teas. Highly recommended!"
2,Selling dented cans.,"Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the six boxes of loose tea were received were dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where the tin boxes could be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service."
3,"Best Earl Grey, but a little stale when buying in bulk.","I'm no sure if this tea sits in a warehouse that doesn't turn over product very often or what, but this exact tea (same size & packaging) is consistently fresher when purchased at a grocery store. The difference in price, I've decided, is worth it and will be only buying this tea in person from now on."
5,Perfect tea.,"Well caffeinated, affordable, and the best tasting tea I've ever had. I got turned on to this stuff a couple years ago, when I found a 30-year-old tin of it in a cabinet in my house. The new stuff tastes just as good as the old."
1,Where is the smell?,"I bought this for my closet. But i don't notice any smell at all, unless i get very close to the bags and try to smell it as hard as i can. when i squeeze the bag, some smell come out but no where enough to make my closet smell like lavender."
3,"Loved it at first, but it fades quickly","I LOVE Lavender - however, there is only a slight scent of Lavender, and not enough for Lavender lovers like me."
2,save a tree,"I got this on a free promotion because i bought some sports item here and i thought cool. Turned out it's one, if not the worst magazine i've ever read. I get the feeling it's not much more than a picture layout for people with plenty of cash to entice them into buying more things. I really wanted to rate it one star but somehow those one star reviews somehow lose credibility- i mean how bad can it be? so ok, I'll give it one and a half. Complete garbage, and that's another thing i feel bad about."
1,Too many ads!,"This used to be my favorite magazine, but now it's just ad after ad after ad. I go outside to get away from it all, and I like to read about climbing, biking, hiking, etc., when I have to be inside. All the ads drain the joy from me."
1,"Great magazine, lousy service","So I ordered in March and they tell me I won't receive the magazine until June! I thought in the age of information and technology, my order would pass on through. Instead its some sort of mule carrying my request to the subscription center. Then they have to hand-write my address on each magazine cover... note sarcasm.I can download mp3s and buy an album on the spot, but I can't get a magazine at my door for 3 months?Get it together!! Don't buy it from Amazon!"
3,6 to 10 weeks?!,"I love this magazine, but am disappointed that my magazines will not start arriving for 6 to 10 weeks according to Amazon. If I had known that I would not have used Amazon to purchase my subscription. Very disappointing."
1,Have yet to receive the item,Although I understand the reason I have yet to receive the magazine it is still rather irritating.
5,Outside Magazine,"This magazine is one of the most selected to be read in my dental office, both by men and women"
2,Image vs. Content,"I'm not sure who's at the helm of this operation but I'd be willing to bet they don't get Outside too often. Not to be too cynical about it, but I just don't find this mag to be as USEFUL as it was before. If you like LOTS of articles on who the coolest extreme sports stars are, how they got their abs, and what gear they're wearing, subscribe NOW. The magazine looks amazing, the photography is top notch and they still manage to come up with a thorny article on the environment periodically. But for my money, it just feels like the editorial staff has been plucked from New York image mags that do one thing really well - SELL. I read National Geographic Adventure, and unlike Outside, I USE IT for information because it has CONTENT."
1,Is this Men's Journal...,"... or any other corporatized magazine. I've read Outside for several years now, and it's become just another glorified catalog to sell stuff with shallow writing: e.g. best Tequilas in Mexico, etc, etc. I used to enjoy this magazine when it contained incisive writing from John Krakauer and others, and it was about the outdoors. Now it's basically corporate drivel. If I covered the title it could be Men's Journal or any such mag. I imagine that these editors must go from place to place taking their homogeneity and dull corporate editorial skills with them. This will be the last year that I read it."
3,An Outdoor Magazine for the Armchair SUV Set,"There is some very good writing to be found in Outdoor- Randy Wayne White and John Krakauer come immediately to mind. Excellent reading for the armchair traveller. The bulk of the magazine, however, is an extended advertisement for high-tech outdoors gear, punctuated by ads for SUVs the size of earthmoving equipment that every true outdoorsman or woman needs.Outdoors is rather like the numerous amateur photography magazines that obsess about equipment and yet have very little to say about the aestheic of art. When I think of my favorite outdoor adventures I don't think about the equipment I used, or the many and wonderful modern conveniences I brought along. Instead I think of just being in a quiet place, away from flashing and beeping electronics that fill my workday."
3,Fine for guys,"I'm not sure what has happened at Outside, but for the past couple of years it seems like it wants to be Esquire. Though not founded as a men's magazine, it's become that. Case in point: The most recent gift guide, which is titled """"What Every Man Wants This Year."" Apparently it was too hard to find gifts women would like.The photography is astounding, but overall you're better off going with the real thing: Subscribe to Esquire."
2,Like a dumber lamer GQ with more patagonia,"Outside used to be a pretty interesting magazine, but somehow turned into a totally dumb men's mag about dumb stuff. I guess they think only vapid shallow wealthy men enjoy the outdoors? boooring."
3,GOING DOWN HILL...,"The main complaint in the critical reviews is that OUTSIDE has lost it's formerly excellent articles and substance. THEY ARE CORRECT. This was a great magazine that is quickly ""losing"" it."
1,Outside - rename it Couch Potato,"This was for many years the best outdoor and travel magazine available. Sadly it has lost it's direction, the content is now very variable and in my opinion frequently has hidden left wing political messages. I think that the Editorial Board should take responsibility for the demise of a great magazine and resign. Finally given the change in content Outside needs to be renamed ""Couch Potato"""
1,Too many Male-Oriented Photos are disappointing,"Loved the magazine, but after two years of it, the onslaught of mostly bare-chested men both in the mag and on the cover was too much. Where are the women? If it is targeting the gay audience, please say so. Each month, I'd count the number of men vs. women photos and there are very few women. Just unshaven boys. Not my cup of tea, so my subscription hasn't been renewed."
4,fun when I was young--fun now with my children,Our family played this game a lot during the 60's. We had a blast with it. I didn't think much about it until this year when my son turned 6. It's a blast for family fun!
2,FUN GAME- CHEAP PLASTIC,"THE GAME ITSELF IS FUN TO PLAY HOWEVER, THE PLASTIC CENTER WITH HANDS IS CHEAPLY-MADE, ""CHINTZY"", OF COURSE, I'M COMPARING IT TO THE SAME PIECE 35 YRS AGO WHICH WAS OF MUCH BETTER QUALITY!"
3,Hands Down,"Kids love to play this game. It does help develop hand/eye coordination, reaction time, competitiveness, and happiness. The price is good for the quality of the build."
1,What book?,"It would be great to review this book; however I never received it. The person I purchased it for is still undergoing treatment, but no matter she will live on with out it."
2,Not her best,I found this book boring and very hard to read. I took me a long time to finish. I don't really see what the title has to do with the book. I would not recommend this. Ending was bad.
5,Definitely No Sugar Coating and I Loved It!,It is very rare that a fictional piece moves me emotionally and this is one that made me lose all inhibitions. The characters were developed in a way that you could not help but to feel their presence. You feel as if you are right there experiencing the sometimes tragic nature of relationships through their eyes at a time when life in general was complicated for African Americans. The added stress of complicated love pushes this plot beyond measure. The author does a great job creating twists and turns through a dynamic plot unlike any I have ever read. Roberta is a protagonist unlike any other going great lengths to win the love of someone she should have never had. Her character is one you definitely will never forget. This book had an everlasting effect on me and is definitely a must read.
4,SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED,"As I read some of the other reviews, I realized that I'm not the only one who was disappointed on how this book ended. It seems like the story was cut short for some reason. I was expecting her to elaborate more on Roberta. What happend to her children after she was institutionalized. It seems like she was in a race against time. Who knows. Maybe she had to meet a deadline. Hey, can't be perfect all the time. So far, I've read all of J.D.'s books and look forward to reading more of her books in the future."
5,An introduction to Abba's music,"There are a few big UK hits here - Waterloo, Gimmie gimmie gimmie, SOS, The name of the game and Lay all your love on me - but this is not (and does not pretend to be) a greatest hits collection. There are other compilations available (at a higher price) that fulfil that purpose.Among the other tracks, originally released on various albums, my favorites here are Rock me, Gonna sing you my love song, When I kissed the teacher, Why did it have to be me and the minor UK hit, Ring ring.With sixteen tracks at a budget price, this collection offers a selection of hits and album tracks that will appeal to those who don't want (or can't afford) to spend much money on Abba. It is not meant for the serious Abba collector, who will end up buying all the tracks elsewhere, although there are a few die-hards who must have every compilation."
4,Fun to watch; a movie for the whole family,"So it is corny. Beautiful woman parts with lover, thinks he has died, gets pressed into a marriage of convenience and guess who showes up, a month before the wedding? Normally these stories are all the same, but this time it has been given a new impetus. A lot of action ( excellent fencing ), humor and even a bit of a plot, but most of all an excellent cast obviously enjoying themselves make this a pleausure to see. Don't watch the Princess Bride if you are looking for literature in the movies, but if you want to show the children a 'grown-up' movie, that you can even enjoy yourself, then this is an excellent choice"
3,"A decent flick, but the book was MUCH better!","About ten years ago, I used to watch this movie CONSTANTLY. Then I promptly forgot about it. About two years ago, I bought William Goldman's abridged version of the book, and loved it to death. I still read it at least once a week. What I'd like to know is WHY did they take out all of the good parts of the book when they decided to make the movie? There are so many deliciously great parts of the book that were totally cut from the movie, or even just a few lines missing. I understand that they need to make the book fit into a couple of hours, but come on! This is one of the greatest movies ever...if you haven't read the book."
4,A classic!,"Good movie. I thought my grandkids would like it, as my granddaughters LOVE anything princess, but some of the scenes are a little too scary for small children, and may cause nightmares."
5,Everything I expected it to be,"The movie showed up earlier than expected, the quality was perfect Blu-ray. Took me all of about 4 hours after it was delivered to open it up and watch it. Packing was good and it works perfectly.Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father, prepare to die."
5,Anybody Want a Peanut?,"Okay, I love this movie. I really, really love this movie. Somehow it manages to both make fun of fairy tales and make you love fairy tales all the more. The dialogue is absolutely wonderful. I can quote this movie practically word for word and I never get tired of seeing it.I have read the book, and it was HUGE disappointment. It was much more bitter and satirical and didn't have the clean, innocent dumbness of the movie. So my advice would be to skip the book and head to Blockbuster's."
1,Noisy video quality,This is the worst looking Blue Ray I have ever seen. VERY noisy picture quality. The DVD looks better on my Blue Ray player. I am very disappointed as I love this movie.
1,AWFUL BLU RAY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For those of you who remember watching VHS movies, imagine a tape that has reached the end of its life and is being played through a tv with a loose coaxial cable connection. That's what this Blu Ray release reminded me of. It is absurdly grainy and is almost unwatchable (particularly if you have a big screen TV that allows you to see all the flaws--I watched this on an 82 inch). Sure, the detail is better in some spots, but overall I think it would be much better watching the upconverted DVD. If you're wondering whether you should get the Blu Ray, think again."
5,Is there a better movie than this?,"I bought this DVD after realizing I hadn't seen the film in years. When I watched it, I realized I remembered about 90% of the dialogue. Eminently quotable, totally enjoyable! Is there anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie? There shouldn't be!"
4,A Lot of Fun!,"This is a satirical farce in the tradition of ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Time Bandits"" ""Baron Von Munchausen"", ""The Labyrinth"", and the ilk. It's funny, adventurous, action-filled and thoroughly enjoyable. The kids will like the story, and the adults will like the witticisms - both obvious and oblique. Definitely worth a rent, and to me it's worth owning! Doesn't rate 5 stars because, IMHO, only serious, important works such as ""The Color Purple"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Twelve Angry Men"" deserve such distinction."
4,What a good movie,"This is a good movie, but I'm that type of person that likes to give movie reviwes and this is a great movie. so to the review, this is a good movie but there is some false words, and there is one scene that he is on some sort of life sucking Torture machine.well I can't spoill the movie all in all it's a good movie.Thanks, and I hope you buy this great movie.if you need more movie reviews E-mail me"
5,This movie rocks!!!!!,"A movie of a thousand quotes, The Princess Bride captivates,while gently amusing viewers. Extremely worth your while to watch and be enraptured by its gentle romanticity, but more impressivly, humourous satirical wit. Truly the brain child of a mastermind. INIGO U R THE MAN!!!!!!"
4,Great Movie,"This movie is fun and entertaining for both younger audiences and their more adult counterparts. The adventure flows freely, in true swashbuckling form, and the laughs never stop. Brilliant performances by Peter Faulk, Robin Wright, and Cary Elwes lead a truly spectacular rogue's gallery of supporting roles and cameos that you'll never forget. If you like action in the vein of pirates or robin hood, you'll enjoy this movie, but the VHS may be a better buy for your buck."
3,fun and exciting,i only remember that the story is like the fairy tales . but it is clean and safe for kids.
3,"Excellent movie, poor DVD","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, so obviously, I had to get the DVD. But upon reading the reviews for it, I decided to wait until I could get a good deal on a used copy, and feel that I definitely made the right decision. This disc does absolutely nothing to take advantage of the DVD standard, and shows us nothing but the movie itself and a trailer. There are no extras, not even English subtitles (instead, it uses vastly inferior closed captioning). No interviews, no commentary, no making-of documentary, no outtakes. Basically, it offers nothing that a widescreen VHS copy or Laserdisc copy offers, except for better quality than the VHS copy.The movie gets 5 stars, absolutely! The DVD gets 1 star, because it's a poorly done release. So the over all release gets 3 stars from me.Note that this review is NOT for the Special Edition DVD, which improves on the initial version greatly."
