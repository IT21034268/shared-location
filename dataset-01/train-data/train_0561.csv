1,5 Stars? Are You Kidding?,"Yes, it's true, if your child likes Caillou, he or she probably will like this CD. But, as a parent, I found this music unbearable! ""Caillou"" sings every one of these songs in that high-pitched, baby-talk voice he speaks with on the show. I was expecting this CD to contain some of the great songs sung by the real kids that the show features, but I was in for an awful surprise. I'm just glad I borrowed it from the library before I made a purchase I would have regretted. Make sure you listen to the sample tracks before buying this one!"
3,Join the Caravan...,"...and enjoy some good, bare-bones, heavy music. This is the first album I've heard by these guys. I enjoyed most of the slower tracks, particularly ""Black Flower"" and ""Futility's Reasons"". Unfortunately, when they speed things up a bit they sound a little too much like Motorhead for my liking. I'm sure that I'll enjoy exploring their other offerings, too. Certainly worth a listen if you enjoy the genre."
2,Not as good,The 5th season was way to political and was not very funny ..if your going to make a comedy let it be funny ..leave politics out ..I sold this season after looking at it ..I like the first 4 seasons ..not going to get anymore
2,Designing Women Season 5 packaged differently than all the others?,Designing Women: The Complete Fifth SeasonReceived Season 5 of Designing women today. I have seasons 1-4 so I noticed right away that it was just in a plastic case. No cardboard cover like seasons one thru four have. No nice colored coordinated sleeve that looks good on your DVD shelf. Just the plastic case. Disappointed and will not get any future season sets.
5,LOVE IT,I'm so glad that they have all of this ICONIC show available on DVD. I have enjoyed each and EVERY episode so far!!
5,My favorite show,"I love the first 5 seasons of Designing Women. The humor still holds up for me. It is probably my all time favorite searies because of the smart, witty dialogue. I can identify a little with each character. I love shows about smart, assertive, empowered funny women!"
5,BEST MOVIE OR BEST MOVE?,"Forget the Godfather, Wisely's Tales is by far the best movie released in the past 100 years. Everything fails in comparison. Wisely made me quit my job and search for the true Santa's of this world. Its truly an eye opening experience that will have you laughing, crying, and WTFing nearly the entire time you're watching it. Its truly an experience everyone needs to see for themselves.11/10 stars!"
5,Cool,My mom gave me and my sister an early christmas present. This video is really cool. My favrite one is mousel he is funny. The other animals are really cool to. I saw it 6 times already.
2,A Christmas Adventure...From a Book Called Wisely's Tales,"The quality of the movie is not bad, althought the story is ok. The story title looks like great for holiday, but certain parts of story is harsh for younger kids, as a kingergarden teacher, personally I don't recommend this for younger kids. The story seems lack of heart and warmth which is important for the holiday."
4,Great book - but was it edited?,"This is a great book for people beginning to learn SQL Server. There are many step by step examples of how to use, maintain, manage and program SQL Server. However, I don't think this book or it's examples were edited. THERE ARE MANY ERRORS IN THIS BOOK, mainly in program syntax (which are easy to fix if you know SQL). If they could come out with a second (edited) edition, this book could get 5 stars."
4,strange familiar,"This is a very pleasant disc that sounds so familiar and sounds like so many other things, like Costes and Air to name a few. I agree with the other reviewer about the 1968 Vespa reference. The more I listen to this the more I love it. It is a breathe of fresh air, very calm and perfect for a garden party. My favorite song is ""girls and maths,"" ""she's wearing out my polo shirt, the blue one with the....."" it is very fun stuff indeed. Not for everyone due to the mellowness of the whole trip to the 60's and back but for those who love simple things, dig in deep."
4,Return of dane,"Dana is back after a few years out of action. He used to have a few good songs back in the 80's to the start of the 90's which put him on level. Now he is back again with some newer beats which are sounding nice, good production. He is keeping it real and not rapping about murdering and starting trouble, in the way that if it happens, it happens, just be prepared aswel as real life experiences which is more real than pretending you are untouchable and hard when no one is. Altogether, this is a good album and dana deserves respect since he is oldschool too and was there when things were warming up. So, pick it up if you wandering. Definately good. Peace!"
3,Story telling king,Dana Dane is known for his story telling style of rap. He doesn't disappoint and his style is much different from any other rappers from the late 80's and 90's. He has a very unique flow and style that most people love. Highly recommend this.
2,"Not a bad option, not a great one either.","The shoe looks sharp, but is lacking in comfort. As for the ""leather"", it is more ""kind of leather looking."" If looking for a similar shoe again, I would spend a little more and get something more comfortable with a higher quality leather."
2,Cheap feelings for Cheap shoes,"What can I say? You get what you pay for. Took me two weeks to break these in and they still feel too small. Bought som Allen Edmonds later, what a difference. Consider yourself warned."
2,Not Impressed,Did not meet my expectations for the price paid. Could have purchased a better one from a nearby store. The image provided looks more like a photoshoped image.
1,Ouch!,"These shoes have never fit right. I have had them professionally stretched and my cobbler says there is no way these are a 5E. I've never worn them for more than an hour -- because they hurt so much -- but figured after having them stretched Amazon probably wouldn't entertain the idea of returning. If there is an Amazon person monitoring this, and you think you can help, please let me know. I'd be happy to buy the other shoes again as a return -- even though the cost was nearly double."
3,Look Nice,"While they look nice and are light weight, the length seems to be off between the left & right shoes. Left shoe fits nicely, but the right is cramped for my big toe, even though there is plenty of room in the toe box for the rest of my toes. Have not had a problem like this with any other shoes."
2,Great shoe but size seemed to be mislabeled,"This is an excellent high quality shoe made by Florsheim. I have successfully worn their 5 E width shoes in the past. Although the shoe I received was labeled 5 E in width on both the box and the shoe, I do not believe that was, in fact, the actual size. I believe that a 3 E shoe had been incorrectly mislabeled as a 5 E and that is what I had received. However, Amazon made the return process very easy."
5,Another great deal through Amazon,"I am 60 years old and have been wearing Florsheim shoes since I was big enough to fit into them. They have always been wonderful shoes and these are no exception. I always feel good when I wear Florsheim Shoes as they just don't come any nicer looking and they make my feet happy. Comfort, always there, dress shoe-yes, but tough and it is true that people always notice your shoes. Can't do better than these! Thanks Amazon for making another on line purchase a great experience."
3,Good account of events,"Halberstam does an effective job of recounting the happenings in the Balkans, but his account of domestic affairs is a little left leaning. He gushes over Clinton's political abilities contrasting them with GHW Bush who he thinks just didn't understand America after the cold war. The account of the Clinton foreign policy (or lack of one) is even handed and he made me want to meet Richard Holbrook who comes across as a skilled negotiator and shrewd politician.A couple omissions and some of the wording are a little left of center or at least a little less than objective when comparing and contrasting the two parties. He recounts Clinton's victories in both elections without mentioning Perot at all. He also refers to those that led the Republican trouncing in '94 as ""religious fundamentalists"" and ""zealots"".All in all a pretty good book, just ignore the partisan lean."
4,The Strange World of Foreign Policy and Politics,"David Halberstam's War in a Time of Peace is a massive look at American foregin policy in the 1990s, through the presidencies of Bush and Clinton. Bosnia and Kosovo are the centerpieces but the book also touches meaningfully on Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti. The thumbnail biographical portraits of all the leading American figures is a great joy and asset of this book. Foreign policy can be a confusing issue, not least of all because of its lack of intelligible coverage in the media or on campaign trails. Halberstam makes all these complex issues and myriad personalities shine through clearly. His critiques of the media are particularly important and compelling and this book is a refreshing antidote to the sort of journalism television has thrust to the fore. This is a valuable book but, most of all, it is a enjoyable and fascinating read."
4,Riveting! A Must read!,"Riveting account of the last decade or so of US foreign policy. The straight ahead account of the events is interesting, but the behind the scenes profiles on the players is what made this book great for me. The personalities, politics, hidden agenda and faults of the players are brought to life and really illustrate how foreign policy decision, even in the best if circumstances, are multi faceted beasts. Amazing the we ever get anything right and this books shows how many times we have gotten it wrong.Definately a must read for any history or foreign policy buffs."
3,A Failure of the Publishing Industry,"Halberstam's reportage is excellent, as usual. But where was the editor of this book? The text not only is repetitive (was it dictated?) but also contains a typo in the first few pages (""flare"" for ""flair"" in my printing). This book retails for almost thirty bucks -- Halberstam and Scribner's should have shelled out the cash for a junior copywriter, at the least. By not doing so, they have shown a shameless disregard for the reader."
3,Excellent- but half of the story,"War in a Time of Peace is a well-written account of several foreign policy challenges that faced the Clinton administration. The book has sparked debate both on the role of US foreign policy and popular interest in international affairs. To supplement understanding of this complex topic Robert Kagan wrote an excellent, and lengthy, review of this book- expanding on many of the issues Mr. Halberstam raised. Mr. Kagan explores the Vietnam Syndrome effect on policy makers, its resulting impact on military intervention during the 1990's, and the motivations of public support for military intervention. A combined reading of Mr. Halberstam's book and Mr. Kagan's essay is esential to understand the breadth and direction of U.S. foreign policy. The essay ""When America Blinked"" is available online (. . .)"
4,"Insightful, well written","Once again, David Halberstam has shown why he is one of the greatest writers of our time. This book explains in great detail how the foreign policy (or lack of one by Clinton) of our presidents has a direct effect on us all. For me, the expose of an inept Clinton White House is somewhat indicative of the mess we are in today. Halberstam does give a little too much praise to Clinton for his domestic policy, but shows clearly how he underestimated the rest of the world.I read Halberstams' ""FIREHOUSE"" and was impressed then. I'm looking forward to reading more of his work."
2,A Case of bad timing,"This book has the misfortune of bad timing. It was published in the May, proceeding September 11. It provides an insightful and detailed review of the Clinton's administration problems in coping with the Yugoslavia crisis. Regrettably that is almost all that it covered. The near complete omission of any discussion of the Middle East and terrorism becomes glaringly apparent after September 11. It is likely that this book would have been considered too incomplete on the subject matter to be published, had it still been on the editor's desk on September 11. As a very pro Clinton review of the Yugoslavia crisis it is of value, but as a review of the overall foreign relations situation during the Clinton years it is only 1/3 complete.A great deal was going on in the terrorist arena during this time period, and it is simply not addressed in this book. Also Clinton's attempt to broker a Middle East peace, and its failure, is barely mentioned."
2,Please send the editor.,"I bought this book with high hopes, but couldn't finish it because of the sloppy style. Where went the editor? Is this the first draft? The material is so important that it is unfortunate the writing style made the book unreadable for me. I actually know Mr. Halberstam as a neighbor on Manhattan's Upper West Side, and I have been impressed by his nuanced commentary on the TV concerning America's recent troubles, so it pains me that I cannot recommend this book. The disappointing reality is that this project seems like an unedited first draft. What should have been an important work of politcial world history is simply unreadable."
3,"A good effort, but too much info is missing","I realize this biography was made in 2000, so when I say ""missing"", I'm not referring to stuff that's happened since then. After a very-detailed account of Springfield's early life, I was diappointed that not as much attention was given to his years as a pop star. Oh, the high points are there: ""Jessie's Girl,"" General Hospital, the death of Rick's dad. But the documentary completely omits his 1983 and 1985 albums (Living in Oz and Tao, respectively), and gives very little time to his 1984 big-screen debut in Hard to Hold.I'm a longtime fan, and I have to admit that even I learned a few tidbits that I didn't know. And casual fans probably won't be bothered by the omissions here. Still, the price is kinda steep for a 50-min. program with no additional features. A collection of music videos would have been a nice touch."
5,rs biography,I find the dvd very informational and learned things i did not know about Rick Springfield.
4,A little dated but still relevant and top analysis,"This book provides a succinct and relevant history of two important countries in South America. Venezuela covers the early years of Indian expansion and the Spanish conquistadors who changed the face of the country. Race relations between the Spaniards and the creoles were sharp in both countries and the rise of Bolivar would bring about independence. Venezuela would fall under the sway of military dictatorships eventually being supplanted by democracies. These democracies would be tenuous and the military would suppress the growth of liberalism through their numerous interventions. Columbia was a complex situation between liberals and conservatives. The liberals held power more often than the conservatives but the social, political and economic realities of the country were shaped by the interplay with each. While this book stops in 1960 it provides an excellent look at the countries history."
3,1/2 way thru . . .,"Am not finished yet, but so far . . . Beginning was a bit slow (pirates in classical times, etc.) but when the author progressed to discussing pirate ""accessories"" (types of weapons, typical ship-board activities, various customs of pirates) the book picked up considerably. Some of these details I was familiar with, however the authors displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of these genres which I appreciated."
5,"Aaargh, me mateys","Don't be fooled by the title...it's not for ""Idiots"". As a charter sailing captain in a historically active pirate location I found this book accurate and concise. Local lore and tales were supported by facts presented in the book. Quick and easy reading will help increase the effectiveness of the sailing tours I conduct. Also some neat tidbits about the life of a pirate and how actually unglamourous it was."
2,Disappointing at best,"I am very disappointed with this watch. First, the instruction manual is indecipherable. It has very little to do with this actual watch. Second, although I am familiar with GPSr's and the problems with lost signals in adverse terrain, it is unacceptable that this watch wipes out all previous data every time it loses the GPS signal (which it does a lot, even under for what are ideal conditions for other GPSr's). So much for the ""distance"" function."
1,Fades Away Quickly,"When I first got this watch I would go to a local park and run one or two laps at 2.2 miles per lap. The first five or six times I did this run, the watch was perfectly accurate with both the pace and the distance. Last time I ran two laps the watch measured the distance out to be 4.6 miles, .2 of a mile long, and earlier today it measured one lap out at 2.44 miles, a full quarter of a mile off over just 2.2 miles. Its just not reliable."
4,The Life Force is strong in this one......,"The album has a definite Wu Tang feel about it; right down to the cameos by Gza and Masta Killa. Lyrically, Afu Ra shows himself to be a very diverse artist who can adapt his style so that it is in keeping with the production of each track. With production from the likes of DJ Premier, Tru Master and DJ Muggs the beats cannot be faulted. All in all, a solid album which flows in accord with the current post-millenial 'live' hip-hop zeitgeist. Buy this and you will not be disappointed."
4,Mad skillz,"This album is series his lyrics are crazy, he's underground and keeps it that way cause he's real. whirlwind through cities if you don't no now ya know go out and buy it..."
2,"GOOD SPIRIT,WACK LYRICS","I LIKE AFU RA'S SPIRIT, BUT DA KID CAN'T RHYME. HIS FLOW SOUNDS TOO AMETUERHE HAS NO RHYTHM IN HIS VOICE. C'MON, THIS DUDE SAYS STUFF LIKE "" I ASSASSINATE LIKE TOXIC WASTE""--WAAAACK! HIS BEATS ARE KIND OF CORNY TOO.I DON'T KNOW HOW THESE OTHER REVIEWERS ARE GIVING HIM PRAISE. I UNDER-STAND HE'S TRYNA REP REAL HIP HOP, BUT IF IT HAS TO BE THIS WACK, PASS MEA MASTER P ALBUM. IT'S FUNNY, EVEN THOUGH HE'S UNDERGROUND, HE'S MOREPOPULAR THAN SUPERIOR LYRICIST SUCH AS MEGALON & PUNKINHEAD."
5,it's here!,"I've been waiting for afu-ra's lp ever since I first heard him on 'mental stamina' with jeru. body of the life force is one of the best hip hop albums released this year. afu's lyrical wizardry combined with premo's golden touch makes for a masterpiece. ""mic stance"", ""d&d soundclash"" ""defeat"" ""whirlwind thru cities (of course) , and ""equality"" are the best tracks on the album. buy this. p.s. i puffed with ky-mani from ""equality"" last summer."
3,"Okay, but lacks appeal.","Ever since Jeru's ""Mental Stamina"" I have been a fan of Afu. By himself however, he seems a bit boring. You almost forget that you're listening to the album. The cut with M.O.P. is live though. And the Coco Brovaz are on it. While the album is not wack, it lacks appeal, which hinders it from reaching the non hip hop heads. However, if you like pure NY hip hop, this is it. I like the album, but it is not for the ""Bling Bling"" fans, just the real hip hop fans."
4,A solid debut,"What would you expect from an album whose executive producer is the ""almighty"" DJ Premier? Nothing but strictly urban NYC HipHop and why not call it underground too?I've never heard about Afu-ra, but when I read that Premier was blessing his album I thought "" Well I'll check it"". This CD has just got it released here, so when I saw it on the CD shop I just pick up without thinking.Good thing is Afu-ra is not the type of MC who spend the entire album claiming how tough he is or how many chicks he can ..., or that he used to be a drug dealer...The guest list is pretty tight, you've got GZA , Masta Killa, MOP, Cocoa Brovaz. Also the producton team is a kind of an all-star 'cause you got Muggs, Beatminerz, Premier himself of course...It's hard to choose the best track though. By the way this a 4.5 stars, 'cause I still can't believe what they did on track 12, just check it and see what I mean..."
3,Good,"It was not what i want. I thought that the CD came with the lyric, but it was not. well is fine."
4,Steve Forrest is eye candy in this one!,"I stumbled across this movie years ago on TV, and I loved it! Steve Forrest is so handsome as the local gambler/saloon owner who irritates Debbie Reynolds until she falls for him. He later starred in the TV series about the SWAT team. Andy Griffith is great, as usual, and this is a very fun movie to watch. I am going to order one to show to my daughter. She loves comedy romances, and this fits the bill."
2,"""Gel""","Call me a dummy, this was not what I expected, the key word being ""Gel"", it doesn't harden, not good for cookies, and that's what I do. I don't know what I was thinking. My fault"
2,It never entered my mind-solo piano by George Shearing,"I bought the Cd specifically for the title piece which I had heard on ABC Classic FM Radio. The CD piece was not quite the same. Unfortunately, your website did not enable me to listen before buying. What I had heard on radio was a version played by George Shearing to a perfect and beautiful Waltz rhythm. I am a dancer, and I was disappointed that the CD did not have the right music I was looking for."
4,3 buckle watchband,My husband has worn this type of watch band for many years. The only changes in this particular one is the buckles. They are rounded now and make it very difficult to buckle. He gripes about it every morning while putting on his watch.Other than that the quality is great.
3,Thin leather,I like the band but the leather is thin and the straps are not the same length. Decent band but the quality could be better.
4,just like the 70s,"When item arrived it reminded me of the ones I had in the 70s. The size, the color and weight seems to be the same. There are 2 things that I didn`t like. I believe other reviews have mentioned this before, but I feel they need to be repeated. Number 1- the rounded buckles make fastening the band really difficult. A square buckle would be much better. Number 2- the straps are really thin and flimsy. I think one or more will break soon. Over all I like the band and will wear it until something breaks."
3,Its okay but not what i expected,"It was a little flimsy he band that holds he watch was thin and i din,t like the feel so i gave i to my nephew"
4,Good Buy,"This watch band is very cool looking and make (for the most part) with good quality leather. But the straps are very thin and curl up on hot days. also the middle buckle scrapes the strap causing the the sides of the strap to have ribbed lines. Also i have a thin wrist and have to wear a wristband underneath to stop it from moving. so have that in mind when you buy.Also after you buy this, a different picture is show in your orders list. but don't worry you will get the product shown."
2,Not like the picture.,"I bought this for my daughter who does somewhat like it. But it is so tiny, I can't even play with her because the rooms and openings for the rooms are so tiny. The whole house is very dark and plain. It looks nothing like the picture and is not nearly as nice as some of the other dollhouses my daughter has. NOT worth the hundred bucks I paid for it either."
1,calico critter townhouse,I bought this for my two 3 year old grandchildren. The rooms are too small and they get frustrated trying to play with the animals and the furniture inside the rooms. They do better taking everything out and playing on the floor with it. My grandson gets frustrated and throws everything out of the rooms.
1,extrenely disappointed,I ordered this house for my 7 year old and was extremely disappointed. For the money I thought it would be bigger and have afew more bells and whistles. It is nothing like the pictures on the outside of the box. No wallpaper on the walls and no carpet on the floors. By the time you get the house to look like the pictures you could easily spend an additional $300 or more. I returned it.
2,Missing pieces,We ordered this dollhouse for our daughters birthday unfortunately we didn't put it together until the day off her birthday at which point we realized that the expandable floor piece was missing. As we needed to give our daughter something for her birthday we couldn't send it back for replacement and they don't supply parts. Disappointing but otherwise a nice product.
2,Don't waste your money,"My daughter got the Calico Critters Townhouse from her grandparents for Christmas. My daughter would probably give it 5 stars but in a parents opinion it is no where near worth the $89 it cost. First the rooms in are very small there is no way she could fit all the furniture in it (she got the living room, kitchen and bedroom set as gifts) and be able to move her critters around. Second, the photo on the box is very deceiving. I knew it came with no furniture but I was expecting the wallpaper and curtains shown on the picture of the box, nope just cheap, plastic, empty walls. For almost $90 you are much better off buying a no name dollhouse for your critter family. Don't waste your money."
4,All in the details,"My 3 & 5 year old love this toy! The lights turn off and on in two of the rooms and the accessories and Calico Critters are super cute. It is a little small to fit all the accessories (like the bathroom fits the tub, toilet and small wall sink), but my kids enjoy trading them out and re-decorating any way. There is a bigger version of this one if you prefer more room. They enjoy plaing with all the little rooms and it is better if we elevate it so they can both play. It doesn't open to a 180 flat front, which does sometimes make it difficult for both to play at the same time, but it is very durable and withstands a lot."
3,Apple Aperture 1.5,I'm sure this is a good product; however I just don't have the time to learn it all. I was disappointed that it did not have a better slideshow program that would save to DVD. I bought Elements 8 for the Mac and it worked much better since it included a program to manage files.
2,Stop!!,"Aperture 1.5 was great, but do yourself a favor and buy 2.0 instead. A much improved work of art and less expensive to boot."
3,Aperture 2.0 has been released!,"In other words, you should not buy version 1.5. (You will for a while get an upgrade for 9.95 from Apple.) But since the new version is $199... Well, you do the math.Looks like a ton of new and improved features, so check it out."
4,"Pretty Good, but not outstanding","Nice set of features. Pretty good raw converter, however noise reduction algorithms can be improved. Major drawback for me is under heavy usage - Aperture (with latest patches etc) regulary (once in couple of hours) crashes."
3,iphoto with more teeth,"This program is basically a more involved iphoto. You can change levels, crop or straighten, add all your meta-info and organize the photos. If you want this to take place of photoshop cs3 or something like that, you aren't going to be happy with Aperature at all. badbadbad for image manipulation..goodgood for adjusting contrast or exposure. Actually, iphoto is good enough. Dont buy this, get photoshop."
3,Niche Product Without a Niche,"I have Aperture, but I haven't touched it since Apple introduced iPhoto '08.For organizing your photos--even by the thousands-- nothing beats iPhoto. Better still, iPhoto '08 comes for free on a new Macintosh, or can upgrade to it for eighty bucks with the purchase of Apple's latest iLife suite. For 90% of what I need to do, iPhoto does just fine. For the other 10% of my photo editing needs, the heavy-duty stuff, nothing but full-on Photoshop CS3 will do.So where does that leave Aperture? In between the cracks of iPhoto and Photoshop.There's nothing wrong with Aperture. But it's not the organizer that iPhoto '08 is, and it's a much weaker editor than Photoshop. Save yourself the money and don't bother."
1,This is a dog,"Forget about this product. Managing photo collections is a horrible slow-motion experience filled with bombs, unexplainable occurrences and incredibe inefficiency. This program was not ready for release and it shows in almost every phase of the application. The interface is terrible and the results are inconsistent and amateurish. This program DOES NOT run like the Quicktime demos which Apple shows. In action the most consistent feature is a spinning beachball as the application plods through even minor tasks. Check back again in two years when Apple either ""upgrades"" this to a real product or allows this pig to die a well-deserved death."
2,Unfortunate bias,"The authors seemed bent on criticizing Gothard. This book was like ""straining out a gnat to swallow a camel"" attempting to uncover evidence of legalism in Gothard's teaching out of its original context. Is it possible that any specific Christian teaching, if standing alone, could be construed as ""out of balance""? Unfortunately, this book will likely appeal to people who dislike Bill Gothard. Personally, I have found the IBLP ministry to be life-changing."
1,Disingenuous Book,"The main author of this book, Mr Veinot who is the founder and president of Midwest Christian Outreach, is so eager to publish any accusation against Bill Gothard on his webpage he doesnt even check out the facts before he passes them alongOne example of this is his online linking of at least 7 sources from the secular news media involving accusations that the IBLP ministry was involved in child abuse. This gleeful passing on of a bad report by Mr Veinot was later found to be untrue and the IBLP ministry was completely exonerated from the false charges. But Mr Veinot has failed to apologize or even remove his links from his webpage. His failure to report that the IBLP has been completely exonerated from these accusations shows that he is not being forthcoming and has done quite a disservice to the Christian cause.I have found this book to be likewise presented with the same approach. Therefore, I could not with a good conscience reccomend this book to anyone."
4,"Review of ""A Matter of Basic Principles""",I think this book should be read by all who have come into contact with the ministries of Bill Gothard. Readers need to interact candidly with the source material and the appropriate passages of Scripture.
4,Bringing light to dark places,"Thanks to Veinot and his fellow researchers, including those more famous Christian leaders who attempted to hold Gothard accountable through Christian mediation. This book, as an in-depth study of Gothard's ministry is long overdue. For too long, one had to actually attend the seminars to actually learn anything about it. This book will be a great resource for those who want to learn about Gothard without committing to the seminar in advance.After reading the book, come back to this page and re-read all of the negative reviews of the book. I find it interesting how similar they are to Gothard's own rebuttals to criticism in the book."
1,"Bill Gothard teachings, since it is based on the bible, Saves my marriage","There is a trend nowadays to attack Bill Gothard and his teachings. As of me and my family I have no need to heed such rubbish!Bill Gothards teachings are very practicall, very easy to digest and very much 100 percent based on the Bible.Because of his teachings, my marriage were saved, my children fears the Lord and loves to memorize bible verses . God bless Bill Gothard!"
1,Terrible and dishonest,"I was going to document all of the misrepresentations and outright lies in this book, but there were so many that we threw the book away. This is an extremely dishonest book and no one should ever buy this book."
1,Politically correctness gone astray,The liberals just cant stand anyone that teaches accountability. So they besmirk the messenger because they cant attack the message. It would be amusing to see them flounder around blindly if it wasnt so sad.Not worth the money unless you are of the ultra liberal mold.
5,Hard to read...but a must.,"God used an IBLP book (Rebuilder's Guide) to touch my heart and restore my marriage after 3 years of divorce. I also -- and later my husband -- attended 3 or 4 Basic Seminars. So, I should be shouting a loud ""Amen"" to all the 1-star reviews...and in fact my gratefulness caused me to defend Bill Gothard and most of his teachings for over 20 years... My thoughts were something along the lines of ""Yes, some of his teachings are wacko (Cabbage Patch dolls, anyone? Evil rock beat?), but most of the other extremes are just the Gothard followers taking things too far.""Then I read this book. It opened my eyes. I can no longer defend him and am embarrassed and humbled that I was not more discerning. I have not quite finished the book, because the information is so disturbing and even depressing that I can only read it for so long before I have to put it down.It is a must-read."
2,Wrong director listed,This fitness video was not directed by Mark Ching.His movie (also called Beyond Expectations) is aromantic comedy from 1998 (See IMDb). Not currentlyavalaible on video as far as I know.
5,GREAT FUN WELL MADE TOY,"My 4 year old son loves Godzilla and this is a perfect adition to his vast collection. I would sugest it for it's durability and it's impressive size. Cool movable parts. Not a good idea to put in the tub or pool because of the jointed movable legs, etc.. Looks like the Space Godzilla in the movie and kids where ever we go who don't even know Godzilla want to play with it."
4,Son's love of all things Godzilla,This product was delivered in a timely manner and in perfect condition ..Of course my youngest has great imaginary moments with his Godzilla toys
4,intense,"incredible album from CRYPTIC SLAUGHTER,i remember listening to this when it first came out..WOW..the only down side is it is all a bit one dimentional...all very similar thats why i gave it 4stars and MONEY TALKS 5stars"
4,Add bridge-fun to your tracks,"These supports are way better than the older Brio bridge supports. The main reason for this is the added size of the support that makes it harder to push over when your child is playing with trains on the bridge or nearby. Another nice feature is the anti-slip material on the top which gives you a better grip on the tracks. Finally, they look nice as well. Only bad thing about this development in Brio bridge supports is the added cost per support.If you want to, you can stack these supports to build very high bridges. However, if you want to build multi-level bridges, I would recommend getting the green stacking track supports instead (Brio 33253) as these supports will give even better stability and also allow for several bridges at different levels crossing eachother, etc. The green supports are a little more expensive but I think they are worth it for multi-level bridges."
5,"Good improvement to the standard ""block"" supports","These are well built & do offer more support than the standard ""block"" supports that come with most sets (& look a little nicer to boot). They work really well in conjunction with the Dazy ""Sure Track"" clips."
5,Great *rock* praise and worship album,"For those who find most praise and worship music too pop-y, this may be a great alternative. Sonicflood, in their self-titled debut and in this live album, provide a more rock-oriented approach to the genre (see also Delirious' ""Cutting Edge"" double album). The band does know, however, when to pull back -- the ""rock levels"" on the album are quite appropriate. Being a live p&w album, flow from one song to the next is important, and this was well done, both in performance and mixing.Purely God-focused lyrics are becoming scarce in Christian music. All sorts of lyrics are helpful in a person's walk, but I am seeing the value of music like this moreso lately. Perhaps the closer we are to God, the more easily the rest of life falls into place. Sonicflood gives their picture of this, and listeners are enriched for it."
3,I think you had to be there....,"Although the songs on this album are an awesome collection of some of the best worship songs going, i really struggle with this album for two reasons...firstly, the balance of the recording is off, so very often i can only hear the lead singer and all backing vocals are lost, not to mention the singing form the crowd, so there are often long gaps in songs where i just assume someone is singing.Secondly, the overall feeling when listening is a ""you had to be there"" vibe, especially during ""You Are Worthy of My Praise"" and the ""Spontaneous Worship"", which often feels awkward and wrong just simply listening to it on a CD.Sonicflood are a very good band and their songs are very inspiring, however, unfortunately, that is wasted on this album which fails to capture what i'm sure was an amazing concert."
5,a good cd,"This album not only praises God, it is also fun and exciting. With a mix of Christian pop and rock, it captures the essence of worshiping Jesus, no matter what your age or race"
5,One of the praise cds I have ever heard.,This is by far one of the best christian cds for teens and young adults. Songs like BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD and DID YOU FEEL THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE are some of the best that I have heard. The cds quality is very good for a live cd and it sounds great. I was very pleased with this album.
2,Didn't receive it.,"I ordered this video for my girlfriend around the 28th of January but never received it. I called four different post offices without any success. I called the seller to see if he would help locate it without success. The whole order has been a hassle. To be fair, the seller did send it from his end promptly (within two days). In my opinion it's the seller's responsibility to get the product to me, especially since I paid for postage. I shouldn't be the one tracking it down. His only suggestion was to cancel the order, which I did."
3,Only double-bass players need apply,"I won't repeat what you can read in other reviews. I will just add that a major letdown for me was to find out that ""foot technique"" here really means double bass. If you don't play double bass (like me) and you are expecting instead to find creative techniques for your bass and your hi-hat, there's zero of that here."
5,Mystery Midrash - Best Anthology of 1999,"This anthology was one of the ""best reads"" of 1999. Most likely the book will be overlooked, hence this review. The storylines, variety, and exceptional writing by the authors make this book a must. Enjoy!"
4,the book that is readable,I bought to book out of curiosity. The stories were alright. I didn't like all the prose. It is readable. I expected more poignant stories I suppose. But all in all good.
5,another great Amazon book!,"My mom got me this book several weeks ago, it layed around until two days ago, wished i picked it up earlier, its a great book! I just sort a got drawn in and could not put it down. This is one that i'll recommend to my friends!"
3,"Roy & Bill,","Cheech & Chong, Ralph & Norton, Butch & Sundance, The Lone Ranger & Tonto, get the drift? These two guys tell some good adventure stories, some life lessons along with some bicycle must know and trivia items. The technical content can be boiled down into about 25 pages but all in all it was a pretty good read if that's what you're looking for."
4,Bike for Life isgreat,This book tells it like it is!If you want to Bike or Golf for a long time you must exercise to keep the body working.The author says it well.
1,Not useful to anyone - There are other biking books,"I am greatly disappointed that I paid for this book on my Kindle. While it is nice the authors try to provide complementary exercises (weight and yoga) for biking, the descriptions are not good at all and there are NO figures or pictures (at least in the Kindle edition) illustrating the exercises. Most of the book seems to be about two guys bragging to each other about their adventures or misadventures in riding.Bottom line - you can find more information for free on the internet at different web sites including Bicycling magazine which has videos of how to do different strength poses w/ yoga."
2,Male Dominated,"The best title for this book should be, ""Biking As a Lifestyle,"" not ""Biking for Life."" It is not concerned with long term biking so much as how to be the best kind of dude and where to compete. Much of the information is found in other cycling and exercise books. The chapter, ""Rolling Relationships: Rules for Reconciling Significant Cycling and Significant Others"" is where the authors show their colors and their testoserone levels. The general idea is that males rule cycling as a sport and as a way of life. Whatever they decide to do with their sporting life takes precedent over any personal relationship. Women are to be cajoled and bribed. To show their benevolence, males should consider giving women some significant role in their cycling world. Silly little boys!There are other books with a balance approach to cycling and fitness. Give this a pass by."
5,Excellent gift for an athlete,Ultra complete comprehensive readable book on the biking and fitness category that gives a super emotional twist intertwining personal stories as you learn about how to bike to 100. I've given this book to many people and they have thanked me profusely. Bill Katovsky and Roy Wallach make a great tandem.
4,Or at least 86,Motivating book that provides a blue print for riding into old age. Many great stories of people who have done it. You will want to do it too. This book will help you at what ever age you decide to start.
3,Great content but where are the illustrations?,"As a 70 year old who who bikes in the city for both recreation and transportation, 'Bike for Life' has terrific content - addressing many issues I need to learn about if I am to bike for more decades. But there are many areas where some illustrations would be helpful - from yoga poses to bike fitting, technique, equipment distinctions, human biology, etc.This is the kind of book where one doesn't always read chapters sequentially but skips around. The lack of illustrations makes it hard to envision something when one has to reread sections to be able to envision what is being written. I imagine that many readers are not bike devotees steeped in the language of the bike world."
4,Party in a box! (but you need more spot lights),"The perfect party in a box!Everyone loves a good disco atmosphere, makes you want to dance until the wee hours...One thing I would suggest if you are buying this ball though is to invest in at least one more spot light and possibly some colored filters. I have to use my directional ceiling lights to create the full effect. Fortunately I had those!Fun fun fun...so worth it! Can't wait for the next party."
3,mirror lamp,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
1,TACKY AND TASTELESS,This is not something that's worth even 99 cents. Boring! I can't believe what people will try to sell!
3,A useful book for educators,"I am a college student majoring in education and I read this book for a class. I think that this book has a lot of great information and useful ideas, but it was hard to get into. Overall, I would say that this is a good book for education majors to read."
4,The Power of Their Ideas Book Review,"I am currently enrolled at Macon State College majoring in elementary education. I read this book for my Education 2403 class. I found the book hard to read at first, but as I read it got easier. It focused on public education and how we can make it better such as by having smaller classrooms. I thought Deborah Meier had very meaningful ideas and beliefs. I would recommend to educators and future educators to read this book because it is very resourceful."
4,Enjoyable read,"Of all the books assigned in my Grad classes. I thought this one was the most relevant, compassionate, and humorous."
3,Too narrow for most cameras,"I bought this bag because the smaller one didn't fit my camera (see my reviews for details). This is just as bad -- way too narrow for most cameras, but the length means you can put in batteries and things like that. But you have to shove the camera in, which is not my idea of a good camera bag. My camera is a digital Kodak, not very big, and it is completely inadequate for it. It just isn't shaped like a camera. Too narrow; for the same square inches, they should have made it more square shaped."
2,Pagen Christs,"In Pagen Christs John M Robertson is too verbose in explaining his opinion and too brief in providing proof. Reading this book was like searching for needles in a hay stack, though some significant information can be found."
2,A Time to Die,"The picture quality was poor, clearly copied from a VHS Tape. Worse, the dialogue ran about half a second after the action as though done with a poor dubbing job. Pretty good story though."
5,Best Purchase I have made!,"I wish I would have found this book before any others. It was exactly what I needed. It is a wonderful guide to how to teach through real life and with plenty of fun. She gives an extensive list of things in your home that you already have that enrich your childs learning expirience. She talks about making habits in your home. It reminds me of ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It sould be called Highly Effective Habits of the Homeschooling Family. It has been such a comfort to me and has given me wonderful new and fresh ideas to add to what I had been doing. She suggests several games that help children learn. I seriously cannot say enough about how much I love this book. It is a breath of fresh air. It isn't telling you that her way is the only way or the best way it is merely stating the fundamentals, the facts, the basics, learning should not be dreaded! Worth Every penny. I only wish it was sold in hard back since I use it so often, Mine has great wear and tear."
4,"Great product, just a few drawbacks","Positive aspects:1) real 16:9 mode is excellent with a 16:9 screen2) great brightness, even in economy mode3) great colours4) scarcely any screendoor effect if the screen is 2.5 times the screen length away from you5) barely noticeable noise in economy mode6) excellent compatibility (component, composite, video, VGA, etc.)7) very easy of useNegative aspects:1) component YUV necessary to get a sharp picture2) contrast could be better3) has to be put really close to the screen!Problems1) during big travelling shots the image can be jerky at times"
5,"Delicious Angel Food Cake- Fat Free, Fast, and Easy","I bought a case of the Betty Crocker Angel Food Cake on Amazon.com grocery. The price was cheap, the shipping was free, and the cake is easy to make (you just add 1 1/4 cups of water to the mix). What more could you want for a fat free snack? Right after I take the cake out of the oven, I like to put it upside down on a wine bottle (just like my mother used to do!) and pull off and nibble little hunks of the sweet crust part while it cools. Sigh!"
1,Very poor quality pictures,"Your photos will look awful in this frame. Nothing even close to what you would see on your computer monitor (LCD panel or tube). Nothing even close to what they show on their advertising of this frame either.The resolution is 800x600, but the pictures all looks ""blocky."" Even when using photo software to sample the photo down to 800x600 and previewing it on my PC, it still looks blocky.Also, the edges of the picture tend to ""wash out"" and be brighter than the rest of the photo. You can adjust the brightness, but then the center of the picture is too dark and the edges still look whitewashed.Their tag line is ""easier than putting a picture into a frame."" Maybe. But nothing close to the quality of printing a picture or looking at it on your computer.We got this for my parents for Christmas. We'll be returning it and getting them something else."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"This is STN screen and not all that clear you should check ot some of the new 8x10 MemoryFrames with TFT. They are 800x600 dpi, have sound and a great picture. You can upload directly from a USB camera too and it shows up to 80 pics. I saw it at a recent photo show and it looks great. I can't wait to get one!I think the company is Pacific Digital. Check it out before you are dissapointed with this one. If you're into digital photography the Memoryframe is the way to go."
2,Digital frame,"I have previously owned a DigiFrame frame that was pretty high end and very small so I tried this Digital Frame. The controls are not well explained and the photo quality is poor. There is a MAJOR blue hue to all photos. The photo quality is much better with Digiframe but the cost is almost twice as much. I would not recommend this frame, and when searching for digital frames, make sure that there are controls to ""tweek"" the color and brightness. good luck!"
1,digital frame blahs,"Nice idea, but the image quality is very poor. Adjusting the images to the recommended size still produced a very grainy view, no matter what angle you view from. You'll be better off using a laptop and viewing/displaying photos with a slideshow feature available on most photo software."
2,Setting expectations for DPF-104,"Just received and setup the DPF-104. I was immediately disappointed with the clarity of the display - even for images specifically sized at 600x800 (max resolution of unit). The LCD has a VERY narrow angle of view - you almost have to look at frame directly 90 degrees to the LCD to get a clear view. I would also say that color rendition and saturation is nothing to get excited about. Another annoying point is that even pictures already stored in portrait (600wide x 800tall) still need to be rotated manually on the frame (and reset every time you unplug the card). I own several Kodak SmartFrames, which unfortunately have a small, landscape only, LCD -- but they are razor sharp with excellent color. Must say, however, that my recent warranty repair experience with the manufacturer was excellent."
5,A Must See,"Everyone (wether he/she is pro Palestine or pro israel) should watch this movie. With the exception of few scenes, the movie reflects the daily life of Palestinians under the israeli occupation."
1,Worst movie ever,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I bought it in order to study arabic, and was distraught to find very little dialogue. The movie isn't a comedy, as the reviews and trailer would make you think. It actually gets very boring, as it repeats the same scenes over...and over...and....over........ Overall, this movie seems to be a rather pathetic attempt by a film-maker to show how mundane life in Israel-occupied Palestine is. It's propaganda, and not very good propaganda at that."
2,meh,"could have been a good album, but the over-production kills it. korn make good albums when they are raw (Korn, Life is Peachy, Take a Look in the Mirror). Team them up with a slick producer and the life is sucked right out (Issues, Follow the Leader, SYOTOS). i give it 2 stars becasue it's tolerable...but it never gets enough steam."
2,I support head all the way,"He is the reason korn is hear to day, so all you korn fans, Dont hate him love him. Because he made the world of metal a whole lot better. If you were a true korn fan you will support him all the way.Why blame him that he left korn if you were unhappy you will do the same thing.head is my roll model he made me pick up a guitar and, Made me play like thire was no tomorrow.ok this album was ok but not the old school korn i like.everybody gives up something everyday that is part of LIFE So deal with it."
1,RIP Korn,Korn is dead. Korn comitted suicide by recording Follow The Leader back in 1998. That means that they're dead for 8 years. That means their albums only stink even more.
2,gay,this is by far the worst korn cd since issues. I guess the fact that they lost head really mad a different. Jonathan is being fake and its just sad. Can't they go back to playing things like blind or twist?
1,Korn is nothing,This has to be the worst cd i ever heard on the year. I heard it all before in the leak on MTV and is a piece of crap. Davis wanted to make like the industrial korn in most of the songs. If i could give it 0 stars i would.
1,unworthy half hearted effort,"I am HUGE Korn fan and found some tracks respectable on the last 2 albums. Usually when a band looses a member and releases a greatest hits album it signals the end. This unworthy half hearted effort prooves it. Industrial grind with synth went out in the late 90's. I swear if the cover didnt say ""Korn"", that i was listening to a Marilyn Manson album - Mechancial Animals? This album is already on ebay and I had it for 5 hours! Horrible. To much talent wasted - Hate to say it, but time to hang it up and while Head is out finding God, the remaining four need to take a look in the mirror and find some heart, passion and vigor...or they can stay on whatever side they are on."
1,An interesting look at something....,"Yo, Pisser here. I am giving this 3 stars to keep the average rating the same because I am not sure if this guy has written a review before and is somehow futily trying to fight back. Anyway, look at this:""Yea.....Korn > Iced Earth.I have no clue if there is anybody except morons who like iced earth.""By ""morons"" he means non-mallcore kids, then, yes, they are all morons.Why is Korn > Iced Earth? Well, I guess it's because the latter can't play their instruments, can't solo, the guy can actually sing (operatic nonetheless) and overall make much higher quality of music despite not being featured on MTV. (pause) Oh, wait a minute! That was KORN I was talking about! Oh, sorry!Superior instrumentals, superior lyrics, superior song structures and compositions and superior production (not needing to sound so polished to sound good) are the reasons why Iced Earth is superior to Kornkob."
2,"A new direction for a franchise, but clearly sophmoric","Korn takes on a new direction, departing from their raw brand of metal to explore the more heavily produced sound. I never have a problem with a well established band branching out into a new style, but this effort is substandard for a band that I've come to expect great things from.The beats are too straightforward, the songs are hard to distinguish, the choruses are repetitive, and it sounds like they stifled the band's most important & creative instrument, Jonathan's voice. He's been reduced to a piece of the band rather than the star that flies above, and interacts with, the dark & passionate instrumental melodies & harmonies we heard on past albums.I have come to expect great music from Korn over the years, and this album simply isn't great music. I will make darned sure to preview any future Korn albums before hitting the ""purchase"" button in the future."
4,Not worth the money,"Let me start off by saying that thisalbum is the worst Korn album ever.There is only about 2 song's thatI like on it and that are good.The first song,""Twisted Transistor""is a good song.Also track #11 called""Liar"" is a great tune.But other than thatthere is no song's that are musicallyworth a listen too.If you're a fan thatwants to own all the albums just to collecttham that's fine.But if you just wanna listento it just buy the singles.I hope this was a helpful review for everyone."
2,very disappointed,"Hate the fact that Davis used outside writers, and the fact that the sound is too polished. The days of heavy Korn are gone im affraid. Guess ill go back to listening to the debut cd and remembering the real times. the times when the band was hungry and had aggression. there is none of that here. sorry guys, but this was not the right direction to go in. gad, it pisses me off to say that... what a drag."
5,Korns going a long way,ok so they have been though so much within the 2 years but look at this the loss of a band member(again)and they are still puting out good things....ive been a fan of them sience i can remeber and they have NEVER gone down to all of u who think they have need to liten to the cd a few more times...it will click with all of u guys just wait and if u dont get it then you shouldnt be listing to them anyways......
4,The 'Sybil' of the band's career,"Korn experiments, and that's a cool thing...HOWEVER it's to the point where they have almost multiple personalities and it's getting hard to identify with the band....revolving band members, revolving genres from song to song....YET they still make it work. Very good songs on here...just don't base liking the CD off what you heard on the debut.I'd recomend the Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded as well for an amazing CD, with alot more old school Korn riffsAll That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
4,Satisfying Album by koRn,"I liked this album, I mean it took me twice to enjoy it...but I really liked it. With their first album without Head, they pull it of with the songs like Twisted Transistor, Politics, Love Song, and Coming Undone. Those are just to name the best on the album. All in all, if you like Korn, buy this cd. It is an album to have in your collection!!Also, give limpbizkit's: Unquestionable Truth pt. 1 a chance, it took me two times of listening to enjoy it as well but after listening, I really like that ep now."
3,The weak link in the Korn music catalog.,"""Twisted Transistor"" is kind of a cool song, and there are a handful of other songs on here that are pretty good, like ""Coming Undone"", ""Politics"", and ""Souvenier"", but I don't know if I like this stripped down, industrial sound that they have tried on. It has some moments, but overall, I was unimpressed with it. Stick to earlier Korn if you are just discovering them, and if you buy it, plan on being surprised by the new musical direction."
3,VERY different,"I am a huge Korn fan, and I admit this album is definately not for everybody. I greatly recommend that you preview it with a friend or something before buying. Not every Korn fan will enjoy this new experiment. It's hard to even describe. I wouldn't completely ignore it, however. It is still very interesting and has some very awesome points. Once again, I suggest you check it out before you buy."
3,"Korn's changing, but they still good","I thought the album was alright. I kind of preffer their other styles, but this album was alright. It's just that usually bands change and start to burn out a tad, and it's not always easy to keep up with facinating ideas, so I still give them credit.It seems that every album they have realeased has been good. Not all bands are like that, usually they'll run out ideas and change terribly, not Korn! SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE doesn't suck, it's just simply not there best album that's all. I liked twisted transister, hypocrits, souvenere, coming undone, and liar."
5,Awsome,You'll forget all about Head after hearing this album. Korn's older stuff has allways rocked but See You on the Other Side is new and refreshing and rocks. If you don't own this album you should even if your not a Korn fan.
4,The Boys are Back in Town!!!,"Finally, Korn has returned after a temultuous 2 year break!! I get really sick of people automatically selling them short because their copy-cats have overtaken them in the ""pop"" arena. SYOTOS..does what ""Untouchables"" attempted to do...shed the skin of ""nu-metal"" and blend new elements of industrial and classic rock. I believe on this record, Korn did a bang up job. People need to get over the first 3 records (As do metallica fans) they will NEVER recreate them...music is an evolutionary game...(even AC/DC changes it up from time to time!). There are alot of great songs on this cd. ""Tearjerker"" made my jaw hit the floor...it shows that JD can actually sing his ass off. Bottom Line...this record will most likely return Korn to the level they were at in 1999...and I can't wait!!!!"
2,Weak,"This is album is very weak. I kept skipping through tracks waiting to hear the bass slapping, and hard riffs.....never happened. Yea, yea, this album is different and Korn has ""evolved"".....whatever.......if I want different I will buy something different. I want to hear Korn rock, and rock hard.....not try some pop sounding crap because it is ""different""."
1,Son of a.....,and korn makes it just under the deadline to be voted for Worst album of the year. Amazing... truly amazing... how a band can go from being such a great band... to this.... ... whatever you can call this. I'm so dissappointed it's not even funny.listen before you buy people.
1,Absolute trash,"The title of my review says it all...I already wasted my time listening to that garbage CD, I won't waste much more talking about it. I've been a fan of Korn since '94. 'Korn', 'Life is Peachy', 'Follow the Leader', and 'Issues' are 4 of my favorite albums ever. This latest effort does not even come close. Avoid at all costs. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
1,From the people who brought you Sk8er Boi and Complicated!,"Doesn't it bother anybody that songwriters for Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, and Avril Lavigne contributed to this album? In particular, the ones who wrote ""Sk8er Boi"" and ""Complicated""?I'm talking about The Matrix, a music production team that engineers hit singles and co-wrote this album. In other words, you aren't really listening to Korn, you're listening to Scott Spock, Lauren Christy and Graham Edwards.I'm not sure you can get any closer to selling out than that."
4,Surprisingly great!!!,"After the release of ""Take a look in the Mirror"", I thought KoRn were not able to continue their evolution heard on Untouchables. But it's not the case. Oh yes, you'll see a lot of angry ""Heavy Metal fans"" saying KoRn has turned into a pop music band. It's false: the atmosphere on this album is really heavy, riffs are still here and the electronic programmation really kicks a**!2 or 3 songs are not so good and guitars were better with ""Head"" (so 4 stars only) but in fact I would have rated this album 4.5 on 5!!!KKKOOOORRRRRNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best album of 2005 hands down,"KoRns new album SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is amazing to say the least. This album is completely different from any album put out by KoRn before. So it doesnt matter weather your a KoRn fans or not its sure to impress you. Some of my favorite songs are THROW ME AWAY, SOMING UNDONE, and I'VE SEEN IT ALL. Not only do you get 14 AWSOME tracks but you get a bonus disc With 7 other songs! and a free 1 year membership to but BSC wich is KoRn fan club. So all in all i'd recommend this album to anyone."
4,Thank you KORN !!!!!,"this cd was much better than their last two and I felt like I was giving up on Korn. Jonathon Davis surprised the hell out of me when they released this new decent album. Come on people, do not hatefully bash this new release because it is very well written and on a much more positive side of life. The lyrics are much more fun and you can relate to korn better than the old I want to die and cut my wrist lyrics of the past. I really enjoyed this cd top to bottom. Korn is not dead and this cd is a great catchy cd that will grab your attention. Kudos to korn, looking forward to the future. but honestly, this cd is not bad, just give it a chance"
2,Some good songs...,"See you on the other side got some good songs like Politics, Hypocrites and Twisted Transistor...But the other songs seems sooooo uninspired...Jonathan Davis become another singer, and the old Jon is way more angry and creative...Jon seems tired and uninspired, but it's the way music goes...All the bands got high moments and than disappear... I think is time to Korn to retire and enjoy past great records like KORN's debut and LIFE IS PEACHY..."
5,korn for life,I love all things korn but i am pretty sure that this is my fav album. I have very mixed feelings about their new album but i will be a fan until i die. Guess the new stuff will just have to grow on me :D
3,Could have benn a LOT better.,"This album wasn't bad at all. Unfortunately, it wasn't Korn either. I know a lot of Korn fans hated this album and their ""Untitled"" album. I loved untitled and only somewhat liked this album. Coming Undone, Politics and Throw me Away are the Main highlights, the rest of the tracks are just OK. I think this album was over-produced and lacked korns signature sound. Like I said before Coming Undone, Politics and Throw me Away are the only real ""Korn Songs"". I was disapointed."
1,Let down,"Guys, I love Korn, been with em since Life Is Peachy, have every cd and most of their singles, but their newest one isn't very good. And everyone talks about how they have evolved or w/e... I just don't think they got any more good music left in them. Yea they can put out a single or two off their newest stuff but the rest is just filler. Don't buy it, I'm still disappointed (broke my little twisted Korn loving heart to write this)."
2,ehh,"Again I ask, what is with the squirrel nuts? It still doesn't bother me since it has the verbal power of ""poopy face"". Do you actually know what malnourished means, it has nothing to do with acting badass. I am not mallcore, korn is the extent of what I listen to that is considered mallcore. I listen to korn because I can actually understand what there saying, half the song does not consist of someone going AHHH! and he actually has vocal cords instead of grunting and screaming everthing. And what exactly is adult music, someone screaming at the top of their lungs for 4 minutes and giving it a title. And about the clothes comeback, I don't wear dog chains, I don't even think I have a band t-shirt. Give up the whole MTV argument since I don't think anyone here actually watches it, and I think it only plays rap now, whenever it does play music."
1,KORNY! :(,"this album is terrible! it's just some LAME guys singing about how wrong the world is and how right they are! and hey-in the vid for ""coming undone"" why does the one guy wear a kilt?! talk about weird! also, why does he have gold teeth? ugh. I'm just trying to forget about it! ohh! it is soo ANNOYING i could just SNAP!!!!! i mean, i'm normally a lot nicer than this and shouldn't waste my time writing mean reviews, but ya gotta do whatcha gotta do and i did it. if you have an opinion even CLOSE to mine, please don't buy this! i beg of you! PLEEAASE!!!!!!!!"
1,RoCK oN!!!,"This album sucks bad. Nothing about it is any good whatsoever. Dont wast your money on it, and dont waste your time downloading it. First of all, Korn sucks. They think they are cool because they spell theyre name with a backwards R and a mispelled word, but who cares, your not cool, your music sucks, and you should stop making it. I think this album should be removed from the market to prevent any other poor young kids from hearing this garbage."
1,Korn gone bad,"Ok, have been a fan of Korn since Follow the leader.After hearing this album trough many times, i cant get why the sudden change. They are some mean riffs to head bang to, buy why Jonathan begins to sing these pop pitch i dont know. Korn used to be mean, aggresive. Where you could put some anger in. Now you can dance to it on the dance floor. Everytime Korn puts out an album.. its supposed to be ""heaviest to date"" after Issues it has become the opposite. As they put it in the Twisted Transitor : Rock is dead ? Well, if you make music like this, it is."
1,i don't like korn. they're bad.,"OK, I don't have to like KO(stupid backwards R)N if I don't want to. I have written this same review about 4 times, and guess what, it NEVER GETS POSTED!! i heard one of the singles from this cd and i just didn't like it. is that OK??? korn does not appeal to me. OK??? i have my opinion too! i think they used to be a decent band, but they should have just quit while they were ahead. this is what I think!! no one is making YOU agree with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,What are you guys talking about?,"Alright, first of all, all these reviews from people telling KoRn to ""retire"" and to ""give it up"" have got to stop. Yes, this cd is quite possibly their most experimental yet, but I think it's ingenius. I'll admit it, when I first bought the cd, it took me a couple times of listening to it to get used to it. It was just shocking to me because of the fact that they had us all used to one particular sound. And on this cd, they don't have that sound... as much. Yes, they've lost their guitarist and it's defintely not the same with Head. But that doesn't mean they should just quit. I have been a huge fan of KoRn ever since they came out and intend to be there when they decide to call it quits. But until then, you can guarantee I will be behind them 100% no matter what they decide to do with their music."
4,good not best tho,this was a pretty good album bit its wasnt really kOrN Alot of the b-sides were better than the album songs
5,KoRn !!See You On The Other Side!!,"KoRn---See You On The Other Side---is a great album I recomemend it to anyone one who likes Metal/Heavy Rock, My Favourite song is --COMING UNDONE-- and --TWISTED TRANSISTER--Thank You For Reading My Review Plz Check My Other Reviews :-)"
3,Not one of there best albums.,"I think that this album is kind of weak. Korn lost there unique sound. Now there are mostly replaced by keyboards and other things. I think that ""Head"" should come back and put Korn back on the right track(the way they were before this album). But other than this being there weakest album yet Korn is still the best. And for people that gave this album an 5, stick to your pop (stupid) music, this music is not for you people.Through Me Away - is one of the better songs on the album."
4,Best album to date IMHO,"Good production. good package, good, solid work. Don't own any other Korn albums & never will."
5,can you help me?,"its a great cd, but on the bonus disc of the extended edition, the two remixes of twisted transister didn't work for me.(i tried playing it in 2 cd players, a dvd player, and a cd drive) please help me"
5,SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE BY KORN,"IT'S AWESOME! A LITTLE DIFFERENT, MORE HEAVY. JONS VOCALS ARE CLEAN AND THE MUSIC IS TIGHT. I PERSONALLY LIKE OPEN UP, COMING UNDONE AND LIAR THE MOST. IF YOU LIKE TO DANCE, THE SECOND CD HAS A COUPLE REMIXES OF TWISTED TRANSISTER. I THINK THE DUMMIES MIX ROCKS. ANYONE WHO IS INTO A HEAVY SOUND OR LIKES KORN WILL BE REALLY IMPRESSED. KORN FANS NEED TO ADD THIS ONE TO THEIR COLLECTION!!!"
2,Dissapointing,"I was getting the clean version (my parents are protective)beacause i hears twisted transitor on the radio and I liked it. So, i got home,poped the cd in my cd player nad litsened,after liar i said ""This is enough"". Its not as good as the old KoRn. Instead of this get life is peachy,koRn,and their greatest hits,and donwload twisted transitor of of Itunes of something."
2,More krap by Korn!,"It's not that the music isn't as punishing and unique as prior Korn outings, but it seems that with each new Korn album that's released, the more and more their song structure breaks down. What I mean by that is; Jonathan Davis has no vocal melody patterns on the majority of this album. ""Twisted Transistor"" is probably one of the few songs that do.It seems like he's making his patterns up as he goes along, with no real repetitiveness or hooks. This makes it difficult as a listener to recall the songs later on (for example, singing them in your head). What Korn needs to do is return to repetitive patterns like they had on ""Got the Life,"" ""Falling Away From Me,"" and ""Make Me Bad."" It's still possible for them to do that and keep their unique rock sound."
2,oh god,nu metal has never been my thing even thou my favourite band system of a down is addmittedly nu metal nu metal have always been ok they where the pioneers of nu metal but ive never really liked there work they are good for the genre there in but in standard terms i dont like them they seem to shouty admittedly they are innovitive at times but there isnt that much passion just break neck riffs i give it two because by there standards this is a good album any other korn album ive had the disadvantage of hearing would get 1 so if you like korn this is the one for you
2,ehh,"[...] I think the ""insatiable craving to play with trouser snakes"" drives one to talk about squirrel nuts and pole smoking. Why do you assume everyone is malnourished, are you one of those fat kids that thinks eating is a good substitute for exercise. I guess I'll take the high road and not call you names, especially ones involving balls. What is with the ""squirrel nuts"" thing anyway, is that meant to be offensive, because I could have sworn I called people that when I was five. And what does getting a job have to do with ""expanding your horizons"", I have a job but I still listen to the same kind of music. I am glad you express your opinion, it just seems like you take it too far when you call other reviewers names and assume the band members are gay because you don't like their music or hair. Oh by the way, I'm not rebelling against my parents, in fact I listened to them and am now a graduating engineer, but good luck with that prostitution thing you said you do."
3,decent album,"this album again shows that korn has become a mediocre band.I was a big fan of this band but since the album issues this band has gone down hillbest songs of the album:coming undone,hypocrites,liaroveral 70/100"
1,!!!KORN=DEAD!!! MINUS 5 STARS,"This band is the stupidest band I've heard, have you got the memo ""nu-metal is dead"". Please bring you sorry assess into the millennia? Damn why did there even bother with a cd like this. I should have known korn=sellouts. Do not by this cd... yes click on the not helpfull sign. To all you mallcore idiots listen to better music don't stick to a washed up mall core band !!DAMN IDIOTS!!"
1,If there were only a zero star option...,"I'm quite speechless actually...but I feel like I have to post this. This album is trash. It's very unfortunate that Korn had the balls to release an album of this caliber, but hey whatever pays the bills...right? I'm looking forward to the Avril Lavigne Hanson and Korn tour...such a sad day for music."
3,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:lots of musical experimentation,wonderful packaging and imagery,more singing less whining, their most powerful effort yetbad side:no lyric sheet,no second guitarist Brianstandout tracks:liar; coming undone; tearjerker; hypocrites; souvenir"
4,KoRn!!!,"Hey!! Yoohoo! Yeah, this is to all people who thoght this album sucked. To me and my friends, this album was great. Tearjerker was off a little bit because of how it sounded(same as track 13). But, this album was better than Take A Look In The Mirror. That album was good but the sounds of the guitars and stuff sounded like they cheaply made it. A few years with out making a cd helped KoRn(in my opinion.) So get to a store,[...] Anyways go and get the album!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,this is NOT korn,this is their most disappointing work yet. Take a look in the mirror was the beginning of this downward spiral. Sad to see them go.
4,a brand new KoRn sound,"track scores for those who download on P2P programs (sorry i can't write a long review since i don't know english that much but is a excellent album)1. Twisted Transistor: 9.02. Politics: 8.53. Hypocrites: 9.04. Souviner (Of Sadness): 8.5 i love the beats of this one5. 10 or a 2-Way: 7.56. Throw Me Away: 9.57. Love Song: 8.08. Open Up: 8.59. Coming Undone: 9.0 - has drums reminscent of Queen's ""We Will Rock You""10. Getting Off: 6.511. Liar: 9.512. For No One: 7.013. Seen It All: 8.014. Tearjerker (Saturated Lonliness): 8.0"
1,Korn is Dead!,"This album is just plain awful! This latest effort by Korn lacks melody, crafty guitar riffs, and teeth. It has been down hill for these guys ever since they released ""Untouchables."" This latest creation, ""See You On The Other Side,"" is a desperate attempt at change in order to boost sagging album sales. Well, the experiment didn't work. I can't blame Brian Welch (a.k.a. Head) for leaving this group...he knew that the end was near."
1,Korn in my Dump,"This is the worst CD ,not only from Korn, but from any CD that I've listened to lately. There sounds like there was no effort put into this whatsoever. I would actually say the best way to describe this CD is freakin boring as he11!!! While Head is down in the Dark COntinent trying to help som crazy cannibal folk, the rest of the band is up here wasting out time and money. Thanks fo nothing. Flush this Korny log right down the toilet."
1,This is something Madonna or Britney would have done,"Ok,How to start, i spent my money in this album, and it was a dissapointment, i've been a fan of Korn, since the beggining but i think that Brian ""Head"" Welch wasn't the only thing they have lost, they also lose their touch and for me this is the crappiest album i've ever heard in my entire life, none of the songs are good and im truly sorry to say this but this is a big dissapointment, it's good that Jonathan aint bitchin' bout his past anymore, but the change of new metal to pop crap rock is awful, cause this ain't heavy at all, and it took me by surprise cause it has been commented ""the evolution of heavy"", but these days there are heavier bands around. For any of you guys that it's planning to buy this album, don't spend your money in this, listen to their old stuff or any real heavy bands like Chimaira, Trivium or whatever you want to listen, but please don't spend your money in this, you will thank me."
4,Something new and twist it with old,"For all the other reviews I must say, smell what your shoveling, this is the direction that band less 1 guitar player is taking. I must say this is just as heavy as anything else they have done, perhaps not as dark but a welcome change being that. I have to admit the songs where Atticus Ross is added to the production may have a more industrial edge, this more of a natural progression that i always thought the band could take, it sounds just as i assumed it might. I like the flavor of Johns' vocal arrangements and the time changes.This is over all a great change of pace from Take a look in the mirror album which i do agree was more of trying for the first shot out the door of their self titled album. Don't take me wrong it was a great album but this album has more lasting verses and choruses(did i spell that right). Truely a inspriring release! Nice change from the last few efforts."
5,Finally...Different!,"wow, koRn has finally done it! This is probably their best work since their self titled debut album, life is peachy and follow the leader! this really puts them in a different state of mind musically and emotionally. no more talking about bad childhoods, something different! KoRn, keep on rocking your doing it! my fav. tracks are TearJerker, and Hypocrite, and Love Song"
1,Ready...set...SUCK!,"This album is where Korn died...at least to me it is. I thought everything before this was great, and then from here on out Korn just lost it. They got too emo and mainstream with this. Their second self-titled tried to pick it up a little...but was still way too mainstream. And now with Korn III - Remember Who You Are...it's just too little too late. It sounds so bland. I wish Korn would take some advice from their album title and remember who they were."
3,Korn's Disappointment,"I don't know if it was the loss of Head that completely destroyed Korn's old sound, but something did it, and the result is not great. This album was highly anticipated by many, and proved to be overall disappointing.It does have its high points that rock as hard as any Korn track of old, which include Twisted Transistor, Politics, Hypocrates, Liar, and For No One. Although these five songs are all very good and demonstrate the evolution which would be appropriate for Korn, the album as a whole is just weighed down too much by the slowness and weakness of the rest of it.One good thing that Jonathan Davis did on this record was looking to other sources of lyrical inspiration than his own pain and sorrow, which was beginning to become cliche Korn, but it is obvious that musically they are not where they should be with this one."
2,The end of an era,"Let me start off by saying this isn't a bad album. It doesn't blend in with the ""nu-metal heap"" or anything, it is worth listening to, but if you're an old school Korn fan who was far less than content with Issues and/or Untouchables stay away. There are two major problems with this cd that I can pinpoint exactly: 1)only one guitarist...there's nothing wrong with munky, but there's only one of him, 2)NO SLAP BASS!!! I miss fieldy's slap bass...hearing the smack of every note as he pounded it out was incredible, and it's gone. To me, that sound coupled with Jon's voice was Korn's identity. On a larger scale, the whole album just doesn't sound as great as it could have. Have of the stuff is too melodic nu-metalish, and the other half is too Nine Inch Nailsish. I was hoping Korn would be able to continue with the lose of Brian, and though they are, their change in sound will not appeal to old school fans, but it will most definetly bring in a new generation of fans."
2,Disappointing!,I expected much more of this book. There are MANY cities and towns in the U.S. having 4-year colleges .... and this book perhaps looks at 0.5% of the total number .... Perhaps I should have looked at the book's page count before I bought it. That would have been a clue to the low number of cities and towns covered. Look at the low prices being asked for used copies of this book. That gives a telling clue to the low values that buyers of the new book place on their used books. I personally do not recommend this book.
2,Voting with the Majority,"This book might be of good use to a person with no idea of what college and university towns exist in the United States. But despite the great pains the author takes in the introductory chapter to tell us how many miles he traveled in researching it, for anyone -- like me -- who has looked into the subject a little Choose a College Town will feel slim and superficial, with a decided tilt toward the places -- Santa Cruz and Bennington, VT, e.g -- that the author already knows well. I could also do without the cutesy (?) borrowing of obvious 60's song titles for chapter sub-heads. Exam this in-store before buying."
2,Review of Choose a College Town for Retirement,I was very disappointed also with this book. I was familiar with at least 95% of the colleges listed. I'd hoped to see some new and refreshing ideas for college towns but was able to skim this book in a very short time and put it down. It wasn't worth the money.
3,Retirement in a College Town,There was some good information but the book was not as useful as I had hoped. The maps were not useful at all and the regional breakdown was strange.
4,Choosing a college town for retirement,"Very informative. A lot of very useful information for each town that let's you ""comparative shop"" each town against the others.There could be another 20-30 college towns included for completeness.The book is set up well in a good order."
5,Best Choice,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who is very organized in all areas except her car. She was thrilled to have something so handy to keep everything at hand instead of flying all over when she turned a corner. The material of construction lets this cup fit into various size cupholders, which is wonderful. when her friends saw hers they wanted to get one also, but at this price I was able to treat them. I'm ordering more for my other children's holiday stockings this year."
5,organized choas,"the cell phone cup works as advertised. fits the cell phone, plus a pen, nail clippers and some allergy eye drops. all right at my fingertips - no more fumbling in a glove box looking for stuff. great invention - wish I had thought of it"
1,Nigh on to worthless,Seemed like a good idea but it's base is too narrow for my cup holder so I had to saw it down to fit. The holes are too large for cheap pens and the slots too small for my cell phone. Over bumpy roads items vibrate out of the cellcup and the cellcup vibrates out of the cupholder.
2,Lock is just okay,"The lock is cheaper than the picture shows and barely fits on my trailer because of the type of coupler on the Haulmark. I bought two locks, but have 3 trailers so I can use them on the other trailers. The ball that fits up into the hole I thought was solid metal, that's why it is not shown in the picture, it is just two pieces of metal tacked together in the shape of a ball. It doesn't do what I need, so I'm looking again. I own two, but wish I didn't."
3,Hoss4570,Got mine and was a little dissapointed. It does not fit over the bulldog hitch like I figgured it would but juts out in front. I envisioned one that would totally encompass the hitch but maybe it will deter a theif. Hope so.
1,Masterlock 379DAT is NOT Universal,I have a 6 year old premium bass boat trailer with 2 inch coupler and surge brakes. The tongue style is UFP. This lock does not fit snugly against the tongue...it angles away with a 1.5 inch gap. Someone could easily get a pry bar between the lock and the tongue. A thief may not remove the lock but they will seriously damage the tongue. I am going to get stuck with $13 in wasted shipping returning this junk. Don't make the same mistake!
2,Will scratch your hitch,"Just a warning to all. This device seems to be made well, but the ""hood"" does not actually fit a standard 2"" hitch. Yes, the ball fits inside the hitch just fine, but the hood is not wide enough to actually slip fully over the outside of the hitch. So putting this lock onto my hitch even one time fully scratched up the hitch. The hood cannot fit around the hitch so it just ends up rubbing the hitch.But, the lock does work and it stays locked on with the hitch clasp in the up or down position. So I still give it two stars. But for me, I will glue some rubber strips into the inside of hood and then at least it can function as a good lock without scratching."
3,"Good, but...","The locking mechanism is steel, but the body is all plastic. I'm not sure how well it will hold up to abuse. I think it would stop someone from stealing the trailer, but even the most minor attack and I'd have to cut the thing off. Easy to use, but just doesn't seem as tough."
1,Terrible!!,"This is a horrible blend. No body, bad flavor, just plain weak. I thought I stumbled upon a coffee flavor that I had not been able to find for a long, long time. This is nothing like I remember or had in the past. What's even worse is I had to buy for bags of this mess. Don't do it. Pass on this."
1,WORSE PRODUCT THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY 2003 SL500 TO HELP WITH BRAKE DUST PROBLEM AS I KEEP IT IMMACULANT AS IT ONLY HAS 28K MILES,BUT THESE THING INSTALLED WITH NEW ROTORS AND BROKE IN/ SEATED PERFECTLY ARE THE SUEALINGEST THINGS EVER. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT CONSTANT SQUEALING. WILL BE BUYING FACTORY AGAIN AND WASTING A LOT OF MONEY."
1,Nelly & Mya Music Videos on DVD,"I like Nelly, but it was not what I wanted to order and was not waht the site seller said it was. Nelly's videos are Iz U, Na-na na-na, My Place, Tilt Ya Head, Call On Me, Shake Ya Tail Feather, All Night Long, Tip Drill, Over & Over, and Luv Me Baby but on the amazon page for Nelly music videos it says DVD Tracks: Country Grammar, E.I., Ride With Me, Batter Up, Hot In Herre, Dilemma, Air Force Ones, Midwest Swing, and more. Nothing about Mya. Only wanted Nelly Videos. Mya's Videos are Best of Me, Free, Ghetto Superstar, It's All About Me, Movin' On, Movin' Out, My First Night with You, Somebody Like Me, and Take Me There. Shipping was 5 star & it was 2 Day Shipping."
3,Jesus Jerusalem Map,"To see this map, you may visit the Rose Publishing website itself. It's just an ""okay"" map, in a ""3-D""-like image; not a whole lot of intersting detail. There are better maps with photos from Jerusalem bookstores."
2,Stickers,"The helmet was comfortable and such, but the stickers stretch across the top molding and did not touch the helmet in the groove. It would have been only a matter of time and the dirt, dust and other work environment items would have stuck under the sticker and loosen it. Sorry, had to return it. Maybe I'll try another type."
1,dull...........,"It may have been considered satirical science fiction in its time, but I found this limp story uneventful and quite boring. The musicians who somehow find the island are not the least bit interesting.The story is supposed to be anti-capitalism and anti ""Big Science"" but I didn't see much in the way of convincing arguments. People will always be power hungry and petty, but this doesn't necessarily mean there are limits to the good things that science and society can achieve."
3,Product Surprise,Would not play on two CD players. Does play in car. 9 more words required. 5 more words required. 1
5,Great Jazzy Blues!,"I was priviledged to see Alberta Hunter in person at the Cookery, so getting a video of one of her performances is extra special to me! I'd never heard of her before then, nor did I learn her life's story until I saw this video. She had an amazing voice and lot's of spunk for her age. If you enjoy jazzy blues, you will enjoy this video."
1,Worthless drivel,"This book is more a collection of empty platitudes (and generous whitespace) than any kind of substantive guide to improving your photography. Truly, it's not about photography -- or even the art of seeing -- at all. Not even any pictures. Sheesh. See ""Tao of Photography"" by Gross & Shapiro instead -- it's fully of nicely reproduced classic images that are well chosen to illustrate the (much more substantial) points made in the text."
2,White River Fox,"This is a terrible movie. The only reason I ordered it was because it was shot in my hometown. My children and I were extras. Thought it would be fun to find ourselves. Our shot lasted about 2 seconds. Oh well, I can say that I was in a movie with Antonio Banderas."
1,Horrible!!!,"I really had high hopes for this movie. It was filmed in my hometown and had some really big names in it. But after watching it I can honestly say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Please don't waste your money on this piece of trash, and if you see it on cable change the channel quickly!!!"
2,Zero Talent for Mimicry Ruins Daft Caper,"As a villain in his native tongue, or your well-meaning slightly gormless, salt-of-the-earth best mate, Bob Hoskins has the roles cornered. But, bless him, he hasn't a bone of mimicry in his cuddly tubby bod.This is a silly enough story as it is, further bluntened by the sort of genius miscasting that agents and studio hacks usually only dream of.Unlike their actress sisters, Brit male thespians are not known for convincing American accents. That Branagh fellow in 'Dead Again' defines the malaise. In the flop under discussion, Bob H is meant to be a cheery con-man monk from the deep south.His inability to hit a single convincing vowel is made further excruciating by the slides into dud South African or, more understandable, his native south London drawl. Painful - and Hoskins being no fool about the roles he can take, the man himself probably chafed and winced just as keenly."
4,Great item in multiples,The stackable bridge supports are very sturdy and work well. In order to stack multiple levels you will need probably at least 3 sets or more of the supports and lots of room to build. Laying out track with these is a little tricky because of the supports bigger footprint which only allow lower track to be parallel or perpendicular to the support. I use the stackable bridge supports in conjunction with the BRIO Super Supports. The Super Supports have a smaller footprint but aren't as stable. The combination works well for me.
4,Reminded me of Sarah Caudwell,"I first came across the book in London, where it was a big hit, and picked up a paperback copy. I am glad to find it in the US and hope others will too. ""London Bridges"" is a light, witty, caper (the hardest to pull off well), that reminded me of the exceptional Sarah Caudwell -- which always makes me sad to think that we no longer have more works of hers to look forward to, but I digress -- the plot is fun, thoughtfull, and more enjoyable because of the odd assotment of characters. The ending, though somewhat excessive, is a real throwback to the days of Buster Keaton and his antics. It will definitely make you laugh."
4,A pleasant romp through London and environs,"Came across this highly original British mystery while scanning the sale shelves at my local library. The story concerns a trove of valuable ancient Greek artifacts. The lawyer who handles the account for his firm realizes that the existence of the artifacts is little known to the actual owners, a monastery in Athos, Greece. He slowly becomes drawn into a plot to acquire some of the treasures for himself. The plot itself, while original, is not the sole point of interest of the novel. Ms. Stevenson has drawn a fascinating, diverse set of characters, and several gripping subplots. Lots of local color - she takes you by the hand to a number of interesting locations in and around London. While the story is slow in unfolding, and not high in action, the book is a rewarding read, both for its vivid characterizations and an original premise."
2,Read Margery Allingham instead,"This was a great let down. It is evidently an attempt to write a modern multi-cultural PC version of Margery Allingham's great London detective stories ('Tiger in the Smoke' 'The China Governess' and 'Hide My Eyes') but it fails. One of the child characters in 'The China Governess' is introduced into the novel as an adult and is an assembly of cliches.The sense of London, so profound and chilling in Allingham's work is lost and the presentation of the city is shallow and indeed journalistic. Worse, there are authorial interventions ventriloquised via certain approved characters which read like op-ed pieces for the Independent newspaper. I'd recommend that readers try Allingham rather than Stevenson."
2,Suprisingly amateurish,"I was surprised at just how poorly written this humorless little book is. Ms. Stevenson is an established author and a professor, so it pains me to say that London Bridges has the distinct whiff of Creative Writing 101. Perhaps she is trying to prove a point about the state of British publishing by passing off one of her students' fumbling attempts as a real book. The plot could be very interesting, but is completely undermined by laughable dialogue and cartoonish characters. Though I am glad I only checked it out from the library, the 25 cent late fee was perhaps too much to pay for this slush pile dreck."
3,A little dry,"This is an ambitious book, taking the theme of six degrees of separation, that we are all (at least in a big city like London) linked to eachother through strangers. It also attempts to show how several contemporary London characters are linked to history and to other cultures.Don't get me wrong, Ms Stevenson can write crisp dialogue and does excellent characterizations. But (I read on the cover blurb) she is an academic and boy does it show. Couldn't she think of anything less dry than some mind bogglingly dull plot about a fight for the land rights of an old church? All the legal stuff is gone into in great detail and she spends many pages describing the history of every house, tower and square of pavement in the story. Sorry, but having an excellent knowledge of history does not make a city come alive and I wonder why she put this extraneous detail in.So I skim read most of it ... I await her next book, because she is a talented writer. If only she could loosen up a bit."
4,purple cover edition,"The book itself is great, if challenging. It loses a star for the cheap binding of this edition. As soon as I opened the book, I was fearful of it falling apart. I would invest in a more expensive copy to this book. One whose manufacturer respected the book as the classic that it is."
5,Good review for Montessori,"I bought this to help educate myself on the Montessori Method as I am now teahing music in a Montessori school. This is a very good text, summary of the whole approach. Highly recommended!"
4,Enjoyable DVD!,"I have been using this DVD for home yoga workouts for over a year now, and I still love it. It's not as good as a class, but it's a pretty good alternative. I like that there are plenty of options for practitioners of every level. I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who doesn't have time to make it to the gym for a class."
5,Happy Mama Happy Baby,"Great, great, great book. I've recommended it to several friends already. I love that he emphasizes the importants of seeing your child for who they are and not trying to hammer them into a certain mold. I have had a great time getting to know the little person that God has placed in my care. I also appreciated how much he points out that more is caught than taught and reminds me that our children will ""follow me and I follow Christ"". Again, I would recommend this book hands down."
1,What trash! Don't waste your time.,"First, there's the main character, a brillant and beautiful doctor, a veteran ex-POW, who is also a single mother (her equally brillant doctor-husband was killed in a tragic car accident). It follows that her daughter is precocious and charms every adult that comes into her force field. Could Mortman layer on any more sap! Yes, she can and does. Then, of course, there is the equally talented lawyer who joins her estranged mother's company and who just happened to have been her lover while they were both stationed in Kuwait during the first Gulf War. Her father, a highly decorated Army officer, now runs a top-flight security firm that is hired to protect her mother (his ex-wife). It turns out that the antagonist served with the brillant and beautiful doctor & lawyer in the Gulf War and... Well, it gets worse from that point on.Don't waste your time."
3,Needed better description,"I understand that this was a used copy, but I wish I had been told that it was a former library copy. It had labels on each of the disks and the disks were very scratched. I needed this for a specific purpose and I would not have purchased this copy if I had known about the scratches and the labels. Shipping was quick."
3,Shades of Red,"Shades of Red was a great mystery book and was very exciting. Doris Mortman did a good job describing the characters, and showing you their point of view. Throughout the book you expect someone from Vera's company to contaminate the lipstick. But while you read the book, your murder suspect changes. At the end of the book i was shocked to find out who the real murder was. One thing i didnt like, was how the beginning of the book was really slow. It took a long time for me to get into the book."
1,Pure schlock,"My mother recommended this writer, and Mom is usually right on the mark, so I was shocked by this soap opera mishmash. Every character is a stereotype. We have the gorgeous movie-star, her handsome ex-husband the general, two sisters who hate each other, the perfect child, the hillbilly with a heart of gold. They are all here. I tried reading the book, but couldn't get past the first chapter, so I thought I'd try the audio book. That was even worse. The dialogue is embarrassing and the writing sounds even worse read out loud. The author must be a frustrated interior decorator, because every room the characters find themselves in rates a detailed description from the carpeting to the wallpaper. Even if you have a long commute, as I do, this book is a waste of time. I finished it because I figured out the ""mystery"" midway through and wanted my suspicions confirmed. I was right."
1,Chips? Why aren't these in sticks as they usually are?,I have bought better selection of colors in full sticks for about the same price - I can't imagine working with chips - the process of sumi is grinding down the pigments and I don't know how you can do that properly with chips
1,America Haters rejoice,"Another hatchet job by the folks who hate the administration.Yes, let us just allow the Islamists to destroy our country.Do you relly think that we can prevent other 911s simply by""being nice?""We must use the most extreme tools at our disposal to root out the enemy.They are here.They hate us and want to kill us.Wake up!Jessica et al are simply tools of CAIR."
3,A little disappointing,"I am a big Gomez fan. Their first three studio albums have revived my respect for modern rock and roll. That said, I think ""Split the Difference"" is not in the same category for quality and inspiration. If you are looking for your first foray into Gomez, try ""Bring It On"", ""Liquid Skin"", or ""In My Gun"". They are much better in my opinion.There are some good tracks on the new album but they are mixed into a bunch that seem to be the band searching for a new sound or trying to sound more commercially acceptable.Again, Gomez is one of the best new bands I have heard in many years; just don't start here if you're new to them."
5,excellent,"I have been a huge fan from the first album, after hearing ""Split"" about 20 times now I have to say it may be my favorite of all of them.They really mix it up on this one.If I have one critism, it sounds like they were trying for a radio hit and I think they may have a few on this CD.I highly recommend this cd!!!!!!!!"
1,"Save your money, pick a few songs to download","Real quick review: The album opens up with 2 solid tracks, then derails. Very little of the great vocals and and musical creativity that defined their previous two studio albums. This one will soon be filed away next to my other Gomez cds, and won't make it to the home or car player for a long time to come. Yeah, I know 1 star is harsh, but someone needed to balance out the number of glowing reviews. (FYI my musical tastes range from Ben Folds Five to Floyd to Slayer.)"
3,What?!,"Is it Pearl Jam or Dave Mathews? Since neither are favorites of mine, neither is Gomez. I liked ""Sweet Virginia"". The Beatlesque ""Extra Special Guy"" wasn't too bad, but I still found most of the tracks kind of boring, bubble gum hippy rock - an offshoot of other groups I was never fond of. And who said these guys sound like the Dead? What?! Check out Brandt Bjork and the Operators if you need some real rock n roll."
3,"Lord, They Were Born a Rambling Band","Gomez's bluesy Americana has always been out of place on the Britrock scene. True, it has antecedents - The Faces, Humble Pie, even Oasis fer chris'sakes. But somewhere between their grainy vocal presence and jamming psychedelica they've always felt forced - a cut-rate Dead for the new millennium. Split the Difference couldn't be better named. They have the right producer in Tchad Blake (Latin Playboys; Tom Waits). He anchors their escapades with a bottom-heavy rumble that lets them stretch out on a thrasher like ""We Don't Know Where We're Going"" or hook a sly groove as on ""Meet Me in the City"". Perhaps because they've been doing it over four releases now there isn't such a heady whiff of retro (even though Split the Difference is their rootsiest move yet). Yet Lord, they were born a rambling band. Now they're a pretty damn good one."
4,Prediction,"I always liked Gomez from the first time I heard Liquid Skin, but it wasn't until Memphis in May last year that I realized that they truly rock...This album is very true to their live sound, and I was jammin' to this album from start to finish, with only a couple mis-steps.I predict that following their tour playing the mainstage at Lollapalooza this year, where they will rock the crowds and find hordes of new fans, these guys are gonna get big. I suggest you buy their albums now so you'll always be able to say ""I was with 'em before the mainstream took hold.""This album is really cool... it rocks hard and eclectically throughout."
1,Do it Fiberglass Hoe,"The handle is to short unless your under 5 ft tall. The metal part of the hoe bends. The description did not represent the Hoe that I received. Do not buy ""Do it Fiberglass Hoe"" unless you are 5ft or less in height working in soft dirt."
4,Where Where You When The Lights Went Out?,"OVERLOAD by Linda HowardBlackout! The entire Southeast was without power - but there was still more than enough electricity between Elizabeth Major and Tom Quinlan! They were stranded together in a Dallas high rise for the duration - and setting off enough sparks to light up the darkest night.HOT COPY by Carole BuckHotshot newswriters Mitch Nelson and CHristy Kavanaugh had loved their way through the big blackout of 1977. So imagine their surprise when they were reunited to cover the great lights-out of '93. All thoughts of keeping things cool were doused along with the lights!STEAM BATH by Suzanne CareyThe elevator didn't work and neither did the air-conditioning, so prim-and-proper Melisande Taylor was stuck in a sweaty office with the man not of her dreams - sex, irritating Joe Carbone. And Joe had a lot more on his mind than passing the time with boring conversation..."
2,Non-Fiction,"A very old fashioned style in this book.It gives a history of the world cup from the early days, and the various politics and arguments surrounding where the games should be, who should play, etc.A long time ago in a very different world when it was immensely difficult to travel long distance, and the players themselves weren't pampered substance abusing multimillionaires, from Germany to England to Uruguay or wherever the games were played."
2,Not worth it for your bucks...,"I usually don't write reviews, but I had to for this one. I was really excited about getting this toaster oven regardless of the reviews, good or bad. It was a good deal and I just couldn't resist, now I'm really disappointed. It's a nice toaster oven and it's work, but the only thing I'm unsatified about is the noise. Tick, tick, tick...everytime I turned it on - really annoying."
4,"Good value, seems to work well","This is a decent toaster over. It's nothing fancy, but it's not too big and it functions well. The slide-out crumb tray is just a tray that sits on the bottom of the unit and it doesn't catch everything, but it's a reasonable, cheap solution.Easy to operate."
4,thumb up,Over all a great realiable prodct with a timer/alarm feature to notify when it is done. The only minor drawback is the surface is too hot to touch when in/after operation.
1,Poor quality,"Bought this about two years ago....and it did not survive that long.It was very flimsy to start, so I figured it would not last very long.This was my second Proctor Silex toaster oven and would not buy again."
4,"Solid and sturdy, it does what you want a toaster oven to do.","Broil, toast and bake. Those are the three things I look for my toaster to do. It does all of them just fine. I like the bottom crumb pan which helps to keep those nasty burnt crumobs from ruining your toaster."
4,a pretty good buy,"I like this toaster oven a lot. The price was great, especially since I buy a new one when the old one gets too gross to clean and therefore prefer to buy cheap ones. This oven has a removable crumb tray which should help me keep it clean longer. Other reviews mentioned a ""ticking"" noise. I only notice this noise when I am standing near the toaster oven and am listening for it. The top doesn't get very hot and four slices of bread fit inside nicely. The only thing I don't like is the door. There is no catch for the door, so it just slams to the counter if I don't catch it."
1,Too hot to handle,"The back and top got so hot that they could not be touched, which worried me that overheating could occur if someone placed anything on top of the unit (a hot mitt or cookbook) or even pushed it against the wall too tightly. Because of concern for use by children and/or fire hazard, I had to return this item."
3,TOASTER OVENS: ANOTHER REASON WHY CAPITALISM SUCKS.,Since toaster ovens are cheap it seems there have to be as few resources as possible devoted to designing and producing them - gotta keep up those profit margins. This one does an excellent job of exemplifying this. It works but is basically crappy in every way. I love toast so I am disturbed that there doesn't seem to be an affordable toaster oven that does a fast good job of toasting out there.
1,noise makers,"Hello,Both the Proctor Silex 31115 4-Slice Toaster Oven/Broiler and the Proctor Silex 31117 4-Slice Toaster Oven/Broiler make noise when in use.Both products make audible sounds when in use. It sounds like this; tick, tick, tick, tick, tick..."
1,Don't Buy This if You Value Your Hearing,I returned this after using it one time.The toaster works only with a very loud ticking timer.No way to toast without the ticking sound.So loud that I returned it.Be forewarned!
1,Don't Buy it,This toaster is the worst I ever have bought.The performance is terrible. Not worst the money.It burns everything. Bad design.
3,Casio CW-L300 Label-Biz Disc Title Printer with Qwerty Keyboard,"This product was a disappointment because the labelling on the product said that it can print logos -- which is the sole reason why we bought it. When we received the product and read the owner's manual, we learned that the only logos it could print were the ones that come with the machine -- not custom logos that we wanted to download from our computer. Failure to have this detail labelled on the packaging or in the Amazon.com description has caused us alot of inconvenience.As soon as we realized this about the product, we returned it to Amazon.com, so we did not test the actual performance of the product."
1,Very frustrating to setup and jammed immediately,"It is not possible to get the label software to run without crashing under Windows XP SP2; wasted several hours trying to make it work. Downloaded the updates from Casio's website but the application still would not start or would start and immediately crash. Had to install Windows 2000 under VMWare and finally I could get the software would run. However I was not able to print to the device (even though it had installed correctly).To make matters worse, even in manual mode the cartridge ink ribbon jammed on the first try. Tried a different cartridge and it also jammed. Returned it for another and exactly the same issue occurred. This product is terrible! I finally gave up and purchasedBrother PT-1950 Desktop 5-Line PC-Ready Labelerinstead."
2,Used to be great,"I have used this device for three years. It used to run great under Windows XP. I have now upgraded to Windows 7 64bit edition. This device does NOT work with a 64bit OS. I contacted Casio support and asked if there would be 64bit drivers. They stated there would not be and their ""solution"" was for me to install a 32bit OS and dual boot. Sorry, I'm not going through the hassle for one device. All my other peripherals have 64bit drivers. This device should, too. I consider that answer Customer Disservice.UPDATE: Enough owners must have complained. There are now 64bit Windows 7 drivers. Works fine with my setup."
4,"So far, so good","I carefully researched all of the different products similar to this one before I chose the Bra Ball. I have used a lingerie bag for quite some time, but have never been happy with the twisting that can sometimes occur. This works very well - my only complaint is that I have to bend the wires in my underwire bra for them to fit in (""C"" cup bras). I worry that it could break the wire over time, but we'll see. It fits easily into my washing machine and keeps the padded bras looking like new. One quick note that a couple of people have mentioned here: the paperwork that comes with the product mentions that the ball will fade to white in color over time. I don't think that is due to coloring coming off, but because of the beating the plastic takes in the washing machine - if you bend any plastic (like a credit card) repeatedly, it turns white!"
1,too small to be useful,"Most of my bras are B cup, the largest one I have is 38 ""nearly C"", and I would have to bend the underwires or mash the molded cups to fit any of them in it. Maybe a perfect sphere is not the right shape."
4,"Great, but hard to open",This is a great product. it really protects the shape of underwire bras. The only downsides are it is difficult to open and very loud in the dryer.
2,Bras don't fit!,"This would be GREAT if my bras fit into it. I only wear a C/D and can't even fit one in. I'd really like a product that protects my bras this well as opposed to mesh bags, even those with some padding in the bag don't keep them from being crushed in the wash. But they need to make a MUCH larger size."
5,it's a miracle; why is it such a secret??,"i splurged on this weird ball shaped thing on a whim and because of the raving reviews. i was almost suspicious of all the reviews even. after the first wash with an expensive push-up victoria's secret bra resulted in a spotless & in original shape bra, my suspicions were allayed and i am now a serious fan. holy smokes, this item seriously needs more publicity. i've also discovered a new secret gift for my fellow ladies. please feel free to ask questions. this thing fit into our stackable washer. screw handwashing!!!"
1,Too BIG,Couldn't even give it a try !!The ball is so big that didn't fit my washing machine!Waste of money !!!
2,my bras dont fit,"I wear Victoria's Secret 36B level 5 padded underwires, and the ball, although a good idea, is not the right shape to hold a bra. I had to jam mine in, thus bending the underwires to fit, and at $53 a pop, i'm not willing to risk my bras in this thing. Sorry Phan, I had to be truthful in my review..."
2,larger chest,"I can see how this product would be helpful but, having a larger chest, my bra does not fit on the ball without the underwires sticking out. The outer shell will not close, therefore it is unusable for me."
2,Disappointed with product and vendor,"I ordered this product with high hopes of never having to wash my underwire bras by hand again. First disappointment: Phastastic Innovations took two weeks to deliver the item, with no communication about a delay in shipping. When I contacted them to ask about delivery, I was told that they were having staffing problems. The braball is hard to open unless you figure out the ""trick."" But my bras didn't fit (I wear a 34D) and I had to squish one in to try the braball the first time. Second disappointment: When I opened it up after the wash, the foam padding in the bra had cracked...ruining a perfectly good bra. When I wrote to complain about the product, I received no reply from Phastasic and yesterday decided to return it. Who knows if I'll even get a refund, but the product didn't work for me."
2,Save your cash...,"I bought this product and am very unhappy with it...It is unwieldy to open and close...especially when there are bras inside it...They advertise that you can fit up to three bras in it...Yeah right...I'm a large B or a small C cup and one bra barely fits inside this thing...It's awkward, but does protect bras in the wash...IF YOU CAN GET THEM INTO IT..."
3,"Tide bra bag works just as well, for a fraction of the price!","This product works pretty well. However, I recently found a much cheaper alternative that is just as good - the Tide bra bag. For under $5, each bra bag holds two bras and will give you clean bras in perfect condition. Since the bra bags are made of fabric, they also don't clunk around loudly in the washing machine. Save your money and stick with Tide."
3,In Shape!,"It definitely kept my bras in shape and I could get two 36B with padding in this, but it also took up a lot of room in my washer."
2,Not very useful,"The idea is good, but it's not that useful. It is too big for a lot of washers, also it will make damage to the dryer."
3,Good concept but too small,"Good concept but far to small - A 38DD does not fit into this device- the bra sticks out so the ball can't be closed, thus it can't be used - it needs to be securely snapped closed to function. I would buy and happily use and recommend this if it was available in a larger size."
1,Great concept but product breaks,"I loved my bra balls. But all three that I have owned have broken in the washer. I paid for two balls and one was replaced under warranty. After the one that was replaced under warranty broke, the company would not replace again. After contacting the owner for another replacement. This is the response I received.""No, the replacement is not cover by the warrantee. No business in world would ever do that. In fact I am not even supposed to offer you the discount. I did it to make you happy."""
3,Tangled Straps,"I think I was one of the first to own one of these bra savers. I LOVE IT! Lately though, I can't seem to get the straps to stay inside the little ball? Do I hook the bra inside the small ball? Drives me crazy cause when wash is done my bra straps have escaped the big ball and tangled and tied themselves in half of my clothing! 20 min later my bra straps and some of my clothes are stretched and tangled beyond belief. ERR, gets me so irritated that I can't get this bra machine to work properly!Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!Thank You, :)"
4,"Works Wonderfully, but...","I ordered the braball a while ago, and it worked great! All my padded bras come out of the wash undamaged and clean. The only thing that I was upset about was that the plastic broke after long(about 1yr-- I do a lot of loads of laundry though. An average of 2 per week) continued usage so the ball didn't stay closed in the wash anymore. I have to order another one now, maybe two!"
1,BraBall from Amazon,"Don't waste your money. I am a B/C cup and my bra will not fit. It is difficult to open and close, and doesn't go in the dryer so you have to hang to dry anyways. I bought the Dual bra wash bag from Amazon for $5.99 and it works great in the washer and dryer."
5,Bought for someone else,"I bought one of these for my significant other, and due to knowing she could safely wear nicer bras, she started wearing and purchasing nicer bras. One of my best gift ideas ever. Absolutely."
3,Protects bras but sometimes it opens up in washer,I purchased this product to protect the padding on my bras in the washer. It's done a great job. Unfortunately it sometimes opens up in the washer and I can only use it for one bra at a time.
2,"Good idea, poor reality","I really, really wanted to like this. So I ignored the reviews that said it was too small. But I only wear a 34B and my bras don't quite fit - they get a bit crushed (which really defeats the purpose). Plus, I can't open it. My hands are a touch on the weak side, and my husband has to do it for me. I had such high hopes for this but sadly, it just doesn't work."
4,love it!,"This is just what I have been looking for. It is hard to open at first but once you get the hang of it, it's fine. I would rather it be a hard open then have it open during washing. If it was just a bit larger, it would be perfect."
2,Very difficult to open,"I purchased this from Amazon about a month ago and am very unhappy with this product. While the concept is good, the product doesn't hold up. Maybe I received a defective ball, but it is extremely hard to open up!!!! I had to use a hammer the other day to open the ball. Very frustrated ~ not only do I have an defective product, I lost 25.00."
4,"Pricey, but BraBall works","BraBall costs more than the competition, but it does work & doesn't snag the bra fabric like some others do. It seems quite sturdy."
4,"Great product, not the best for D-cups","overall i am very pleased with the BraBall--much, MUCH better than the imitations, by far. that said though, my 34-D bras really dont fit too well, mainly because of the underwire. i can manage to get them in, but some types of bras stick out between the seal, making the ball hard to open because the material is somewhat stuck. still, i use it every time, and it has yet to open in the wash as a few reviews have mentioned.my suggestion for bigger-boobed women, go ahead and get this if you dont mind spending the money, but then write the BraBall people a letter and ask for them to start drawing up plans for size D and DD. our bras are expensive, we'd like to protect ours as well!"
5,"This is the real deal, don't buy the cheap imitation!","The Bra Ball works great! It keeps my bra in place within the ball, unlike some other less expensive imitations of this product."
4,"Nice plate, but not as nicely articulated as others in the BIA line-up","I have a number of BIA Cordon Bleu pieces, and I recently purchased this item during Amazon's 70% off kitchen sale. A great price at 1 buck 50 per piece on sale.I love the colors, which is why I picked them up. The design is a bit crude (as pictured) and not as nicely articulated as other BIA plates (which can be viewed at Amazon). But I'm keeping them. I'll use these as party platesw ~ suitable for appetizers, cheese & crackers, desserts.Plate size is actually 6.75"", not 7"", if that matters to you.Made in China."
3,"Addictive, but too many pieces","As other reviewers have stated about any of these sets, my daughters play with them for hours. They love them! However, I really think some of the extra super-tiny pieces are unnecessary for young children. I've only had one of these sets for a few months and already some of the pieces are missing. At first, I supervised their play, but I don't have time to do that often. As soon as the supervision ceased, pieces ended up missing or scattered. I was sort of frustrated about that because I spent money on this. And if your child wants other furniture sets, it gets to be a small fortune! My eldest daughter has the Elephant family and the twins and has kept all the pieces intact. However, she's seven. With my youngest, I have to come right behind her with Ziploc bags to gather the very tiny pieces. Five or older is a more appropriate age for these kinds of toys. I even think the Calico Critters and all their pieces is perfect for a collector, someone who is not a child."
5,Very Cute!,this is too cute! I love the little mobile and all the accessories. I think Calico critters makes a great product. I just wish it was less money.
3,"It's ""okay""","The crib mobile does NOT stay together....especially for small hands or adult hands! The other items are okay, but all so very small my 4 y/os don't play with them."
4,Tons of Accessories and Playtime Fun,"My nickname as a child was 'little bits' because I loved things in miniature. This set delivers working parts and details that are nicely done. My daughter loves having a place for her baby critters to play and hang out.There are lots of accessories including a play mat with working parts, slide, feeding chair with plate and spoon, a crib with a movable side rail, dresser/wardrobe with pull out drawers, real material crib linens and even a mobile.As with other Calico Critter sets, there are paper things that are supposed to be toy boxes and other stuff but they are really pretty worthless.A fun set for your critter's nursery."
1,not what offerd,BAK TGPC52 ProCaps Truck Bed Rail CapThis not Bed cap rails is 77 in. (6 ft. 4.9 in.) it is the the tail gate cap not the sides rails like it said. very disappointed and amazon was no help at all
2,Listing not clear!!!,"The ad clearly states 'Matching tailgate cap available"" this causes confusion. Makes you think the sale is for the side rail caps. Not the case, what I got was a tailgate cap, had to return it"
2,Disappointing unbalanced view of life,"This book was a depressing survey of how women perceive that they are slighted by men. The characters in this book (and the author herself?) blame men for every bad thing that happens to them and on earth, for that matter, rather than taking responsiblity for their own destiny. After reading this book, I had the distinct impression that the author, Marilyn French, hates men and is bent on telling the world about it. Unrealistically, each male character in the book was portrayed as unsympathetic if not downright evil. While there are certainly unkind and bad men in the world, this unbalanced view of life made the author lose credibility. I know that Marilyn French is a well-known author of women's books, but I would never read anything by her again. (By the way, I am female.)"
3,Okay CD,"This CD is okay, but once you have heard one song you have heard them all. The music gets a little repetitive, and Arianna has a bit of heaviness in her voice that I do not personally like. It is a nice CD, but not one that I would listen to over and over again."
4,knife shaprening slystem,System works very well and knives are sharp when sharpening is complete. I does take some practice to develop a techinque. Well worth the price if you have the better quality of kitchen knives. Tjhe serrated sharpening stone rather difficul and time consuming to use.
4,Sharp,Lansky is a good system to get your knife edges precise. Serrated knives are especially difficult and this does a good job. The downside is that it can be awkward to use.
2,Poorly shaped hone,This hone is not well designed for contemporary serration cut designs. I have not been able to identify a serration design on any tactical/combat/fighting/survival knives currently on the market.
4,Works Great but doesn't come with file holder.....,"...so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand, not to safe. Missing file holder is the only reason I don't give it five stars."
1,Poor use,This item is very badly done and is not as easy to use as it seems. The knives do not get sharper and it really is odd to use and not well made at all. Amazon has much better sharpeners avalible I totally regret getting this one. It gets one star because there is no zero stars.
4,The begining made the book what it was.,The poetic begining of the book was the best part. I especially liked the way Forrestor used the displays to describe human nature. Foresstor has tremendous insight into human nature; maybe only the pessimistic side. I thoughthe was long winded when he got into his own views. But then again that is my own opion.
5,Beautiful brass finish.,Solid brass fixture that is very well made. It met more than my expectations. The fixture is very easy to install.
3,Rebecca Gayheart is wonderful,"Becouse I love Rebecca Gayheart, every movie i watch is good.This one is about a plumber (David) that really wants to get a good reputation. He gives a good friend ""whos in the movie business"" free plumbing. His friend lets him pretend to be a director, so the girls would fall for him. But the script that he ""stole"" from a another friend were terrific. People liked it alot. So the word spread and the script became movie material. So now David has to direct the movie but he has no experience. Hes just a plumber!And he wants Rebecca Gayheart so much so he lets her star in the movie. But he cant get intimite with her, couse that will mess everything up. But he cant wait untill the movie is over...Sorry for my bad English"
3,Interesting movie,This was an interesting movie that left somethings unexplained or explained badly. It was a decent mystery that had a lot of obvious clues but it is still a good childrens movie that most adults would enjoy.
1,Buy Or Not To Buy Is That The Question,Buy it if you are under six years old or if you are very dispreite and you live with your mother when you are over 40 years of age. Do Not Buy Do Not Buy! (...)
5,Required Text,Needed this for a course at PSU and couldn't get it. Amazon came to the rescue! Thanks! Great Service as usual!!
4,Ms Bassey is still on top,This CD blew me away when I heard it. All of her hits have been remixed or remastered and the results are outstanding. Even some of the songs which weren't the best when released take on a new life in this collection. A must have for every Shirley Bassey fan. I now haveboth the British and American versions of the greatest hits package as they are very different.
5,Shirley Bassey - The Goldsinger,"What Now My Love, Where Do I Begin? This cd is absolutely fantastic! Shirley has an amazing voice & you can tell by the way she sings, that singing is her passion. All of her ""Bond"" hits are here, along with many other treasures. ""History Repeating"" is simply a Classic song and when you hear it, you might just find yourself doing some funky dance straight out of the 60's. The remixes are great and I especially like the ""Big Spender"" remix. For those of you who love to lip-sync Divas, you will not find yourself short of material with this CD. Every song is a classic ""performance"", especially ""This Is My Life"". This cd from the Beautiful & Stunning Ms. Bassey (just check out the pictures from the liner notes) is truly worth the price of admission!"
2,Shirley Bassey,I was disapointed in this CD---I had the original in an album form many years ago and this was not the same as her Album Shirley Bassey's Greatest Hits. Two of the songs were repeated and in the original album This Is My Life was from a Live Concert the CD version was not LIVE - I would not reccommed this CD
2,Timeless,"Ms.Shirley Bassey is what you can call timeless, you can be in your 60's, 30's or be a teenager and still love her. She is absolutelly talented and genereously gifted it is always quite an experience listening to her singing. And she is also tuned to the changings without loosing her identity see what she did with the Propeller heads on History Repeating, it is amazing. Viva miss Shirley Bassey!"
3,Shirley Bassey CD,"I received the CD on time and in excellent condition. I did not, however, like some of the songs on the CD."
5,Shirley Bassey - The Greatest Hits,"If you love strong vocals, you can't miss with Ms. Bassey. I fell in love with her music the first time she sang a theme from the James Bond 007 series. Every song is a hit! You won't be sorry with this purchase."
5,GREAT VOICE !,"Barry, you are nuts ! Shirley Bassey has a powerful voice, and has the range, you idiot. Learn to have an appreciation of music before you write a review. Her voice is incredibly rich and sensual. Just listen to ""Big Spender"", ""Diamonds are Forever"", and ""Moonraker"", which are full to the brim with red-hot desire, and these are just 3 of her songs. In ""This is my Life"", one can feel all of this woman's passion, energy, and pride. How can one not feel uplifted, after hearing such a voice ? For those who like intense voices, try the greatest opera singer Maria Callas. I strongly recommend it."
2,Poor Design,"I owned two Raketa 24 hr watches. Moisture would quickly collect within the watch, causing it to seize and rendered the watch useless. The problem is that the face is not quarts, water easily enters the watch causing it to NEVER WORK AGAIN."
5,Step up your sewing...teach yourself TAILORING!,"I researched and decided to buy 3 tailoring books to teach myself how to. This was one of them. First time out, I made a knockout tiger striped short blazer with black lapels with an understructure that makes it hang just as perfectly as I planned. It knocked people OUT!Learn to tailor! Dollar for dollar, it's really worth sewing: tailored jackets are a high-priced retail item that totally pays for you to make yourself!"
2,Kindle Version and Didn't like this,"As a cooking book reference this wasn't what I wanted, I eventually deleted this off my Kindle. I'm not an expert in electronic books, however its very hard to print and page of this from a Kindle."
3,gave it away,not very practical at all. I ended up giving it to a friend who I dont think got much use out of it either...
4,good solid Jam,"the mixes were cool here.i really dug Brownstone it's sad that they had to break up because they were a solid Vocal Group.""Grapevne"" is a good track.""the mix for ""Pass The Lovin"",is good here as well."
4,Ladies and gentlemen... Woody Allen.,"This is a reissue of a 1972 double album that reissued Woody Allen's three comedy albums on two records. The first album was recorded in 1964 at Mr. Kelly's in Chicago. The second album was recorded in 1965 at The Shadows in Washington, D.C. The last album was recorded in 1968 at Eugene's in San Francisco. This is an excellent document of Woody Allen's early years as a standup comedian. And it's funny, too. The recording quality isn't really the best, though. And the transitions between the three different shows are sometimes awkward, especially when it switches from the earlier mono shows to the later stereo show. The two discs here are split into four parts which are 20 or so minutes long each, duplicating the four sides of the original double album. Most of the material here is quite funny, with Allen playing a similar persona to the one he played in his early films. Allen's fan's will definitely enjoy this."
5,Great follow up,"You don't need to read the predcessor of this book to enjoy it, but you might as well. This is book is great from start to finish. It is thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Snoozefest,"Huh? Did we all read the same book? I rarely do reviews on books that I didn't like, but I'll make an exception in this case. I've enjoyed many of Stark's books....really enjoy Parker's escapades and no nonsense way, but I think he kind of slept through this one. This is a very short read about one heist. The reader is forced to read through every little detail about the job, including road directions that you could actually follow, directions that are often repeated. Details are important to flesh out mission impossible style plots, but this is a very basic armored car take-down at an out of the way cafe. The adjoining plot has more potential, but never really builds up any suspense or momentum. There is a daily bathroom break for someone Parker has ""on ice"", and that's real exciting too. This is a short story stretched out to novel proportions. Very disappointing..........had to force myself to finish it. Won't stop reading Stark, but will research future purchases better."
5,a sweet little crime novel..,"'The Man with the Getaway Face"" is the perfect sort of easy, short read that would be perfect for the beach or on the train. In essence a ragtag team of bunglers plan the robber of an armored vehicle. The author does a stellar job with the dialogue and characterizations of these losers. Some things go right, most things go wrong. People are killed w/o graphic drama. And the chief mug, Parker, somehow carries on; he is a likeable low life.What I like best about this book is how economical it is. No wasted words, no literary excess whatsoever. The author, who is extremely well published under various aliases, has written some duds. But this book is not among them.Bottom line: sometimes good things come in small packages. Recommended."
4,Fun series,I bought this as the second book in the Parker novel series for my boyfriend and he loves it. If you've read any of the others this one won't disappoint.
2,Not as good,"I loved the first book in the Knights of the Silver Dragon series, so I quickly ordered the second one. But this one did not have nearly the same amount of excitement and D&D-esque sense of adventure from the first book. I don't think I'll be getting the third one."
1,Bad design w/ screw band attatchment,"I have had this watch fall off my arm in a busy intersection and again it just fell off my arm sitting at my desk at work. The screws that hold the band onto the watch keep untightning.I have had the watch for 4 months and do not wear it daily because I have a collection of watches. The screws were unavailable at target the first time they fell out. Had to order them from Timex. Now again I have to call Timex to have the screws shipped. Took 4 weeks. I plan to throw this watch away and invest only in craftman workman ship on all next watch purchases. Alway been happy with Timex, but this one is a bad seed."
3,I brought this for my boyfriend.,"I just got this for my boyfriend and he loved it. He said its nice and sleak, but he didn't like the color, i have to admit target does'nt exactly have all the right stuff on their site nor in their store, but its a good place to buy cheap stuff."
1,Worst Timex ever,My wife got this watch for me. I like the style and fit. It would lose time. Several minutes a week. The battery died just after a couple of months. I tried replacing the battery but once you remove the paper thin flimsy back you will never get it back on. I sent it back for repair and they sent a new watch. I thought hey great service. Well a few months later it began losing time again and then the minute hand fell off completely. It sits in a drawer at home. I haven't decided whether or not I will bother repairing it again. I am wearing my cheap $30 Casio there never loses more than a second in a month or more.
4,Suprisingly good,"This cd contains tracks some of which were not released on the Images of Twilight cd and some which were on it. The tracks which weren't on the Images Lp are Half the time, old man, hangman, don't step out of line, and don't bother. Half the time is very good song, kind of dreamy in parts..I give it a 7.5 out fo 10 rating, old man is another good song 7 of 10, hangman is dark but good 7.5 of 10, don't step out of line is the song which could have best fit Images out of these song 8 of 10, don't bother is comical 6 of 10. The version of mouse in a maze on here is better than the one on the Images cd. All in all this cd is better than two or three full cd's they have done. The songs aren't really outakes more than they were songs that didn't fit on the Images Lp at the time."
5,Great Tribute to a Great Lady,"I love the songs John chose to include in this album. His choice of performers is excellent, too."
2,Meh,"I didn't mind the song selections, and the artists are certainly distinguished enough, but the covers weren't very good. ""Wildwood Flower"" is pretty good and Loretta Lynn is a good type to record it, except that it repeated verses all over the place (as filler?). But Ronnie Dunn and Carlene Carter managed to suck all the soul out of ""Jackson""; it's all noise and no real heat. Elvis Costello clearly had no idea what to do with ""Ring of Fire"". Doing to song justice should be more important than making it different."
3,Good but inconsistent,This is a nice album for fans of June Carter Cash but the selection of artists and songs is a little ragged. So while I enjoy this title I know that with a different artist or two and an alternate sound this could have been wonderful.
1,Anchored In Love CD,There were not enough of June Carter Cash's most popular songs and too few well known artist. I was very disappointed with it.
5,It's Heavenly hilarious!,"(from Christopher, age 8) Angels Don't Know Karate is a very nice book 'cause Melody is the only one who thinks the new JPO is an angel. She thinks so because when Angela was catching Eddie when he was falling down from the oak tree, it looked like she had wings sticking out under her cape. The best part was when Melody and her friends were trying to make friends with mean Mr. Manson. You should read this book. I love ALL the Bailey books!"
3,This book is agreat book because it has a great adventure in,"This book is so cool, 'cause it shows that some things are true even if you don't believe it . You should read this book, it's a great book to read!"
3,"Good, fast paced biography of ""Oppie""","I agree with all reviewers of this book. It's quickly paced and is written for the Readers Digest type crowd. It doesn't go into specifics about the physics behind the bomb. The book presents a fair-minded review of Oppie's life and his association's with the Communist party. The book does a good job of allowing us to see that the US government was caught up in the hysteria of the times by disallowing access of Oppenheimer to further nuclear secrets. He was simply stating his opposition to the creation of the H-bomb...and labelled a Communist because of it. The book does a good job of showing how despicable Edward Teller was to further himself at the expense of Oppie. I give it three stars simply because I didn't find it to be a page-turner...but a good, steady read."
5,Robert Oppenheimer,"After reading ""Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic story"" I felt that I knew Mr. Oppenheimer. The author wrote the book so that all the information could be learned and still be interesting. I learned every little fact about Mr. Oppenheimer and came out with a greater appreciation for him and his work.The reason he is worthy of a book is mostly because he was the man behind the atomic bomb. He is most famous for this but he also accomplished many other great things in nuclear fission and quantum physics.I started reading this book because I had to but after reading it I gained an appreciation and a greater understanding for a great man. If you are doing a report or are just interested in Robert Oppenheimer I strongly suggest that you read this book."
3,Fun but suction cups don't work!,"The babies love the toy but it arrived packed in such a way that the suction cups were completely bent out of shape and therefore do not work at all! I ended up sending it back as I had bought it to be used on the booster seat tray. Great concept, but needs to be packed differently for shipping or the suction cups need to be moved so that they are not bent out of shape during shipping."
2,"Cannery Stuff, not much more","I purchased this DVD anxiously awaiting descriptions of earlyAlaskan fishing techniques. This is actually a feature on thehistory of early Alaskan Fishing Canneries. So, if you area cannery buff this DVD is for you. Dont, however, mistake thetitle for accounts of early Alaskan recreational fishing."
5,I Still Use It! 5 Years Later!,"I bought this book in '95 when it first came out and I needed to learn UNIX for my job. I was able to self-teach myself using the book and a shell account our sys adm guy set up for me. My only background before this was DOS.Today I still refer to the book even now and I recommend it to anyone trying to get a handle on files, script files, vi and all those other funs parts of UNIX."
5,"""Irreverent"" and ""Unix"" in the same sentence??","Remember that goofball teacher you had in high school? The one who got his points across in the middle of corny jokes?This book is like that. The style is fun to read, and the humor is unforced. I picked up quite a few tricks about shells and Unix. I bought an EMACS book 5 years ago; it's still unread, because it's so dry. I consumed this book in 4-5 sittings because I was entertained.The hilarious title and front cover alone make this a good conversation piece for your cubicle."
1,Underground Guide to UNIX,"This book sucks! The jokes & crap in it are very distracting, we want the facts not the fluff. Everyone in my class hates it*"
1,Horrible ice crashing,"I have a previous model (bought last year), and this model. This model (BL12475G ) is horrible for crashing ice. It has plenty of power, yet it cannot crash the ice. I have big chunks left after blending for a couple of minutes. The previous model was much nicer. The only reason I am keeping this one is because of how very cheap it was [...]."
1,Avoid this blender,"This blender lasted just a few months before the motor burned up. On average, we used it less than once a week for crushed ice or smoothies. Our previous blender (and food proceessor combo) from another company had lasted over 20 years with the same type of use."
1,Blender Broke and Warranty was not honored,Gears on blade disinigrated and blender no longer functions. Company wanted to charge 31.25 for part (replacement blade)...I think I paid 29.95 for blender.Ridiculous...will not buy a Black and Decker product again.
1,Blade Assembley Breaks Easily,The gear in the blade assembley is made out of plastic and broke within the first year that I bought it. The warranty was not honored and the replacement costs $26.
2,"Worked Ok, but not working any more",I was using it fine until yesterday and stopped working suddenly. The life seems too short. I am not if I can repair this.
1,Does not last,Bought two and they both broke down after light use. Moter burned out on one and cheap plastic coupling that turns the blades broke on the other. Do not buy this product.
4,Pretty But Messy.,"It is a really pretty color,and it works amazing,Just be careful not to open it too quickly,i did and most of the shadow fell out."
2,Great Novel - but CONDENSED,"I have read the Power of One, the unedited version and it is brilliant, inspiring, and brutal - one of the best books I've read. However, this edition that is being sold here, is the Young Reader's edition, which isn't immediately obvious from Amazon's description or the picture. It does say so on the cover, but it's very small unless you enlarge the picture. So, my review gives it a 2 as it may be an unpleasant surprise for those who want to read the actual novel."
2,Methodist minister from Georgia,"This man was my father's younger brother, but I never knew about him or even heard about him while growing up. I found this book when going through Dad's books and letters after he died in 1994. I found out that Robert recently passed away in 2008. I am sorry I didn't get a chance to speak with him and find out what disagreement could have been serious enough to make him cut off all lines of communication with his older brother. It may have been mutual. I have since learned more, but this is not a place to display family skeletons.The book fairly closely follows the Apostle's Creed in a series of sermons. The final chapter on forgiveness bears closer scrutiny."
4,"Nice watch, but the alarm could be a bit louder","This is a very nice looking watch with a very easy to set alarm. If the alarm was a bit louder I would have given it 5 stars.If you're tired of digital alarm watches, or digital watches in general, this is a great watch with a sporty look that can be worn on any occasion."
2,Not what i expected.,The directions did not come on paper with this product. They are written in silver on back of watch and were impossible to read. We had to purchase a magnifying glass to read it. The alarm is not loud enough and tends to go off at times other than is set. The watch has also stopped a couple of times. It has been a disappointing purchase.
1,Very disappointing,"This was a highly disappointing DVD. The Three Gorges Dam is the greatest manmade project of the modern age. I was expecting the DVD to focus on the engineering and construction of this wonder. Instead, the primary focus was on its - real and imagined - social and environmental impact. Many of the people interviewed betrayed a strong anti-dam bias, conjuring up all manner of speculative ""what if"" doomsday scenarios of the dam's impact. In one particularly jingoistic commentary, a man with a decidedly American accent intones gravely about what the Chinese people must be feeling about their dam. What?"
3,a mixed bag,"my kids begged for a logging truck after watching the ""House Construction Ahead"" video that includes footage of cool logging machines. Our Brio garbage truck has been so durable (they RIDE the thing, for heavens sake) that I figured this would be bomber as well. However, the pick-up claw broke after 10 minutes (on christmas morning, ouch). The company cheerfully replaced the broken piece, but that also broke after a couple days. The claw was never easy for little hands to manipulate - sized more for a grown-up and causing much toddler frustration - so I never bothered replacing it again. But the rest of the truck keeps going and going. My kids are now nearly 40 pounds and they have ridden it with their full weight daily for nearly a year now. I think its indestructible. What a shame that they put such a junky claw piece on an otherwise sturdy toy"
2,frustration,"My son has and loves the recycling truck that goes with this so we assumed this would be terrific however, the plastic logs slide out of the clamp and won't stay on the truck. He was so frustrated that I tried and couldn't get it to work either. He told me to send it back. We paid some ridiculous shipping charge so I didn't want to send it back if he could use it so my husband cut real wood logs for him to use and put tacking tape on the truck bed. He uses it often now and likes it a lot more."
4,Great watch with short lived Indiglo night-light,"The watch looks great and is very durable. The night-light is great while it lasts. The light on my last watch lasted about five months. I've had several of these watches over the last several years and everyone had problems with the night-light going out. The first time it happened, I had the battery replaced. I found that the light still didn't work with the new battery. If the battery is replacing, it is best to get someone with the special press tool to reinstall the back of the watch. With the night-light not working, the watch still looks and works great. The only problem is that you can't read the time without an external light."
4,Nice watch Looks good.,"Bought this watch here on Amazon, on sale, my husband loved it.The band runs large we had to remove a couple of links...but this means it will fit even larger men. I got for him as a replacement work watch, but now he wears his ""good"" watch to work, and kept this for home... Highly recommend when priced under 50.00"
4,handy dandy storage units,I am very happy with my product and it's reasonably fast delivery. The underbed storage drawers are exactly what I wanted.
2,See below,"The storage drawers are exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, two of the three were damaged. I used superglue to fix them. The packaging was not damaged. Just the contents."
5,Great boxes,I got these boxes to store photographic artwork in and they are just the size that I was searching for.
3,Still available and a valuable resource for the pioneer....,"This is a great little book. Not only is it useful for its stated purpose (making jelly), it is great for identifying and quantifying wild plants from which syrups and wines can be made.Kathryn March amply asserts that jelly can be made from almost anything growing wild that isn't toxic. This agrees quite well with my long standing assertion that if its not toxic and will support fermentation, you can probably make wine out of it. Thus, I like this book a lot. And, it uses tried and tested techniques for making jelly without using pectin, although one certainly can in many instances.While not exactly a field guide for identifying edible wild plants, the book can be used alone or in conjunction with a field identification guide. Although it is not a new release, it is still available and still a valid and valuable resource. For the naturalist or pioneer spirited, this is a unique and worthy addition to one's library."
2,Not as advertized,"This book was advertized as ""Like New"". I have purchased numerous books online and they were actually ""Like New""; however, this book had a torn cover, was scuffed up front and back, and had markings on it. I was disappointed."
5,Best in its class,"Again, another awesome purchase we have made from Tenba. We LOVE their backpacks. We have tried Lowerpro and various other manufacturers but seem to always come back to the Tenba bags. They are simply made the best. I have the Tenba Shootout medium for myself. I am 6'2 and it fits me perfectly. I bought the Shootout small for my wife who is petite at 5'2 and it fits her perfectly. She first ordered the mini but it was a little too small and didn't come with the back support belt. That is very important when carrying heavy photo gear while hiking. We have been traveling the western U.S. doing nature photography and have hiked MANY places with our Tenba bags. We have used them hard and they are both still holding up perfectly."
2,"Not as good as the ""original"" original!","I qualify this all by saying that I really DO enjoy Bette Midler and that I loved the album version of this song. The remixes, though, pale by comparison to Bette's tongue and cheek original. Of course even the album original can't match the true genius of its songwriter, Kirsty MacColl. If you want to experience the true emotion and sense of humor behind this song, check out Kirsty's ""Tropical Brainstorm"" album. Back to the remix, the third track is the most fun with kind of a retro-disco feel. All of the other hardcore dance stuff is worthless in my book."
5,"New Sound, Dance Mixes For Bette!!!!!",I really do like this CD single. It is fresh and new dance mix sound for the Divine Ms. M. It's really nice to have some of her songs turn into a dance track. Here are the tracking list if you would like to know before you buy this CD single. They are 7 dance track's on it. I hope you all like it as much as I do! :-)1) Radio Mix 4:102) Sound Factory Vox Mix 9:073) Mark's Heels To Platforms Vocal Mix 8:354) Other Side Mix 7:575) Extended Radio Mix 7:176) Sound Factory Dub Mix 8:507) Mark's Sole Dub 8:23
1,Brilliant performances. Fatal flaw.,"Why, oh why didn't they have a music consultant in the editing room! The video and sound are hopelessly out of sync, which renders this totally unwatchable. Unless ... if you happen to have a fairly laggy HDTV and a surround sound receiver that allows you to create a time offset, you can get it fairly locked in. So, for the whole first tune I just had to look away. Then I realized it's all off by the same amount, at which point I knew there was hope. So with a difference of 105ms between when I see the video and when I hear the sound (sound before video), it got pretty good. If I could have gone further I would have, but my TV lags 105ms.Dave Weckl absolutely kills at 1hr10mins! And everyone else is great as well. If you make the adjustment described above, this is well worth a viewing. Otherwise, it's still worth a listen."
4,Awesome,"Great performance, great selection of tunes, and great audio/video. A couple of shots were out of synch, but overall really great. Weckl plays like a freak of nature."
2,VERY LIGHT ON STEEL DRUMS,"This CD should be titled Tropical Music with other percussion. The music is good, but not what I expected by the title. Guitar is what you get mostly (80-85%) and when the steel drums finally come it is overshadowed by guitar. As far as Caribbean I would say not so much, more Hawaiian. As a tropical CD you will not be disappointed, but if you are looking for steel drums it isn't here, not one song is exclusively steel drums."
1,Disappointment,"The first disappointment for this book was the simplistic diaglogue. It is written, roughly, on a 7th grade grammer levelIt is a sweet story, but shallow. Then I picked up Anna, Grandmother of Jesus by Heartsong. There is no comparison for depth and content. There are several appendix & resource information in this second book. If you want more than a sweet story read the other book."
3,EARLY LIVE EXPLOITED !!!!!,"MAN,IT DOES'NT GET ANY PUNKIER THAN THIS,THIS IS THE SH..T !BUT THE SOUND,UNFORTUNATELY,IS HOPELESS."
5,"Engaging , Profound and Accessible","Education, in our modern world, separates the reductive clarity and practicality of mathematics from the ambiguous hues and the flights of imagination of literature at a fairly early stage. You dedicate yourself to one or the other. Berlinski, in this wonderful book, affirms that the distinction is arbitrary and contrived. That the symbols of language and equation can reinforce each other. That they can provide a synthesis of philosophy, science and poetry. Literally and figuratively, Berlinski succeeds in grand fashion. This is a book not to missed, regardless of which path you have chosen."
4,Very good,"I have some context to share an opinion on this book with since I have a BS in physics and I'm working on a MS in EE. I liked the book a great deal. Berlinski's PhD was in philosophy, and it shows, but he also knows a lot of mathematics. At one point he goes on about the richness of the concept of ""area."" And he talks for several pages about the idea and meaning of an irrational number. He says things that you will never read in a textbook. We all understand things in very human ways, like it or not, and some simple concepts such as area or what a number is, are not so simple and boring if you aren't proud or dismissive. I like Berlinski because he doesn't wave his hands over things and say they're easy, he discusses them.I highly recommend the book if you want a subjective, human-like discussion of calculus and some related basic mathematical concepts."
1,Lousy book on a great subject,"I can see why most of the reviews of this book in Amazon are either very good or very bad. This is one of those books that you either love or hate - I hated it. The book has a very noble aim - to explain the basics of calculus in easy non-mathematical language to the layman. Throw in history of the theorems and mathematicians as well, and you should have a winning combination in theory. What killed this book for me is the writing style. I abhorred the way in which this book was written. Berlinksi rambles on and on about anything and everything. I don't know why he has to constantly refer to calculus as ""the calculus"". In summary, this book did not go too well with me."
1,A tornado of projectile words,"I am a graduate of a top college, I teach calculus, and all I can say say is...what point is Berlinski trying to make with any of this? And why does he feel a need to use obscure words...to show off his vocabulary? He calls Descartes ""valetudinarian"", when he could have just said ""sickly"". With regard to mathematics, he makes errors and fails to clarify ideas. With regard to language, he creates ridiculous (and inappropriate) metaphors. What a windbag. What a waste of my time. And what a waste of time for anyone trying to learn calculus."
3,Overblown Writing Obscures Admirable Exposition,"There's a truly great 150 page book buried in the 300+ pages of this one. Berlinski strikes me as someone too in love with his own writing, and too concerned that his readers will find his ostensible subject difficult or uninteresting, to stick to the beautiful concepts of the calculus and the fascinating story of its development. After the first 100 pages, I found myself skipping entire paragraphs in which he says nothing in order to get to the ""good bits"". I did learn things from this book, and I think that any reader would, but in the end I wished I had spent the time on something else: a biography of Newton, perhaps, or a more rigorous calculus text."
1,Simply Annoying,This book is painful to read. I tried but could not come close to finishing this book. Berlinski is way to wordy for his own good. Please don't waste your money and time on such a sad excuse for a book.
2,BORRRING!,Boring. I was not at all interested in the ramblings of the author about his summer vacations to europe. There is the promise of an interesting book unfulfilled here. I hope Berlinski will write another.
3,A Nice Try,"I'd like to give this book a better score. I appreciate the author's attempt to make the calculus accessible to the casual reader but, unfortunately, he only partically succeeded. While he does use non-mathematic language to explain difficult concepts, he gets way too carried away with endless digressions."
2,A Mixed Bag,"I can definitely see the split of high and low reviews given this book. I thought the book was pretty good at giving an explanation of calculus concept and key theorems (especially on the differential calculus side). I particularly liked his explanation of the construction of the reals from the rationals by cuts in the number line. I recently reviewed a formal exposition of this that left me brain dead for several hours. On the other hand, Berlinski's cutesy anecdotes are horrid in the extreme. His use of the term ""the calculus"" instead of just ""calculus"" was also both pretentious and obnoxious. The writing style is not to my taste."
1,Star NOT,"I have taught calculus for the past 20 years and I consider it one of the ( if not the) greatest achievements and the most beautiful constructs(or findings?) of the human mind.In the hands of MR.Berlinski it turns into a gargoyle,even worse it turns into a heap of shapless being (if any). I rated the book with one star because I had no other option. My honest opinion is that it desreves a star NOT."
2,pretentious drivel obscures a beautiful topic,"This book has good potential - explain in a non-technical way the fundamental theorem of calculus, why it is important, and the history of it's development. The mathematicians who discovered and refined calculus are a fascinating lot, and the mathematics itself has proven to be perhaps the most effective engineering tool yet discovered. Sounds like good stuff. Unfortunately, Berlinski choose to shroud this simple theme in page after page of self-important, over-written, pretentious drivel. One of the reviews on the jacket puts this book in the same category as Godel, Escher, Bach - holy smokes! Nothing could be further from the truth. Buy GEB, stay away from this book!I give him 2 stars instead of one because the material underlying the terrible writing is interesting and worth knowing. Hopefully someone will write a readable book on this material!"
2,What a bore!,"This book is such a drag- not for the math bit, but the non-mathematical sections. The stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary, and detract from the substance. The problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math, and quite impossible to skip if you don't want to miss the math bit. To the extent I was able to drag on, the calculus portions seemed great, but it became too tiresome going through the flab.The great book on calculus has to be ""How to enjoy Calculus"" by Eli S. Pine- a book I regret not having known in my school days."
1,Very Disappointed!,"This is one of those rare books that I actually returned and asked for a refund. I know Calculus quite well, having studied it in college. Unfortunately, the presentation in textbooks is usually quite dry. I had hoped this popular book would bring out the beauty and elegance of the subject, making it come alive. It did not. The writing is dull and verbose, and the explanations are confusing. I feel sorry for anyone whose introduction to Calculus comes from this book. Save your money!"
4,the basics,"first of all, let me say that David Berlinski is a great writer. That being said, his book lacks a few things. If before you read this book you say ""calculus? what?"" this books is perfect, it will introduce you to the concept with startling ease. after you have read this book if you wish to learn more about calculus you may want to consider a more rigorous book. this book provides many examples but few or no test-practice problems. this is not a book to learn calculus from, it is merely an introduction."
2,Guilding the Lily,"Way too much metaphor. The overly florid linguistic style completely obscures the supposed object of the text...namely Calculus. Or said another way, it is REALLY hard to winnow out the extremely convoluted forays into an infinity of non-related domains to figure out what in the hell is Calculus anyway. Or, said another way, the author tries to hard to be clever and in so doing travels from New York to New Jersey in an eastward direction...to use a metaphor. I tried to get through it I really did. I have tried three times, but failed."
4,Beautiful inflight to the real math,"Mr. Berlinski book has made me see, through a powerful pedagogical lens, that most mathematics books, Calculus in particular, are a distilled and purified product of a brew made from the blood, sweat and tears of many mathematicians across the centuries. The next time I pick up a textbook and read ""it easily follows"" or "" it is clearly evident"", I'll know for sure that those words are, at least, presumptuous."
5,I finally understand calculus,"I have been exposed to calculus through a few college level courses, but I never understood calculus until reading this book. I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone struggling to understand the subject. If you consider yourself a non-math person who wants to understand calculus, this book is for you. If you consider yourself to be a verbal person, this book is really for you.I'll finalize this review with one of my favorite quotes from the book: ""I will open the dark shade to let a single shaft of sunlight shine through; but let me say this, please, that things are easier than they look and that only the thickness of the finest India paper separates you - yes, you - from understanding everything.""Thanks to David Berlinski for helping me to understand.Oh, btw, apparently the author is a crazy ""Intelligent Design"" dude, but none of that [...] appears in this book."
1,Zero stars,"This is one of the worst books that I ever thrown away. I like recreational math, but this book is not about math. This book is about David Berlinski's masturbatory writing and his European vacation. He loses the reader and his own train of thought in his flowery run-on sentences.He is a horrible teacher and cannot express simple ideas clearly. Albert Einstein said, ""if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" Apparently, David Berlinski understand neither calculus or writing well enough. If you are reading this, Mr. Berlinski, I recommend Strunk and White's ""The Elements of Style."" Please."
2,I Hate It.,"I hate this book. I bought it because its writing looked informal and intimate, but I soon realized that the writing style is pompous and cryptic, the writer turning what I had dearly hoped might be the one easily-accessible and enjoyable book on calculus, into a hellish morass of insider references and pretentious SAT snob words. If you've ever heard Dennis Miller's stand-up ""comedy"", with all his exclusionary insider references, you have a very good idea of what this ""Diane Chambers"" of a book is all about. My advice? If you're looking for an easily-accessible book on calculus, I'm afraid you're just going to have to keep waiting."
3,The Differential Dandy,"Mr. Berlinski's ""Magical Mystery Tour"", is aperipatetic paean to the power and grandeur ofMathematica's noblesse oblige: The Calculus!This rambunctious, erudite presentation embracesstyle over instructional content. However, Mr.Berlinski never fails to inform nor entertain. Heis genuinely intoxicated by the monumental implications and formal intellectual dexterity, this ""Fantastic Idea"" has conceptually wrought.In the words of the author, ""the historicaldevelopment of the calculus signifies an exercisein delayed gratification."" Fortuitously, a termwe would not deploy in characterization of Mr.Berlinski's ambitious achievement."
2,worthless rant. Editor should have cut the non-math stuff.,"I read this book by jumping over the author's meandering way off topic which is just a worthless rant, Maybe he things he is Proust? Toss this guy over the side. If your are looking for a literary look at mathematics that will walk you through the ideas and proofs therein (including calculus, continuity, and limits) I recommend instead that you are David Foster Wallaces ""A History of Infinity"" (Here is a review I wrote of that [...])"
1,Don't waste your money.,"David Berlinski's writing in this book is so terrible that I couldn't bear to read past the first chapter; and I love math! Read Trent Austin's review from September 8, 2002 for a detailed, accurate critique of this book."
4,Only one glaring error,"An excellent work. Yes, it is wordy, but ... so what? The only glaring error that I found was his confusing ""speed"" with ""velocity"". Speed is a scalar, velocity a vector quantity. The first derivative of displacement is speed, not velocity. Shame on him!"
1,not even bad,"Read all of the bad reviews, then read this book just to see that it is impossible to describe in mere words how truly terrible this author's writing style is. This book is truly deserving of zero stars, assuming negative stars or anti-stars are unavailable."
1,Offensive,"As I recline gently in my reproduction eighteenth-century leather-backed desk chair, my hulking athletic frame weary from the day's toils, I breathe a sigh, and casually reflect upon my Berlinski reading experience. Each evening for the previous fortnight I had curled up in front of the warm, flickering fire, book in hand, brandy at side, and marveled at how many adjectives could be strung together merely through the prolific use of commas. Oh calculus, noblest of mathematical fields, will my weary intellect ever fully comprehend your vast depths and many intricacies? As I remorselessly toss this volume onto the hungry flames I feel a flood of relief overcome my body, heightening my spirits with the knowledge that I would not have to read this drivel again.If you enjoyed plodding through this wordy (and poorly written) review just to find out that I thought this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, then by all means buy this book. It's for you."
1,"I tried twice to finish it, I really did...","This time I picked it up thinking I could finish it because I'm teaching calculus this term. I knew the prose was absurdly flowery, to the point of severe distraction, but I thought I could get some nice images and phrases for my students. But I can't read any more. It's like listening to a Dan Fogelberg song. The points Berlinksi wants to make are terribly contorted in order to fit around his intended imagery. I must look elsewhere. Berlinki cannot help since he's just too full of himself here. I will not give this book to the library. I'll throw it in a Goodwill bin and hope they only charge a quarter for it. It is worth that. I'd throw it in the trash but I can't do that to any book."
2,"Interesting concepts, but puzzling English.","What I hoped I'd get from this book is a simple introduction to the concepts of Calculus. I've taken Calculus before, but I wanted to really understand it.I felt like the author used too many obscure metaphors. The English was unnecessarily advanced.It didn't hold my interest."
1,Skip this book,I agree with the other reviewers who gave this 1 or 2 stars. This is a tedious book that doesn't help someone enjoy the beauty of math. Why the author takes pages and pages creeping up on the description of the number line is incomprehensible. This book was so disappointing and needlessly wordy that I couldn't finish it. Buy something else.
2,A good book to make you sleep,"I don't know how many times I fell a sleep while reading this book. The excessively verbose descriptions go on and on and on... I do not recommend it to anyone who wants to read an enlightening math book.The book also contains an egregious and intolerable mathematical error. He leaves out the important ""dx"" in every integration. As the derivative of F, ""dF/dx"" means the ratio of the differential of F (dF) to the differential of x (dx). Integration has to contain the ""dx"" so that the anti-differentiation is applied to dF rather than to the derivative."
2,Hard to Read,"I'm having problems getting past the first 30 pages because of the author's writing style. David Berlinski must have the world's most worn copy of Roget's Thesaurus. Like most engineering and/or math majors, I don't think I had enough English to understand half of what he's trying to say. By the time I trudge through this book, I'll have the most worn copy of Roget's."
1,Not Recommended,"Wordy, prose filled, book with little math. There are many heavy hitters in this field. I liked ""Calculus Made Easy"", by Silvanus P. Thompson and ""What is Calculus About?"", by W.W. Sawyer much better."
2,The math is smothered by words,"I tried twice to finish this book without success. The writing is overblown and self-indulgent. The mathematical ideas are drowned by excessive verbiage. Though Berlinski promises somewhere in mid-book reduce the bs, he immediately and ever reneges. Much better is ""The Mathematical universe"" by Dunham."
1,An indistinct mix of personal equations and proven theorems.,"Worst of all, when an author seeks to explain difficult issues by clouding them with personal, unproved arguments that only cause further confusion. I did not benefit."
3,Funny. Enjoyed it. A nice overview.,There are quite a few reviewers that consider Mr. Berlinski too wordy. He is and he admits it. It only occasionally distracted me. Most of the time I found myself laughing during his diversions. He did a nice job of touching on the historical figures involved. The discussion of the fusing of the line and real number system was particularly thought provoking. I recommend this book.
1,the cap breaks off because it gets sticky with honey,"The bottle is pretty but not very functional. The honey on the glass bottle makes it sticky and the cap gets stuck. After a couple uses, when i twisted it off, the cap got completely stuck. Customer service was not helpful at all as they said it never happened for them - (not listening to their customers!) I wouldn't recommend this honey in the flute - if they had better packaging the honey is great!"
1,Italians can't rap,"NEFFA proves that Italians do not understand the true essence of hip-hop. The group is nothing more than a pathetic refugee camp of wack unemployed greasy Italian MC's and a couple of American stragglers who couldn't find work back in the States. As far as their so-called beats are concerned, they lack flava and spirit. These punks make Vanilla Ice look like Rakim. These toys can't even get no respect in their own home country. Florence, Venice, and Rome have no love for NEFFA. If you want the really dope s***, then go to Amsterdam, where it's always all good. Check out MC Spliff, Sir Smokes-A-Lot, or the Bong Squad (aka the Hash Pipe All-Stars). Peace Out and Word to the Gods."
1,Rip Off!,"This is the prime example of why I never, nor will ever buy unofficial merchandise, not only about Robert, or any actor/actress. These companies are just cashing in on Rob's hard work. If you really want to support Rob, this is not the way to do it. Another reason is, that they are now blatantly copying word for word posts on dedicated Rob fan blogs, that take their own personal time and effort in helping to support Rob and his career. Save your money, invest it in a ticket to see New Moon, and keep respecting Rob's work."
1,DVD is a RIPOFF,Please do not buy this DVD. The company is outright copying material from devoted Robert Pattinson bloggers and claiming as their own.
1,THIEVES,You're stealing content from RobsessedPattinson! You messed with the wrong fanbase. There's MILLIONS of us and we're VERY organized. Word of this crap is going to spread like wildfire. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!! Rob makes no money from it. It's UNAUTHORIZED. They're just cashing in on his fame.
1,TOTAL RIP OFF CREATED BY THEIVES!!!,"Do NOT purchase this piece of crap dvd, this is a blatant extortion of Robert Pattinson and simply a way to make a ton of cash off his back. the people who created this dvd have also created a blog and are totally copying the fansite blog of the same name, as well as at least one other blog and claiming that these blogs are writing for them-this is a TOTAL LIE!! stay away from these people and their products, they are complete theives who need to be stopped in their tracks!! If you are a true fan of Rob's, please DO NOT be manipulated by these people."
1,"Stay far away, Don't buy this...","First let me say I gave this awful dvd 1 star because it would not let me post this without checking off something, so that is in no way any type of endorsment for this awful dvd. This is another sad attempt at making money off of someone else's life. We hound this poor guy enough and he can't even take a smoke break without us wanting to know everything he is doing. This is not original material and has been stolen from other sources, it also is not beneficial to Rob at all. He deserves to at least make money on something that is causing utter chaos on his life. Obession for Rob is not bad, just do it in the healthy safe way for Rob himself. Don't buy into the crap, stick to the real info and legitimate products!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not purchase this DVD - Not only are they trying to cash in on Rob Pattinson's popularity, this company has stolen content from fan blogs and is currently trying to pass it off as their own!Do not support theft!!"
1,Not Worth a Penny,It's very sad that this company would stoop so low as to use unauthorized material that belongs to other people and claim it as their own. I refuse to pay a penny for this item because I don't believe that the company releasing this DVD deserves even that much. Shame on you for taking information from online blogs who worked very hard to obtain their information and present it FREE on their sites in a responsible and respectable manner. I hope that others will think twice before even thinking about purchasing this item!
1,not cool...,"I am saddened on many fronts with this product. The first being that Revolver Entertainment would produce an unauthorized bio just to cash in on Mr. Pattinson's sudden fame. Secondly, they did so by taking content from fansites without permission. It is unethical and unprofessional. Please do not support these acts by purchasing this item."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!This is a total rip-off. Shameless profiting by ripping-off a blog site. Complete disregard for Robert Pattinson by using his name to sell their dvd his fans. Rob is unaware of this. He is not profting from this venture. His management has not authorized this. It's up to us to help other unsuspecting fans from buying this. We need to get this product off the shelves. I'm aware this is a small step but it's better than not doing anything to stop this atrocity.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"
1,Real fangirls don't buy this DVD,"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY, DON'T BUY THIS DVD. IT'S BEEN PLAGARIZED WORD FOR WORD OFF OF EVERY SINGLE ROB-RELATED FANSITE THAT IS AUTHORIZED. PLEASE, IF YOU LOVE ROB, DON'T BUY THS DVD. IT'S UNAUTHORIZED, IT BENEFITS NO ONE, AND THE COMPANY MAKING THIS CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ORIGINAL AND INSTEAD RIPOFFS ON THE REAL SITES."
1,Disappointing,"Got this as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. A few great photos splashed between TONS of looooonng, dry, dull interviews. Ugh."
1,What a joke,"I'm with everyone else on this. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! There was not one scene where Rob spoke, very disappointing. You can obtain all of the information in this video online for free."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD,Whoever came up with the idea to copy and use another's ideas to make money off of should be ashamed of themselves. Blatant plagarism. Go get his interviews and photos off the net legally and for free!
1,DO NOT BUY!,Please do not buy this video- there are many reasons...the most important is that there is nothing original about it. They have only copied their content from Rob fan-sites and blogs! It is really a shame that this seems to be a trend in the entertainment business...pirating others creativity and coming up with nothing new on their own. Don't support this kind of business and don't support this blatant exploitation of Rob...if you are truly a Rob Pattinson fan!
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY this DVD. This is a blatant rip off of Rob, using his popularity to make money with no benefit to him. In addition they stole other peoples blog posts word for word, and picture for picture, with NO PERMISSION. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Good stuff,Interesting DVD about an interesting new star. I don't understand all the flaming. What is all that about? I'd ignore it.
1,Not worth your money,"Seeing this is an unauthorized biography - much of the information is stuff we already know or information you could obtain for free off many of Rob's wonderful fan sites that already exist on the internet! Having been a teen during Leo-Mania when Titanic was the rage and having bought unauthorized dvd's like these, if I knew then what I know now about the money that goes into these things for company gain without any profit for the actor - I say fail. Do not buy this dvd."
1,"Blatant Ripoff for Rob fans, AVOID like a plague","I wouldn't buy this DVD, I have read enough about it to know I would prefer sticking to search for Rob interviews on youtube and they are FREE, and visit GREAT Rob fansites to get all the info I want about Rob and rare interviews too. Why would I let a company cash in on his fame? If this was an officially released DVD approved by Rob and his representatives I'd happily get it.Also another thing, there is a website out there, a blog, to promote this, and no I will NOT link to it here..but they are STEALING content from well known Rob blogs, word by word, picture by picture, even videos. Not sure if the company behind the DVD knows about this but if they do and allow this, it is a shady way of promoting your products. AVOID AT ALL COSTS I would say."
1,Not Worth It,Mostly re-hashed old photos and interviews with people you've never heard of from Pattinson's early amateur theatre days. No new first-hand interviews or footage.
1,RIP OFF ALERT,You guys are a rip off and KNOW that you are stealing almost word for word from ROBsessed-addicted to Robert Pattinson.Shame on you and I hope you make $0.
1,Do NOT buy this DVD,Do not buy this DVD. This company is stealing content from fan blogs and claiming that these fan blogs work for them. They are ripping off fans of Robert Pattinson. Do NOT support theft!
1,BOYCOTT THIS ITEM!!!,"This item is not authorized by Robert Pattinson or his representatives. There have been some alleged shady dealings with a well-respected blog site which, if true, is extremely offensive. If you truly want to support Rob, preorder the movies for which he actually gets royalties for and poured his heart and soul into: The Haunted Airman, How To Be, and Little Ashes. Please don't perpetuate the paparazzi/media problem by purchasing this item!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,This is a total rip off and exploits a talented actor who is not associated with this DVD and it negatively reflects on a fan website that uses the same name. DO NOT BUY PLEASE!!!! The rating forced to enter a minimum of 1 star otherwise I would have given it zero stars.
1,Don't buy this POS,trying to make a profit off regurgitated info from fan sites is pathetic. you've lost your audience. good luck
3,MLK Bogus!,"I wish people really knew more about this book. They would realize Martin Luther King had an agenda to split the United States up, to help the Hollywood Communists continue their dividing the American public with smoke and mirrors. Jesse Jackson is one of their current greedy freinds."
5,Extremely Funny.,"This book was hilarious. I found it at a Barnes and Noble, it's basically a self-help guide for villains who've become depressed with their lives. It tells how to decorate your lair, make new friends and throw evil parties. Very funny stuff. The illustrations were also great, I just wish there could have been more material. The section on evil dating is probably my favorite."
5,The Villan's Guide to Better Living,The Villan's Guide to Better Living is a book for all you up and coming evil-doers. This book shows you how to do things like protect your lair and how to motivate your minions. It also covers the finer things in life like dating and how to make evil friends.My favorite part in this book is when they went over how to protect and care for your evil abode. They went over the old-fashioned style moat and spiked fence. They also covered more in-depth approaches like casting a spell over your house to make it invisible. They also showed you easy ways to care for a lair like how to fix up a dungeons and take care of a carnivorous garden.I would definitly recommend this book to any up and coming villan. This book has helped me in my own evil doing and it will help in yours. When I read this book it made me realize how much better my life could be. It showed me that there is a whole other side to life. Any up and coming evil villan should read this book.
5,extremely helpful.,"Okay, yes, so this is a criminally quick read, whatever. I can honestly say it reaffirmed standing opinions and offered some great advice."
1,Guide on how to be a looser not a villian,So I bought the book because of the catchy title. Opened the book to a page and read before purchasing. It was funny. So i decided to buy. Got home read the book in about 30 minutes and the only funny page was the one I read in the book store. Stay away from this title.I mean I think we can all figure out how to decorate our house like a wantabe vampire
3,Great Quality But What have I learned,"It is that mop haired dude that plays two guitars at once. Fun watching him play but the information is fairly hard to follow. frankly, I was bored in about 10 minutes trying to figure the crap out. I guess I wanted easier to look at tablature to go with it. I was on the screen instead of download it would have been better. And that dude can wail and I am huge fan of Dean Markely guitars being played with shredders- I have one myself. Trim your fingernails and get a metronome. Its worth a look just for the performances."
1,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this sweatshirt! I bought 3 as gifts and was embarrassed to give them. Sweatshirt quality is ok, but graphics are totally unacceptable.While the photo shows ""DUNCAN"" as being bright and irridescent with ending letters a shiny silver, the real thing is nothing like that. The letters are printed a drab, dull gray which fade out at the end of the word! In fact, the last 3 letters appear as if they ran out of ink and are ""irregulars"". And, since all three I ordered are the same, it's not a ""mistake"".Don't waste your money -- this sweatshirt is not worth it!"
3,All Hail the Melvins!!!!!!!!!!!,"Melvins - 26 Songs is a re-release of the 1986 freshmen release from the great not yet late MELVINS! Also included are 16 demos and unreleased tracks including a nice demo of ""set me straight"". Most of the demos are in fact demos of the aforemetioned ""10 songs"", but there are a few never before heard anthems of grind. A must have for those unable to find the elusive 10 songs original release, otherwise you would probably have to be a hardcore Melvins fan (like me) to enjoy this one. I still cant believe how long I have been listening to this band. Here's to longevity!"
2,egh....,"i love the melvins but i find their earliest records really uninteresting, sometimes almost boring. i gave this one a once over and have yet to feel the desire to return again. some of ozma is decent and bullhead on is when they really took off in my opinion."
5,Truly a miracle product!,"I've used Spray-N-Grow for over 20 years, and I consider it one of the true 'miracle products' on the market today. In fact, back in the 80's, I sent in photos of a streptocarpus I had grown using this product, which had over 100 luxuriant blooms! This photo was then printed in their next mailing.My understanding is that its micronutrients boost growth and enable the plant to more fully utilize what's in the soil. Flower count, particularly of annuals like impatiens, are astounding. Moreover, one can see the results almost immediately on 'tired' plants, which perk up within minutes. Spray-N-Grow sends out marketing material, as mentioned, that features photos sent in from happy growers, including vegetable growers. It's all true! I've never heard of anyone being disappointed in this product."
1,Watch out for impatiens if using this product,"In my neighborhood, I am the ""container garden queen"". I am currently (in June 2012) on my fourth week of using Spray n Grow. So far I have lost all the impatiens (22 or 23 plants). They simply yellowed out and then dropped off. The plants came from various nurseries, so I don't think it was the plants. The salvia is yellowing out now. Don't want to lose them so will stop using the product on them. The geraniums on the other hand LUV this stuff. I have never seen such great reactions on a geranium before. Due to the fact that no warnings are given for certain plants, I give this a one star and am still insecure to use it on anything except the geraniums. P.S. I am also seeing negative results on begonias, but not as bad as the impatiens. The impatiens I have in the ground are also crapping out."
2,dissapointed,"Have only used the product once. So far , no significant signs of change when used on houseplants. Will try it on outside plants when weather warms up."
3,Mediocre,"At first I was very happy with this watch. It is attractive, and just the right size for my extremely slender wrist. However, after about 2 months of use, the glowlight stopped working. After about 8 months of use, the band broke while I was out shopping and the watch fell off my wrist and I was unable to recover it. This is a nice looking watch but it is not especially good quality; it should come with band that can take frequent use for more than 8 months."
5,love this watch,"I have 4 of these, in case the battery dies or the strap breaks and I can't get it fixed right away, because I can't bear to be without one. Some are gold, some are silver, etc. Easy reader is awesome because it looks like a kitchen clock. For someone like me who can't see that well it's perfect. The indiglo light allows you to see the time in the dark, such as at a movie theater, which is great. I love the timex easy reader, it's practically the only watch I ever wear. I don't like the date feature on some of them, though, because it doesn't have the month so the date is going to be off anyway. Getting it through amazon is the best deal, can't beat it. I got 1 of mine on amazon, was very satisfied."
3,battery replacement,"My wife liked this watch very much. But now the battery has run down, and I can't get the back off to replace it. What a waste."
4,basic watch,"This Timex watch (for women) is a basic model with a traditional face, but it has an Indiglo backlight which is a nice feature. It's a bit smaller than I had anticipated (given that it's called the ""Easy Reader""). The user seems satisfied with the watch, but I would have gone with a slightly larger model had I been browsing the item in person."
5,Beautiful clean design.,"Almost everyone has owned a Timex watch at one time or another. They make great gifts for Birthdays, Graducations, Christmas...The reason for that popularity is that they are excellent, durable and beautiful products, universally well-received by young and old, alike. At this price, buy one for yourself now and get an extra -- be prepared for your next gift-giving occasion. You won't be sorry!"
2,Very Disapointed.,"I was very very happy when I recieved this watch, it looks amazing! Highly attractive! it truly does, very tiny and perfect for small wrists! However it all started when I could not get the date to change at the right times and the gears would hesitate or not move when I would try and change time and date. One morning the entire watch stopped working! I sent it in and customer service was amazing, recieved a new watch that was exactly the same, however condensation had started to build up on the inside. Sad seeing as now I have gone through two watches in less then three months! However once again customer service was amazing and quick to fix the problem. The watch itslef, I have had nothing but problems with but the people at Timex will try and fix the problem quickly."
3,the leather strap broke within 24 hours - was rotted through,"the watch is nice - but buy a new strap immediately. This one must have been sitting around on a shelf for a long time, the leather was rotted right through."
2,defective,I think this watch is defective. I couldn't get it to work after setting the time. I followed the directions and my husband looked at it and couldn't get it to work either. Too bad because it's a pretty watch.
5,A Scholarly Masterpiece,"George Yancy's philosophical eye is most acute at examining ""What White Looks Like."" This scholarly gem critiques, theorizes, and centers the burgeoning field of whiteness studies from the perspective of African-American philosophers. Assembled in this text are a cadre of erudite philosophers like Charles W. Mills and Robert E. Birt who break new philosophical ground while they consider and question ""accepted"" theories on race espoused by patricians such as Foucault, Hegel, and Kant. This unique examination of whiteness by these scholars offers fresh insights that are useful to both the scholar and the student. I highly recommend this work as a must read for all who are interested in this most fascinating field."
3,Price is no object?,"This is the least expensive external drive storage anywhere. The colors are bright and heat is dissipated quickly even during intensive hour long data transfers.Swapping drives out of this case is problematic, tolerances are small and fasteners are smaller. Drive connections are easy. Everything is included plus a screwdriver.Do yourself a favor and don't rely on just one for two drives."
3,Meh,"I listened to the samples online and it sounded intriguing. But the actual album is kind of bland. It has none of the pop of the Beatles themselves. Good generic classical music, though."
4,"Beautiful watch, great price, but not as advertised","This watch is beautiful and very easy to read (love the Indiglo feature), however it is not as advertised. The watch will time a maximum of 30 minutes, not 12 hours, as the small dial at the 2 o'clock position measures 1/20th of a second (I checked this with Timex). The dial at the 10 o'clock position measures a maximum of 30 minutes, and the dial at the 6 o'clock position is constantly running seconds.Bottom line: If you want a great looking watch that's easy to read, with a 30 minute chronograph, this one is hard to beat. If you need a chronograph that will record ""over"" 30 minutes, without writing the start time down, this one won't do the job.The only reason I gave it four stars is the fact that it's not as advertised."
4,Easy to read and understand.,"The price of this book is very reasonable considering all of the information one can learn about Las Vegas. However, I felt as though it could have included more information such as a list of houses of worship and public transportation for those who don't feel comfortable driving around in strange cities. It really is a book for those who plan on renting a car and seeing the city by car. Nonetheless, I think everyone who plans to visit Las Vegas should read this book as it is well-written and the layout is great. It's a fun book to read and it's well worth the price. If I ever get out to Las Vegas, I will absolutely take this book with me as it has a lot of information about hotels and restaurants. It's definitely not stuffy or boring. Even young people would find it easy reading compared to some of the more lengthy, wordy travel guides."
1,Old information,"If this book is a 2010 edition, then these reviews are very old. Where are the new reviews? Does anyone proof the reviews or am I actually looking at a book that's 10 years old?"
2,"The CD hasn't gripped me, I doubt it ever will","First the good news. This 29-track double-disc is better than 'Up Up Up' and 'To the Teeth' combined. The bad news - this means that I only like about 8 of the 29 songs here. Ani's funk attempts haven't improved much, the low-key acoustic songs get the sound right but often drag noticeably. A lot of fans have advised people to ""give it a chance."" I would agree with that if I thought that time and attention would pay off. But I just don't play this CD much. I never had to be 'forced' to play the 'Puddle Dive' and 'Out of Range' CDs. Her earlier work COMPELLED my attention. 'Revelling/Reckoning' is so lengthy and hit-and-miss, the great tracks like ""Garden of Simple"" & ""Subdivision"" are hard to spot. (Though the song ""Grey"" is absolutely wonderful). If I buy Ani's CDs in the future, it will be more out of consumer habit than out of eagerness. If you buy this CD, feel no shame in actively using your CD programmer. You may find you need it."
5,krista marlena,"ani continues to amaze me as she virtually tells the tales of my life ( i know many feel the same). she poetically sums up our world with such beauty and empathy, she brings me to tears and leaves me saying, ""yes, exactlly."" ani speaks to the many aspects of our society overlooked by mtv and abc, and gives a voice to those who feel unheard or unable to explain. her music is lifeblood for the starving artists, solace for the silent magic workers of our generation. it takes a few nights of really listening,and a few drives around the city with the cd spinning, and suddenly you start to hear the tales completely. ani fans, new and dedicated need to add this one to your collection."
3,Ani's R&R is not rock and roll,"In an interview Paul McCartney said something like this about critics...They would be a lot easier to take if their review said something like..'the song stank and here's one I wrote that I think is better'. I don't write songs but here's my 2 cents worth. I've heard this CD called ""mature"" and ""sophisticated"". I think it's jazzy. As in free form jazz.Disharmonic in places,well done, and it works if you like that. It's night-clubish. It's a lot low key. Can Ani be sedate? She is definetly reflective as the title indicates. No driving beats, no heavy base. You won't be bouncing in your chair. The girl can sing but she's not letting it rip in this this CD. This is not negative. Just trying to give you an idea of what to expect. Jim Somewhere over middle America"
2,I'm so disappointed :(,"I basically ran to the local NRM to purchase this new ani difranco cd. I stuck it in the my guy friends cd player and was shocked to find out that ani sucks, her lyrics still beautiful, but her music is almost fading away. something happened to that strong voice and stong guitar, its as if listing through a brick wall. I love ani but as many times as i listen to this album i just can't get how you can go from Not a Pretty Girl and Imperfectly to this... well im not going to say not to buy this, because it is good, but its not what i was expecting."
2,Is this even folk still?,"Ani changed the meaning of folk rock with her earlier albums. Here, she has changed the way people will classify her music. I enjoyed the folk-rock music of Ani's past. The music on this new album is very different and hard to compare to her past music. I really feel that it is not at the same level as her previous releases.I think that fans of Ani will buy the album, listen to it 100 times and find that they can at some point sing along. But it is not the fun/angry music which Ani had made people crave. This album is slow, quite and simply boring. I had hoped for something more.I respect Ani's artistic search for new things...but this is really the first of her albums that I felt no connection to. And owning all of her albums, it is sad when you feel you have lost that connection to the artist.I hope that if you buy it, you have a better experience with it."
1,Really Dull,"The problem with this album is EGO. The music is dull for the most part although there are a few complex pieces. Instead she relies on her lyrics.Why not just call it a spoken word album and get rid of the background music all together? Well because the words don't hold up much either. They are self indulgent, nihilistic, and with rare exception the poetry of a 16 yr old.Never the less, the 2 CD make for good background music while you are doing something else. And that's not a bad thing."
1,What?,I didn't care for even 1 song on this album. I am a bigAni fan and I just like her old acoustic poetic stuff.I don't know what this was? I will probably tryand unload this one. I will be cautious about buyinganything again before I listen to it first.
1,I want my money back!!,"I have been a dedicated fan for years, and this will be my last DiFranco purchase for a very long time. It is clear she did not spend much time or thought writing either of these CD's. The CD jacket is the best thing about this purchase. If you are looking for the old DiFranco who rocked with meaningful lyrics, this is not for you. This CD is a testament to how an artist can suck her fans dry by putting out a bad product, (the last three albums) and they will keep buying."
3,UNDECIDED,"I'm not so sure this one is going to grow on me like past Ani albums. Some of the songs could do without the constant barrage of horns. The horns in harmony tend to sour some really nice guitar rifs. The horns on ""To the teeth"" with Maceo were much cleaner and more produced. This album sounds like many songs were recorded in one take. Other than that, it's a decent addition to any collection. Some of her guitar work is incredible, much more jazzy. ""rock paper scissors""is great. So is ""grey"". A must for any hardcore fan but not a must for the novice fan."
4,Musical evolution,"I didn't know what to expect with Reckoning/Revelling, but Ani's latest is definitely growing on me. With each album, she continues to expand musically and emotionally. Feelings are very raw and exposed on this CD-set, as if she's giving her listeners a peek in her personal diary. For anyone who has not purchased R/R yet, here's a major tip: don't look for a continuation of To the Teeth, Little Plastic Castle, or even Dilate. This is an older, more mature Ani Difranco. Listen with an unbiased ear, and witness her musical evolution."
2,Hmm...,"Well.. being a major fan of stuff from 'Not a Pretty Girl'; Dilate; Living in Clip, LPC (my fave) the more alt/folkie stuff... I was VERY disappointed in this cd. I live in Buffalo and will ALWAYS love Ani. I'm not a huge fan of jazz... which is why I liked Ani so much before To The Teeth and this cd. Mind you.. there a couple good songs on the double cd, but I thought that alot of it sounded the same. As in the always flanged out guitar and the basic sound of the thing.Don't get me wrong.. I totally believe in people changing their sound. I have often gotten pissed off at the fans whos website were like: I hate Ani.. she changed.. (that annoys me to no end)But.. if you like jazzy stuff.. go buy the cd. If you prefer older works.. dont buy it. I just wish she would combine the two. I personally think the best song on the CD is Grey.But like I said.. for an Ani cd.. it sucks.. but for a jazz cd.. its ok.."
4,it took a bit of time to grow on me...one day :),"at first, i was a bit perplexed. i had been listening to little plastic castle so much, i felt like there wasn't as much happiness or even much of ani on this album. i thought revelling was a bit slow, and almost dreaded reckoning, thinking it would be snails pace. BUT, reckoning was beautiful...however, for me, it seems like a good choice for night music....it's not necessarily sleepy, but it's definitely quiet. now by the second day i was listening, i felt like i was hearing a totally different album. i guess i was finally hearing the songs for what the were...different from the past, something new. as a songwriter/composer, this woman is incredible. i think i'm still getting the old ani that i crave, plus much more growth from her and more depth musically in her arrangements. i likey! hope you likey too!"
3,Takes some getting use to,"Ani DiFranco typically creates the kind of album that you listen to once, love and sing every word of every song, and never know the title of a single track. That is a Typical DiFranco album. However, Reckoning/Revelling is not that typical DiFranco album. After listening to each track several times now, I found this double CD set not to be taht one free flowing Righteous Babe melody I have gron to love. Yeah the Reckoning tracks are completely different from the Revelling, but all together, its all over. I am not saying this is a positive or negative performance by Ani, just different. I pledge to continue listening, throw away the words scribed in that 'pretty' case, and somehow find where she is attempting to take me."
3,stop me wont you if you've heard this one before,"ani difranco's albums are the continuing sndtrk. to my life, i often refer to her songs as my bible.... i hope this new album grows on me,'cuz i'm not so sure about it yet. since her '96 release Dilate, ani's sound has been changing and evolving with each new album, on this one she sorta sounds like she's stuck in a rut, her voice sounds tired and her lyrics tend to be on the obscure side. there are some really great songs on this one, so i'll keep listening and hopefully i'll grow to love this one like all her others."
4,Just buy it... trust me,"Not Ani's best CD, but definitely not her worst. I saw her in concert in November and she performed a few songs from R/R (""Revelling,"" ""Tamburitza Lingua,"" ""Marrow,"" etc.) so I couldn't WAIT to buy this CD. I wasn't disappointed. Ani's musical style seems to have evolved a bit... slightly more folk, less rock. But it still kicks butt. ""Marrow,"" ""Tamburitza Lingua,"" and ""What How When Where (Why Who)"" are among my favorite songs on this smartly written album. As always, the lyrics are among the best parts of this album."
5,one of the best,"This is my first Ani Difranco record, i kinda just jumped on the bandwagon. I saw her in concert last night and she is so awesome!! One of the best concerts ive ever been to. there really is no one quite like her, and there will never be another like her. Revelling is more upbeat and has the full band. My favorite song off of this is ""Marrow"". its the 4th song she performed and is a beautiful and well crafted song. Reckoning is just her and her guitar, and the chemistry is indescribable (or is it UNdiscribable? i dont know) the best song on this one is the title track. This is the perfect album for the new ani fan as myself. since then i bought two of her other records, ""Little plastic Castle"" and ""To the teeth"". this one is the best of the three in my opinion. maybe the other ones have to grow on me. i dont care how you get this cd, just GET IT."
5,it's hard to keep up with time once it's on it's way,"ani continues to amaze me as she virtually tells the tales of my life ( i know many feel the same). she poetically sums up our world with such beauty and empathy, she brings me to tears and leaves me saying, ""yes, exactlly."" ani speaks to the many aspects of our society overlooked by mtv and abc, and gives a voice to those who feel unheard or unable to explain. her music is lifeblood for the starving artists, solace for the silent magic workers of our generation. it takes a few nights of really listening,and a few drives around the city with the cd spinning, and suddenly you start to hear the tales completely. ani fans, new and dedicated need to add this one to your collection."
4,"Little, Orange, Different...","Ani has once again blown me away with an exceptional mix of lyrics and rhythm. This CD is amazing, and while I am still partial to her earlier sound, this new, sort of loungy/jazzy mix really excentuates the range of her voice. I just wish there were more lyrics in some of the songs. It is always her words that really get me. But, as always, Ani stays true to her sound and to her beliefs. Buy this CD, it is great! :)"
3,Funk,I can summarize this album in one word: FUNK. This album drips with Funk. Funky as your grandpas drawers. I love Ani but I must say she is no Shahka Kahn. Maceo's sax is saxy and I would love to heard some samba beats or something to give it that international feel. Anney you got mad flava.
4,Radiating rhythms,"Ani DiFranco continues to evolve musically on her new CD set. Blending the jazz forms into which she's been delving with her folky-funky standards, she has here created a myriad of textured songs for her eager listeners. The ""Revelling"" CD speaks to me louder than the ""Reckoning"" CD, and overall there are fewer songs that immediately grab me like previous Ani CDs, and yet it's an entirely enjoyable experience, lyrically and rhythmically. Ani has not sounded so certain and steady for a while now."
4,Ani gets Jazzy,Love the jazzy flavor of this two disc set. Ani's voice still delivers. Nice touch adding trumpet to several tracks.
3,"Not an instant love, but it grows on you","Dilate is by far the most impressive Ani Difranco album ever put out there. This is a close second. It's hard to rate this because it has so many songs, there are bound to be some that you don't like. ""Marrow"", ""Garden of Simple"", ""Rock Paper Scissors"", and ""School Night"" are the most impressive on the 2 disc compilation. There are a few too many instrumental tracks, but maybe I only think that because Ani's lyrics are what I feel compelled to listen to, her music itself is just an added bonus. Good Cd. I'm not disappointed with it."
5,A must for any fan,"Ani has always been true to herself and her music with each album she produces (evidence of this is that she still produces her own records on her own label). This double set is definitely no exception. It is full of insightful lyrics, odd experimental pieces, heartbreaking images and personal revelation. It is personal and political in a very different way from ""To the Teeth"", which I found a little too aggressive and angry. This album is more assured, no less adamant, but a bit more civil. Some may say it lacks passion, but what it may be missing in raw energy, it makes up for in honesty and intelligence. Throw both discs in the player, kick back with the lyrics in hand and just enjoy the work of an artist. In the current climate of Britney's and Destiny's Child, it is a rare treasure to listen to a woman with a mind, heart, and more talent in one track than any of the pop girls can put together in a set of albums."
3,Wonderful--but old,"Stan Kenton has been a personal best artist in my life since I began listing to him in the 1940's. The music in this album is early Stan Kenton. If you love the first 10 years of the band you will love this album. But because his music got so much better over the years, as did all the big bands, I like the progressive jazz music in his later years."
2,Catchy song.... but thats about it,"I must admit that I have never really liked Willa Ford {yes i am a huge bsb fan, but i have nothing wrong with their girlfriends or in this case ex's} but i do like this song. the sad thing is when i saw her perform this song on TRL live, she can not sing! trust me i would give her the props if she could sing but she just can't! all she did was wear some really flashy clothes! use ur money wisely and go buy a christina aguilera album. i saw her live and she's the real thing. that girl CAN SING! Again i am not saying this just because she's nick's ex! i really don't care about that! I'm just saying they let anyone in the business now! That's my opinion and I'm sorry if you don't like it!"
1,bad? more like horrible,"this song is terrible. the only thing willa shows in this song is her body . nothing in the song shows that she has any real vocal talant. there's nothing that makes you go ""wow she can really sing"". you'd be better off buying a christina cd. she might show just as much skin but at least she has more than just her looks to showcase."
2,YOU ARE BAD,"WELL, I FIRST HEARD WILLA ON THE RADIO AND I KIND OF LIKED IT, BUT THEN I READ SOMEWHERE THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE CATAGORIZED WITH BRITNEY AND CHRISTINA,WELL,HELLO WILLA, YOU SOUND JUST LIKE THEM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE SAME GROUP GET A DIFFERENT SOUND."
4,"WIlla, weird name, cool tunes","I must admit, her name kinda threw me off and I thought it was a joke when she was Nick's girlfriend, but she is actually good at singing! ""I wanna be bad"" is just how to set the tone for your cd! This girl is already on TRL which may i say is hard especially when a cd isn't even out yet. She is set apart from Britney (good looks) and Christina (great voice) by having both a pretty face and a good voice. I hav a feeling she will be around for a while because she looks like she knows what she wants to do! you go girl!"
1,Oh no!,"Not another blond pin up pop artist pushed into the already bloated market. Willa/Christina/Britney/Jessica/Mandy all sing the same songs, written by the same MEN. The only difference is Willa ""wants"" to be bad, but she never quite pulls it off. Plus what is with the name? I know her real name is Amanda Williford. And of all the names she came up with- Willa?? That was the best? Please spare us the annoyance of allowing her to continue to pollute the airwaves with her sour notes."
5,Willa rocks!,"I first heard of Willa from being a Backstreet Boys fan. I have to admit that I was not a fan of hers at first, but then I listened to a sampler CD of hers that I picked up and heard a part of this song on it and I loved it instantly. Willa's sound is totally different from Britney or Christina, I don't think she should be put in that category at all. Her music has an edge to it, and it's all written by her. She has a great deal of talent and I think she's going to hit it big with her upcoming album. I've heard more than this song and they are all really good.This song is very catchy and both versions (rap and no rap) are awesome! Check out Willa if you haven't already! Give her a chance and don't diss just because she was Nick Carter's girlfriend!"
3,Willa Wants To Be Bad...,"...and she aims to make you dance while doing so. ""I Wanna Be Bad"" is a very catchy debut for the self-proclaimed ""Eminem of Girlpop"". The Eminem bit continues on to the guest rap by Royce Da 5' 9"", who makes some refrences to Eminem's hit singles ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"", to which she eagerly moans along to. To be honest, Willa is not a good artist by any stretch of the imagination, but she does have a nice enough tune on her hands with this one."
2,what I think,This song really dissapointed me. Willa shows poor vocal skills in this song and it dosn't sound like she has a large vocal range. The song is overproduced and the chorus is repeated way too many times. I wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money on this single.
1,So what's new? NOTHING!!,I was really hoping that the next female pop star on the market would have something new to offer...she doesn't. Her vocals are uninspiring. (she's not exactly Christina) She does write her own music. Although she isn't saying anything that hasn't already been said or delivering the message with any type of creativity. I don't feel that any true success is in her future but her album will sell well at first based on curiosity.
2,Another Song...,"This is another hit song that I don't understand why it's a hit. Sure, it's catchy, and a bit edgy, but in a trashy way. Plus she can't sing live, I could go into a recording studio and sound decent in the end. I am getting sick of blonde solo female singers that look good but have no true talent. Who signs these people? I would suggest artists like Alicia Keyes or Krystal Harris.Us girls need some true singers out there. Christina ruins it with her ditzyness, although she has a good voice. Britney can't sing, Jessica Simpson is often overlooked, and Mandy gets stuck with immature songs. You can't help but compare Willa Ford to them as a third rate clone that makes up for her lack of talent by showing some skin."
5,I wanna be bad isn't that bad,I've heard about willa ford mandah or whatever her name aka manduh at bsb fans on bsb sites willa is very hated by fellow bsb fans that she dated nick only that she could get a record deal............I think that her single rocks it's a catchy tune that can make u dance and sing along willa is another addition to the pop queens christina britney buy this single
2,Not much there in this single,I was disappointed in this single. It just isn't as great as it promised to be. Actually I lost it shortly after I bought it and I don't plan on replacing it.
4,Great song.,"For a first single, Willa Ford does a good job with the punding pop/R&B beat and cathcy lyrics. Well done."
3,Not so good with iMac,"Difficulté with accès to the menu on a Mac, but the scenes are interessting. Thesound is ok, price ok"
5,Things to do with the grandboys,I got this for my husband to do projects with our grandsons. He had books like these when he was a kid and they helped him see hiw things work and I thought he could use them to teach the grandsons whose dads are not as mechanical as he is. It's a great book!
4,Pinspot with bulb,This is a good buy.. Have been using this light for my mirrored ball and no problems as traveled with mobile dj equipment and no problems.. Is made well and feel heavy duty made. Good buy!
5,For everyone who loves to paint with watercolors,"If I had to sell all of my watercolor books except one, this is the one I would keep. Ms. Wunderlich takes the artist on a journey as if she understands that everyone needs to know both elementary and advanced techniques. Nothing is left out in her demonstrations as she easily SHOWS with wonderful pictures and TELLS with few words. I've been painting watercolors for two years, have borrowed or bought almost every book on the subject, have listened in classes, watched in seminars, and made every mistake possible until I got her book. Her simple demos gave me the greatest understanding of glazes/layering and texture application. I felt so confident with her guidance that my first painting was on a full sheet and became my favorite. The book's illustrations can be framed and referenced again and again. After I got this book, I sold and gave away half of my other watercolor books."
3,"Decent acting, terrible production","When I viewed this picture I enjoyed its interpretation of O'Connor's work quite thoroughly. However, I am saddened by the fact that the manner in which it was produced was so poor. It did not do justice to the profound themes of the story. On the other hand, I did admire the acting abilities of most involved in the film and wish that they could have had a better opportunity to display their skills."
3,Prince Goes Vegas,"Prince runs through hits and non-hits in an 11 minute jam. Interesting in its way, but not essential."
2,disappointed!!!,"As a Prince freak let me start off by saying that i love pretty much everything he's ever put out...genius! this is for the casual fans out there...i don't want to see anyone get ""juked"". THIS IS NOT A CD OF REMIXES OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS/BEATS. it's more like a dance remix you would hear at one of those annoying ""glow stick clubs""...i love Princes' music but this one is going to have to grow on me...I AM A HUGE FAN...IF YOU ARE NOT A HUGE FAN...U WANT 2 PASS ON THIS ONE...!...ONLY FOR U IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR...."
5,Excellent. A must 4 die hard Prince fans.,"This mix truly shows the capabilities of Prince's musical Genius. He really catches the mood of each song and knows how to make them flow, and also he adds a little extra flavor that wasn't there before to each song. Even though the track is 11 minutes long, you wouldn't notice it because each track catches your attention every few seconds."
1,The Artist,"With the court despute settled it seems that the ""Artist"" did not like the outcome of the decision. Little known fact is that Prince was in fact two performers ( American Banstand Dick Clark. And thier work is divided for instance, Under the cherry moon directed by Prince featuring the ""Artist"" and Purple Rain written & directed by Morris Day.This accounts for the lack of symetry when listening to the music. All of Prince photos are numbered and usually found on the inside of the album.Later desputes arose when the Artist wanted to use Prince songs for a ballet.All numbered music is also Controversy Music is different from the Artist."
5,another great transformers animated movie,i am glad to see that they are making more animated movies about the transformers this film was a great entry to the transformers movie universe. This film had everything action adventure some comedy. i really recommand this movie for any transformer fan
2,Why is he mute?,This might be worth obtaining if they'd get rid of that mute Bumblebee foolishness that Bayformers tacked on as a gimmick that went nowhere.
2,Not for audiophiles,"The Trekstor i.beat is a cheaply made player. The primary problem I have with it is when you turn it on it continuously hisses like an old tape player. When music is playing it is not as noticeable as when paused, between tracks or in the menu. The volume is another problem. Its loud, which is not usually a bad thing but turned down to its lowest volume (1) is sometimes too loud for some music. I really like the size and the backlit screen, but the menu is awkward and basic. The cap covering the usb plug is strong and stays on very well. Overall, its a good player for the money, but cheap parts again make a bad product."
4,Great sounding headphones,"These are lightweight, comfortable, and produce good sound. The volume control is a must for me and works great. The durability is on the light side. But at the low price is a bargain."
3,"Decent stock, price is too high for me though","Ordered this stock thinking it would be a great way to mod my 10/22 for plinking and whatnot. Problems are with the iron sights, scope mounting and pistol grip. Firstly the iron sights are made of cheap blocky plastic along with everything else that comes with this stock which makes the accuracy of said iron sights a little helter skelter. So i decided to mount a small scope off of one of my older .22 rifles and it fit the mount just fine but the way the scope mounts i cannot zero it in, got it centered but it still hits about 6 inches low at 75-100 yards. And finally do not order if you plan on using anything more than the ruger 10 round mags, tried to fit my 32 round mag into it and i had to slot the pistol grip to make it fit."
2,my experience!!!,"really not a bad design just the trigger pull is just plain unusable. I am talking 20 lbs plus. It was really fun for me to shoot as a grown male, but i bought it thinking it would be easy for my daughter to use and it was not even close usable. Could not fit the 25rnd mags with out pistol grip mods(extensive)."
1,Pure garbage,This has got to be the cheapest made stock I have ever seen I do not recommend it and am going to just throw it away!
4,As advertised,I had no issues with the install. It does feel a LITTLE cheapish ( the plastic) but certainly performs fine. I have fired only about 50 ronds through it with any issues. I would def. reccomend to a friend.
5,does it work with the...,"10/22 carbine version of the rifle or just the rifle version? i was disappointed when i could not buy the mg 42 dress up kit, so i switched to thisbecause i own the carbine version"
2,Wish it was better,Great concept...execution not so much. The trigger ended up creepy and loose. I took it off and put it back on the original stock.
2,"Good Idea, bad product.","Everything is plastic. I had to shave a piece down to get it to fit. The trigger is plastic and the trigger transfer bar is plastic. The ""Iron"" sights are plastic and the rail attachment is plastic. I guess it is cool to just shoot for fun, but you basically turn an accurate, useful 10/22 into a non accurate, not useful, dangerous toy. I love the idea of a bull pup stock, but this is a piece of crap."
5,Buddy Guy reborn ?,"I saw Buddy Guy some years ago at Peer, the biggest blues festival in Belgium. It wasn't bad but it was showbusiness. I couldn't appreciate his (good) imitations of all the famous guitar players. The music was not bad, nothing more. I bought 'Slippin' in' and I liked it. Good music, good drive, real blues. But... nothing more. I heard Sweet Tea at the CD shop and... WAW! Is this the Buddy Guy i knew? No! It's another one. The one who has the blues in every vein. The one who isn't afraid of some risks. This is real! This goes to the inside of your brain and hits you in your stomach. A 12 minute song... and not a second too long. Since then I listen every day. Long time I heard some music moving me so deep. Wicked of Shemekia some months ago and now Sweet Tea... this is really a great blues year!"
3,Buy a Kimbrough CD and get it over with,"Great, so Buddy has found what Junior Kimbrough and T-Model Ford sound like and he trys his best to duplicate them, especially Junior. Thing is, he ain't got the voice, or it's not recorded right for the sound he got from the guitar. Sure, the guy can play, but you know what, I prefer listening to Junior's CD's than this ... stuff. Kimbrough died last year (I think it was last year) so already his bones are getting picked. Looking at the raves this thing is getting, I would say most of ya'll haven't heard the real thing. In my humble opinion, I think ""Stone Crazy"" is the best thing Guy has ever done were he got to sing, but not this. His best work is backing up Junior Wells on ""Hoodoo Man Blues"" which is almost universally a blues desert island disc."
5,Amazing,"This is one of my favorite blues cd's period. The electric guitar cries in buddies hands, its amazing, this is a must have for any buddy fans."
4,Sweet Buddy,"Buddy Guy is a rock and roll hall of famer, and this CD brings out some unique aspects of his abilities. It takes several listening sessions to start appreciating this. This CD grows on you after awhile. I like it!"
2,What were they thinking???,"This is not something Buddy would ever have done on his own. It is a phenomenal failure. The producer should be executed. I am a huge huge Buddy Guy fan... and I was looking forward to a change from the overproduced superstar sessions of late. I also love the original Fat Possum versions of these songs. Buddy says it best in recent interviews... he had never heard these songs before & didn't really appreciate them, but he said he'd give it a try for the producer. Execute the producer. Save your cash and go get some of the old Chess stuff or Stone Crazy. Sorry Buddy! You are still the greatest!"
5,Hear what you've been missing,"I will keep this short.....If you want to hear where rock n roll came from and where it should've gone, listen to this album. Baby Please Don't Leave Me and I Gotta Try You Girl belong in every serious blues lovers collection."
3,As good as it can GET!,"This is IT! The Blues left the Delta,went to Chicago and became something different(but better!)It came back to the Delta but got off ONE station short of Clarksdale! The combination of Delta influences,Chicago influences AND the eerie influence of the North Mississippi Hill country Blues is an unbeatable combination! This is like a GREAT mixture of Marvin Pontiac,Muddy Waters and a super player like Buddy Guy!.The best of ALL three worlds!I don't think there is a category for this kind of music at the Grammys,but,they better come up with one! I haven't been this excited about a new recording since""Electric Mud""(Muddy's First Electric Album!). I know that dates me,but,I'm serious.This is some great stuff and if you think you have ever heard something like this before,please let me know where I can find it! If you like Buddy Guy,Delta Blues,Chicago blues OR Marvin Pontiac,you had BETTER buy this CD! I will not profit from this review unless you enjoy the CD as much as I did!"
5,Great Swamp Blues,"This CD is different from Guy's other music I have listened to - it is not the Chicago Blues with brass and back-up singers but a more stripped down, ""roots"" blues with a swampy feel - I think the whole CD is great - the grooves are very hypnotic - I can almost feel the humidity and smell the stale swamp air! In the first song Guy sings about being old and used up - but the rest of the CD puts the lie to that assessment! I would like to hear more like this!"
5,Buddy Guy can still smoke it!,"Sweet Tea showcases Buddy Guy's sound filtered through some vintage amps. The sounds from these experiments are incredible. Warm tones and a whole lot of reverb. Sure, this isn't Mr. Guy's signature sound. He's never this dirty or greasy. There has been always almost a polished sound to his music. A bit unstable at times, but always finished beautifully. A lot of people will complain about how he is tying to sound like so and so. But without men like Buddy Guy, there wouldn't be men like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, etc. etc. So when you listen to him burn up his Strat like he usually does, realize that you are listening to a living legend. And with the man being in his mid 60's, not a single young guitar player, professional or otherwise, can touch him."
3,Preying on the Less Fortunate!,"I like Buddy Guy, but I think it is pretty unconscionable for a guy who has made several hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to rip off the current work of lesser known artists. If Buddy wanted to help these artists or promote them in any way, he could either tour with them or invite them to perform on his CD. For my money, I will take the originals any day. Downgraded for a lack of originality."
2,Makes Me Miss Junior Kimbrough,"I wanted to like this record, especially after the slavish praise heaped upon it by the... community, as well as various blues publication. Hailed by many as a return to Buddy's roots, I think this is true if you think Buddy's roots date to the early 90s. While recording the music of various Fat Possum artists is a nice marketing ploy, Guy doesn't approach any of the original versions in terms of gutbucket power. His versions of Junior Kimbrough's Hill trance drones only make me miss Kimbrough all the more.It was once said of Buddy Guy that he plays guitar like he's trying to catch a plane. I think his recent ouput sounds more like he's trying to crash a plane, and all the bombast and sonic lightning and amplification in the world can't replace tasteful playing and production."
5,Nature unleashed,"Sweet Tea is a masterpiece, that is a must for any Blues Collection or guitar players ensamble. Known mostly for his electrfying live performance's, Buddy Guy steps out with the help of Fat Possum Records to provide an historical testomony to his brilliant talents. Intentially produced in a raw, open vibrant, truely Hendrix spirited affair he opens with a misdirected solo to lead the listener astray, but what follows is as though the heavens opened up and poured down rifts of his soul. Certainly the BEST Blues album of this year and of years past including another excellent recording on Fat Possum Records by R.L. Burnside ""Wish I was in heaven sitting down"". I know its asking alot whenever Clapton puts out an album the same year but this one deserves the Grammy. My only regreat is that Muddy Waters has passed and never recorded in the hill country of North Mississippi with the current producers at Fat Possum."
2,"Awesome idea, but ...","The idea of Buddy Guy exploring the raw roots of the north Mississippi artists in Fat Possum's stable - seven of the nine songs are by Fat Possum artists - is an outstanding one. I couldn't wait to hear how Guy approached it. Alas, Guy injects all of the excesses fans have moaned about on this, a disc which is certainly not outright bad (two and a half stars would be right) but must qualify as disappointing. The acoustic opener is quite fine, but after that comes pseudo-blues amped up to 11, like music of rumblings and squallings echoing to our ears out of some tunnel that goes straight to hell. The vicious sound is at times alarming. Buddy Guy tries too hard to peel the wallpaper, engages in too much rock-oriented guitar histrionics, and, rather than keeping it simple and raw, like country blues, he tries to be ultra modern, ultra cool, super nasty, with vocal effects and colossal guitar sounds all over the place. Hey, just play the blues. Remember ""Slippin' In""? I do."
5,Moron,"I read the two star of this album and had to respond, 1st) the acoustic quality of the CD is fantastic, 2nd) the track selection isn't so much an album as it is a selection and statement on different aspects of the blues, 3rd) Buddy Guy puts so much soul into this album that I find my B&K amp haunted by him later.This is one of the best Blues CDs of the past 10 years."
2,"Bad production, songs, unsuitable to Buddy's style","Buddy Guy is great.This album is not.I found the production, especially the overabundance of reverb and effects, unsuitable to Buddy.I don't know what they were thinking. I can see why after this he recorded the acoustic Blues Singer album, as this experience could not have been a pleasant one."
4,"Straight, RAW blues album.","This album is for the die-hard blues fan. Probably Buddy's best ever. The sound quality is raw, intense, and as hypnotic as any album I've heard in quite a while. BUY IT!"
4,Shades of the possum,"This is realy good stuff. For real blues fans ONLY> But, go and buy a Fat Possum sampler and hear the original artists play these songs. Kimbrough is fantastic. Belfour, Payton, and all of the Possum lineup are well worth the effort to find. You can see how important these previously forgotten bluesmen are when Buddy Guy takes such a big risk as covering their dark blue material. Hats off to Buddy for a fine album. Now, go out and search for the Poddum guys before its too late!"
5,Sweet Tea,"Probably one of his best albums due to a very raw style.Especially I likethe song ""I gotta try You girl"",which is over 12 minuts and the volume onmy CD-player is turned high and the song is on repeat.Fantastic song forplaying the air-guitar"
2,sweet tea buddy guy,"like buddy's last concert in albuquerque left wondering if my money could of been better spent. not done it the spirt of what most buddy guy fans expect. we want hard licks on the git box and the words of a blues man making us listen to here our own blues, hey we all get old but come on buddy get old on your time this is mine and you are the greatest, be the greatest and play that guitar like you know you can, damn right i got the blues."
5,Made a Great Wedding Cake,"I used this product for a wedding cake and it turned out fabulously. No one could believe I started with a cake mix. I did add almond and butter flavoring to the mix, and it really was delicious when baked."
5,The Best,"I have read just about every book worth reading on this subject, and this is the best. Francis Davis is a fabulous writer, and his opinions are worth considering, even when you don't agree with them. Most books that attempt to cover ""The Blues"" in its entirely can be tedious, and read like textbooks. Davis manages to bring this material to life, placing it a broader social context, while still covering almost everything that needs covering. Bottom line: a great read, as well as a great reference book."
3,"A Good, but sometimes tedious read.","With this book, Davis sets himself the daunting task of chronicling one of America's greatest forms of musical expression. The book is informative, but sometimes you'd wish that he'd dwell more on the bluesmen he writes about who are often dismissed with a 2-3 sentence description or a brief anectode. An interesting aspect of this book is Davis' treatment of Presely whom he considers to be great blues singer. He is definitely right because we do tend to often forget that Elvis was ACTUALLY TALENTED. Muddy Waters & Robert Jonhson get a lot of coverage in this book. All things said, buy this book if you are at home with a writer who can talk abourt 10 bluesmen on 2-3 pages."
4,good book,"nice book, easy to read, a bit academic, thou not to much.had a good time reading it.liked it a lot"
5,sativa luvbox beloved satelite,"Supplement to any kommunity fk fan's collection. Mata shines as a sparkeling lyrical and vocal gem on this musically quasi grunge album. a must for anyone interested in Pat Mata's career. some parts of this cd are like pink floyd meets soundgarden, or even red hot chilli peppers and jane's addiction, all these combined with PM's vocals. Like the light shining in on his darkness, we witness more of his vocal range and stylings than his classically goth prior recordings. An attempt to sell out? I hope so, he deserves credit for his pioneering tunes. This guy should always go for it, he rox."
3,Unique,"I used to be in a band with the lead singer of this band, Patrick Mata. I was the lead guitar player. Our band was called HOT SHASTA. We haunted the music scene in Hollywood in the early 70's. After Hot Shasta broke up Pat went on to start the band Sativa Luvbox. He has since gone on to Community FK. Patrick has always been a visionary and runs screaming from mainstream music. He is always looking for a different sound and a unique connection with his audience. Inspired by David Bowie, which you can hear on this recording, Patrick comes up with some good stuff. He is an amazing singer and I believe that this recording does not show off his vocal talents enough. I enjoy listening to this and it is too bad it never got much recognition. Patrick will do what he wants in the music business and he doesn't care who likes it or who doesn't like it. Take him or leave him, I think this CD is worth a listen."
4,A sweet story,"This conclusion to the Scottish Crown series was very good. I looked forward to reading this for so long and i finally finished it! The book takes you through the life of Keifer, a boy who must go and foster with Adam and Gwenyth (The characters from the first book).When he is there he meets Adam and Gwenyth's daughter Nola, who he considers to be just an annoying eight year old. Through time the two become great friends,and Nola helps him thorugh the bitterness he has about his Father dying. This is a very touching and sweet story, a bit predictable at times, but still good. A must-read."
2,rather large for a finger puppet,"This penguin finger puppet looks great; however, as a person with small-medium size hands (wear a S/M glove size), the puppet is too long to manipulate with one finger. I bought two of them to use as a teaching tool in my elementary-age classroom and they are just too long to serve the purpose. Unless, you have long fingers or don't plan to use them as finger puppets, I don't recommend the purchase."
3,"Easy listening, unessential Marion Brown","This is Marion Brown at the beginning of his decline. He had difficulty playing, and it shows -- he doesn't do much playing here and when he does, it is slower material. His beautiful tone is still intact, and his beautiful soul shine through on ""Ode To Coltrane"" and momentarily on some other tunes, but the angular and unexpected lines are in short supply. The support band are all young guys, all adept players, yet no one comes through as being particularly original. Overall, it's a pretty program, good date music. If this is all you want from an album, then buy it. But if you're more demanding, this is far from Marion Brown's best."
5,Favorite toy,"My son is 23 years old and is serverly handicapped, however he still loves this bear. He listens to it every night. We have purchased many versions Teddy Ruxpin over the past 20 years. The new Teddy is much easier to use and does not require adult intervention to make it run. It has large colorful buttons that are clearly marked. It is also sturdy enough to withstand abuse. I hope this Teddy is not discontinued, he makes my sons life a little more pleasurable."
4,He's back!,"I had one of the original Teddy Ruxpin bears back in 1985. I was three years old and remember him very well. I even had Grubby when he came out too (yes, I was spoiled). I listened to them so much that they eventually wore out and stopped working. I'm a Reading Specialist for elementary students now... go figure, right! Rock on Teddy! You set me off on the right foot and I'm happy to see it still exists."
1,Very disappointing,I bought this for my goddaughter and it never worked properly. The sound was so low you couldn't hear it and then stopped working altogether. I sent back once but same thing happened with replacement. Unfortunately as it was a gift they didn't tell me so the second never got replaced. A complete was of money and one I really regret
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this product under the Impression that it was and/The Original Teddy Ruxpin...I am 32 years old (still a kid at heart) Teddy Ruxpin was such a Very Special part of My childhood and so I was almost moved to Tears when I received this ""Teddy Ruxpin"". He is smaller, a good bit smaller than the Original Teddy Ruxpin, smaller features-nose,mouth, eyes, body....however, the songs and books are the same. Sound quality is good. I have only taken it out of the box once, so now I am in the process of seeing what I want to do with this product at the is point...if you don't care whether it is The Original the I am sure you would enjoy this product...I believe it is good quality - just not what I wanted."
3,"Good toy, Poor Customer Service","I got two Teddy Ruxpin from this vendor. The vendor was fine, but the customer service at Teddy Ruxpin is very bad. A few weeks after I got both of the bears, they both started making strange sound. I wrote to the customer service at Teddy Ruxpin, the customer service never response to my e-mail to give me a return authorization number for me to send back the toy for repair. If anyone do buy a Teddy Ruxpin, when is not working, don't even think about send it back. You need to buy a new one."
1,$70? you got to be kidding me!,"I was very excited to see Teddy coming back, he was so cool in the 80s. Unfortunately, he just doesn't measure up to today's toys. I wanted to expose my daughter to reading, but Teddy comes with two books, one in color with pictures and no words, one in black and white with the words. Kate has no interest in the black and white version - how is this going to help her learn to read? Also, volume is very low and he's a lot smaller than he used to be - NOT a good value!!!"
3,"Cool, but not convinced it will work for long.","I bought my daughter a Teddy Ruxpin in the 80's. It was a very fun toy, but it wasn't long before one eye no longer blinked, so we put a patch over it and made it a ""pirate"" Ruxpin. A month ago I was so excited to see an updated Teddy Ruxpin is back! I bought three of them as Christmas gifts for my grandkids. Out of the three, two of them didn't work properly. I figured out that one had a faulty cartridge,(sound, but no movement) and one just didn't work no matter what I did. When it works it is very fun, but I am wondering, if they come out of the box with problems, how long they will fuction when kids are playing with them. It costs $40 to send them back to the company for repair, which is more than I paid originally. Hmmmm"
5,Great show,"If you love animated series buy this. Its full of drama, action, and good acting, and amazing storylines. I loved it."
5,its about time,iv been waiting for years for this to get releasted.i just hope it all gets released this time.and in the right order.so far it looks good.i hope we dont have to wait long.this is the one that started it all.and i still have not seen the last episode.the sooner they release them the sooner ill buy them.i have no ideal why it took so long to release all of it.but im over joyed its comeing.*** Update ***well as always they have to mess things up.the first two box sets are in order but the 3rd and 4th have a few out of order.this show picks up where they left off and when there out of order it mess's up the show.be glad im not your boss id fire you.anyway lucky for yall im buying them anyway.but im mad as hell at you guys.whats so hard about keeping them in order?i mean they are in vloume box sets after all.
3,I hope!,"I hope that these upcoming volumes (1&2)of Marvel X-men are full episodes in the order that they were originally released.It would be a great series to release with all seasons.If these are random episodes just put together I would not recommend buying them!I am not sure why it is such a problem to have all the 80's & 90's Marvel cartoons released in the way they should be.On ""Amazon - United Kingdom"" they started to release all the classic Marvel cartoons with full seasons and in correct order.(But you need a dvd player that plays a PAL formated disc.)Please release these the right way or not at all!"
5,finally here,i loved these cartoons as i was growing up and its finnaly here and its awesome. this is when there were good cartoons on tv i cant wait till they bring out all the seasons.
5,X-Men Vol. 1,"Everything about the X-Men is on point. This is the best thing that I've done by purching this DVD. Now I'm looking for more. What would make it a complete set, is that if I could get The Dark Phoenix Saga on DVD. Then and only then I will be truly complete. Thank you guys at Amazon for everything that you've done for me. You're the BEST. The fact that I know what you can do, ""I'll be back"". Once again thank you. Elroyah"
3,Throughly Good,This is defintely the best redntion of the XMen the art and voice acting was bsolutley stellar I enjoyed it thoroughly
5,Best X-Men Cartoon Ever!,"If you are looking for quality cartoon replacements for the garbage being shown on TV today, look no further than this entire series from Marvel! The original 90's cartoon series of X-Men delivers incredible artwork, subtle lessons in life and isn't something you need to be scared to let even the youngest child watch! I purchased this for my 4-year old and even my 2-year old loves it! Both are big fans of super heroes and thoroughly enjoy seeing these shows! And for me, it brings back memories of when I watched it live each Saturday morning! It certainly beats most anything out there today and ranks up there with great 80's cartoons like Thundercats, Silverhawks and He-Man. Marvel got it right when they put this one out there, and Disney didn't manage to screw it up!"
5,Thankyou Marvel!,"The first thing you'll notice when you watch the very first episode, if you didn't already know this, is that the movies are HORRIBLE. Don't get me wrong, they're good movies. They just don't follow.. well, anything. They somehow took rogue and put her in jubilee's position. The casting was all off. They just throw random characters in places where they don't belong. Everyone who watches this series would give it five stars and agree with me that Marvel should be returned rights to X-Men an Spider-Man movies. All five volumes are worth the money. I promise!"
5,The best of X-Men,I loved it. I asked my friend to find some episodes but he could not find them. Then I bought this and the episodes I wanted were all on it. That was awesome.
3,glittery but not shallow,"Very special edition, no extras, but the box compensates with everything... it's noticable that they made the edition thinking about the fans of this serie. The only thing missing, is the audio in Spanish of Spain, not only spanish of SouthAmerica... but for the rest, is almost a perfect edition :)"
4,The problem with starting an comic film or Tv is staying true to the story line,Followed the basic story line of the comic. Which is how the knowlegablyfans will do with any thing that marvel will put out
5,NOW....VERY HAPPY,It very good to be proven wrong. Very happy that Disney decided to keep all the episode in order!! That keeps a lot of fans from being very disappointed. Anyway....THIS IS A FANTASTIC SHOW and everyone should buy.Enjoy!
5,awesome!,"i think this will be the greatesr dvd release in history. i watched this everyday after school and on saturday morning cartoons along with eek the cat, and life with louie. ive actually had the xmen series for 3 years now off dvdsontv.com. it cost about 40 bucks for burnt ones. there are alot more episodes on those? but i will be purchasing these cuz of the case. i also think that should be xmen 1&2 on blu-ray since that put the third"
3,Why volumes instead of seasons?,"Take a look at the episode listings. Volume 1 includes all of Season 1 and the first few episodes of Season 2. Volume 2 includes the rest of season 2 and the first quarter of Season 3. Who decided upon this crappy scheme? Why is Marvel releasing ""volumes"" of seemingly random length (the ""Ren & Stimpy method""), when they should be releasing proper seasons like Gargoyles, Exo Squad, Transformers, etc. have done?Grr. X-Men is a great show and all, but seriously, ""volumes"" suck. Hopefully, Marvel will release a proper ""complete series"" box set like Warner did with B:TAS."
3,Mixed Blessing.,"I've watched this show recently, and it doesn't really feel like anything great. It's got plenty of corny bits (""Got bit by a dog, too.""), and the quality, to me, hasn't really held up like that other great '90's cartoon (Batman: TAS, for those of you that dunno what I'm talking about). The show feels stale, and not fresh, but it's worth a nostalgia dip. Kids today probably won't really care about this as much, with the modern Wolverine cartoon being out (why it's Wolverine and the X-Men, I don't know, because every X-cartoon out there stars good ol' Sniktbub). It was cool to see Mr. Sinister and many of the X-Men done in something at last, but for me, the older ""Kitty Pryde and the X-Men"" pilot is far better in terms of animation and story.In closing, just get it if you're a nostalgia buff, not an X-Fan."
4,Modern Day Nat King Cole,this Man can Sign anything&play equal to that as well. He does aGreat Re-make on this Van Morrison classic. Brian Mcknight to me is the 2nd Baddest All Around Musical Force over the past 20 years to R.Kelly. Brian Mcknight is to Nat King cole as R.Kelly is to Sam Cooke with the ability musically to cover so many bases&Styles. this is a really good cover.
5,cloe dana yasmin,yas cloe and dana are not the only hairflair babyz there are also nevra meygan sasha roxxi and jade i really want nevra but i havent seen the actuall dolls just the cartoons and i want hairflair triipletz i want them allbratzboy34
1,Babys... with HAIR?!,"Well, as cute as this doll is... is it really pratical to have a baby with hair? So what if it's a toy, can't the company make it a little more realistic? I'm also going to address the skimpy little clothes they put on the dolls. Why can't they just wear diapers or long frilly dresses like normal babies?Overall I think this whole Bratz baby thing is quite strange. I'm a big fan of the regular bratz, but I give the bratz babies 2 thumbs down. When I got this as a birthday present I rushed right back to the store and returned it."
5,Love it,"She is so cute! I love the real hair, I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says ""I luv you mama""."
5,omg!,This is definatly the most cutiest bratz baby ever! Her crimped blonde hair is so cute with a pretty little silver crown. Her blue eyes make her stand out and her baby outfit is very stylish! i love this baby cloe!**Emmma***
3,Pages fell apart upon arrival,The glue on the hinge of the book completely failed. Pages came apart the first time I opened the book. What a mess!
2,Binding of the book broke,The information and illustrations inside the book are wonderful. Every page you turn to has something that sparks your interest. Only downfall was that I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and the second time he opened the book to read out of it the binding broke.
1,Tiny Writing,"Good gosh, it's nearly impossible to read anything in this book. Most of the letters are barely a millimeter high, and the picture captions are even worse. What a waste!"
5,Universe,"`Universe' is part of the amazing DK reference book series that covers many topics in a big book format. This book is simply incredible. It is extremely easy to read through and perfect to dip into when you have a spare hour, but it may be best to leave a couple of hours free as you'll get so engrossed. It covers such a variety of topics in a rich and engaging way and this book is worth buying for the photos alone. The photos really are stunning and you may find yourself gaping at the stunning imagery. You may also feel, as I did, humbled by the sheer scale and beauty of the images depicted and it really puts into perspective the size of the universe and our tiny place within it. This is another great coffee table book to be picked up and enjoyed whenever you can!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Great book -- bad binding,"This book has so much information. The text is great, the images are great, but I'm afraid to touch it since it is literally falling out of it's binding. The second time I opened it, I noticed the glue was undone from the binding. This is a really good book so I'm going to take it to a book binder and have it redone. I've seen this problem posted before, so it's common enough to be an issue. I heard the paperback version is solid, but who want paperback in a book of this kind? Get this book if you love astronomy and DK books in general, and pray that you get a quality copy. 5 stars with good binding, 4 with bad binding."
5,Awesome book!!!,"This book jumped off the shelf and into my arms, begging me to look through it. Boy, am I glad I did. Astronomy and Space is a hobby of mine, and even I was struck with awe when I began zipping through the pages.If you want a book to tell you about almost every facet of astronomy there is, this is the book. It has enough information to explain a concept, but not too much so you get overloaded with ""astronomy-ese.""It's also loaded with pictures, in typical DK fashion. And some of the pictures are awesome too, because the Hubble Space Telescope is the originator of some of the pictures and, thanks to NASA, we have Hubble as a fabulous window to our Universe.I don't think your budding astronomer would be disappointed if you bought him/her this book for the upcoming holidays or for a birthday, etc. Or, be like me and buy one for yourself!!!"
3,Fantastic book......horrible binding,"A fantastic and interesting book for all! I love how the content is presented and the stunning pictures. The font is a bit small in places but there is so much information packed into this book it is well worth buying. I give 5 stars for the content but unfortunately the binding on this book is terrible. After about the 3rd time opening it, the binding has come apart. I'm sure the pages will start to fall out soon enough. I'll have to take off 2 stars for the poor quality of the binding. I purchased the paperback version. I'm not sure if the hard cover would have a better binding."
2,Print too small,The content looks fine in this book and there are plenty of colorful pictures but the print is too small. I have to use a magnafying glass to read it.
5,Great coffee table book,This book is amazing. Its pictures are beautiful and explanations clear.I leave it on my coffee table as the pictures are so beautiful and on every page. I would suggest this book for especially persons that have not had previous knowledge of the universe as this explains it all in understandable detail. Good for all ages except the very young.
5,Amazing!!!,A monumental effort. Well worth the cost even if one was forced to pay the full retail price for this book. Everything that can be said has been said by others. I'm just here to add my 5 star to a well deserving book
5,Beautiful and packed with useful data,"I think this lavish one volume astronomy encyclopedia needs no more praise than it already have, absolute five stars, best value you can get for its price. So I will give only a personal testimony of it practical utility: I was entertaining friends at home with my old refraction telescope. We saw Venus and the Moon. The sky was dim and polluted, so apparently there was no other object worth seeing, so I decided to give this book a chance. I consulted it sky guide and in less then five minutes was able to localize and show to my friends the magnificently ringed Saturn!"
2,pretty bad,"I couldn't sit through this movie with my kids. They thought it was okay, but prefer Sonic X. These are grainy and poorly written. I can usually sit through about anything, but I only lasted 10 minutes on this one. I would recommend the Sonic X movies as they are better quality, more exciting and overall easier to watch."
3,"An ""ok"" Stamp...difficult to use on single pieces of paper.","Bought this to sequentially number packaging for my wife's business. It works, but, isn't a great as it probably should be. I have inked it several times and it still doesn't always stamp all 5 numbers. And if you only try it on one piece of paper on a hard surface it is horrible.I'd buy it again...but only because we like the way it looks when it drops numbers or only stamps 1/2 a number. If you are relying on it to print cleanly...look elsewhere."
1,Junk,I needed a numbering machine with the option of zeros appearing or disappearing at will. This machine has the option of depressing the zeros. But once you depress the zeros there's no way to turn them back on. They remain depressed for good. There's also no blank. So I contacted Sparco. My call has not been retuned since three days ago. I suppose they're stuck with those zeros. This a useless piece of equipment heading for the trash bin in no time.
4,Good anthology of Melville short stories,"This volume is reasonably priced, includes all the short stories a high school student needs and is in a very compact form. Although Melville's style does not easily lend itself to today's reader, the stories are good. Upon completion, you can actually feel a sense of accomplishement. Sort of like running a marathon. Tough to get through but feeling good about having done it."
4,TIMELESS CLASSIC,"I have never found Melville easy or enjoyable to read; his books are almost like a required course in college in English 101, sometimes tedious and over-descriptive. His early books were not commercially successful but he continued to write, and usually involved themes of good vs. evil. Of course, time has shown that ""Moby Dick"" and ""Pierre,"" as well as ""Billy Budd, Sailor,"" are now considered American classics of literature. Billy is accused of murdering Master John Claggart and is unable to defend himself properly, and ends up executed on the HMS ""Bellipotent."" Other stories are in the book also: ""The Bell-Tower,"" ""The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,"" ""The Piazza,"" etc., all of which give us insight to the early times on the sea, but the too-formal style of writing can be exasperating. I would say that if you prioritize your books for reading, this one, although classic, should be near the bottom of the stack."
4,Juicy nuggets of goodness.,"By a freak chance, this collection of stories was my first exposure to Melville. My impression was most favourable. Each of the stories here is eloquent and deep, whether it be a gazette-like overview of the Galapagos or the thrilling story of a revolt on a slaver-ship. Melville's style, wordy and full of Biblical diction, rang pretentious at times, even for 19th-century prose, but was over all delicious to read."
4,Don't listen to the first rating!!!!!,"Billy Budd is NOT a story of ""good versus evil""! If you read it and only get that out, you're an idiot. Furthermore, this was Melville's very last work and was not found until after his death; it is heralded as being just as well-written and compelling as ""Moby Dick"". The ship is a microcosm for our world, and each character represents different people/ideas. It is not a story of protagonist and antagonist. Melville was not concerned with Claggart or Budd, but rather Captain Veere. Heck, just read until the court martial scene; you'll see.In closing: Forget the loon who told you this book was nonesense. He/she apparently has never READ the book for UNDERSTANDING.PS: I'm a college sophomore majoring in English. I should know what I'm talking about. Toodles."
1,Billy's Not MY Buddy,"If you are an English teacher who is looking for a good punishment for their students, I highly recommend that you assign them 'Billy Budd.'Not only is this book extremly hard to understand, it's theme is also quite depressing... it's your basic everyday, good vs. evil, but in this book: Evil conquers all.Save your time.. don't read this book...."
5,It's business time!,"Forget Dylan, Lennon, Mannilow, and Yankovic, FOTC are the greatest songwriters of all time (except for the Finn Brothers). You'll enjoy their making light of every musical style from Pet Shop Boys (Innercity Pressure), to French ephemera (Fa Do FA FA), to Jethro Tull (Prince of Parties).""Hey Pretty Prince of Parties, can I come to your party?""""NO""But you can own this amazing set of episodes that makes the Monkees look like the Bananna Splits! For adults only, unless you want to explain ""Threesees"" to the kids!"
3,No extras? Why?,"Five stars for the show, zero stars for the disappointment in discovering that the set has zilch in terms of extras. C'mon HBO! Will there be a Super Deluxe Mega Fan Club Edition next month that will cost me even more?! There are more goodies on the HBO website than in this package. I'm a big fan of the guys, but I feel ripped off."
1,Not Worth it,"Despite plenty of possible extras to include on the DVD (previous HBO specials, MTV specials, BBC radio program, + more) HBO included NOTHING in this DVD package except the episodes themselves. No commentaries. Nothing. It's a waste unless you haven't seen the show before, in which case you're in for a treat."
4,These guys are real originals...,"And nothing but quirky fun! We heard some good buzz about this series, and caught most of the episodes on TV. We just howled through most of them- there were only a couple that were not as consistently funny. This is pretty offbeat humor- but we loved it, and decided we wanted to own it."
5,Flight of the Kings!,"These guys are just classic funny. Subtle, but funny.Great session 1, I really hope they make a second session.No bonus stuff on the DVD which was kind of disappointing."
4,Flight of the Conchords,"These guys are hilarious. Buy the DVD though, cuz their live show tickets are ridiculously expensive."
4,Awesome,"The product came in two separate DVD cases and the covers looked like it was printed on, but if all they had was the DVDs then I appreciated the effort to make it look nice. They run great and no marks. It's great."
5,Flight of The Chonchords,"IF YOU'RE A FAN OF FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORD'S THEN YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO MISS YOKO. ENOUGH SAID! JUST DOWNLOAD THIS EPISODE AND ENJOY, IF YOU'RE A FAN THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS EPISODE, IT'S WORTH IT! FUNNY STUFF FROM BEGINNING TO END."
5,Flight of the Conchords,"Love, Love, Love these guys!!! They are soo funny!! Check out Episode 3 with the rap and how little slave kids are making all the shoes, but they're not much cheaper, what are their ""overheads"". I can watch this DVD over and over again. I love it!!"
4,LOVED it!,"These guys are hilarious! I absolutely LOVE the first disc, which is mostly written by Brent and Jermaine, but I didn't click as much with the second one, possibly because it was written by some other people. Anyway, it's worth the buy and it's definitely worth the laughs!"
5,Comic and Musical Genius from a Jemainiac,"My husband and I adore this show. It is an absolute gem and rates with Arrested Development and Sex and the City as one of the best TV series in my lifetime. Conchords is totally unique and mixes Jemaine and Bret's side-splitting songs with stories of the group trying to get its break in NYC. The songs ""Crying"", ""Robot Boogie"", and ""Hottest girl in the Room"" are particular standouts, but each song in the series is whimsically depicted set against their hilarious lyrics. You must watch this show!"
4,Very Funny - Not So Much As HBO Special,"This is a pretty funny show. The plot of each episode is contrived to fit two songs from their *actual* folk-comedy duo days, with only a few jokes in the dialogue. I think the versions of the songs here are far inferior to the ones in their HBO live special (two of them with a blue background of new york). Until that's released, you're pretty much stuck with this.On the other hand, for someone who's never heard the songs prior, this is absolutely hilarious...""They're turning kids into slavesjust to make cheaper sneakers,But what's the real cost,'cuz the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper?Why are we paying so much for sneakerswhen they're made by little slave kids,what are your overheads?""--Episode 4"
5,Hilarious!,Love these two - such smart comedy! I hope this series sticks around for a very long time!!
5,Hilarious,Super creative and funny. Bret and Jemaine are orignial and entertaining. It is the little things and the randomness that make this show what it is. And how can you not love Mel??
4,It's Business Time,"I was a big fan of Eagle Vs. Shark (A New Zealand Naploeon Dynamite but with smarter writing) So I was thrilled when my friend brought this over to my house to show me a couple of songs from it. I instantly ordered my own copy and have shown it to most of my similarly minded friends who I new would enjoy this kind of humor. It's dry, witty, broad in areas when it needs to be and the music is amazing. The only thing that I found dissapointing was that there was no commentary or special features of any kind. It would have been interesting to see some behind the scenes features or see where they got the idea for some of their songs. Fans of The Office, The IT Crowd and Extras should enjoy this."
5,Funny,"Heard about this series on NPR. Don't have cable so I wait for the DVDs to come out. Very quirky and funny. Love the video lyrics, can't wait for the next season. My teenages daughters loved it as well."
3,NO DVD EXTRAS ???,"While this show is one of the funniest I've seen - it makes me super bummed that this dvd set is devoid of extras. HBO really blew it with this. I had these all on Tivo in Hi-Def and should've kept them there.BUT - the redeeming factor is that, this show is a bit of an underdog - so to purchase it would send a message that we definitely need MORE FOTC. So I bought it anyway."
5,"Don't argue in front of the map, it's wrong!","This show makes me proud to be a kiwi. I can't believe Americans get this show, there are so many jokes i would have thought only New Zealanders would get. Murray, played by Rhys Darby, is the greatest, I'm looking forward to seeing him live this Sunday. I think theres a little Murray in all of us! Cannot wait for series two, the Fotc album and Rhys Darby's film with Jim Carey. As for the DVD, shame there was no extras, but that takes nothing away from this show. Brilliant."
5,Excellent,"Flight of the Conchords is hilarious. Bret and Jemaine are hilarious. Mel, Flight of the Conchords' only fan, is probably my favorite character. But Bret and Jemaine don't have to worry; their US fan base is rapidly growing. Prepare to have their songs stuck in your head at all times."
1,Paid but didn't receive anything...totally not awesome.,"If you enjoy paying for items and not receiving them, check this out for sure."
1,yawn to all hipsters,"may appeal to the hipsters who move into ethnic communities and drive up rents, but this left me bore bored bored. get entourage or the comeback instead."
5,Hilarious,I love the mixture of quirky dialog and funny songs that these guys have managed to pull together. Well worth the money to have this around the house and pop in now and again when we need a good laugh.
5,LOVED IT,The DVD is great....I love Brett and Jemaine and I love Amazon for letting me love Brett and Jemaine. The DVD came quickly and without any hassle or scratches or anything. Thanks Amazon
5,HILARIOUS comedy...,This is hands down one of the funniest series I have ever watched... a must have for any Saturday Night Live fan...
5,Funny and Unique,"This is probably one of the funniest shows to debut in a long time. The combination of off-the-wall, nontraditional humor and musical parodies works very well. This is one of those shows that you and your friends will end up quoting back and forth to one another more than is probably healthy."
5,Fun humor for anyone who liked BBC's The Office more than the US,"A thinking man's comedy for Gen X-ers. The characters are new and fresh and the comedy, and musical routines, will have you laughing. The 2 main characters are from New Zealand and live in New York leading to some humor. Plus they're good-natured but a little dim. Which is also funny. If I had to compare it to something else, I'd say it's 50% Borat + 50% Napoleon Dynamite. And 100% funny."
4,Choice bro!,"The humour is dry and full of wit. Brilliant acting, especially Murray - the long suffering band manager. Each episode is unique and unforgettable. I've been watching the DVD's regularly and continue to find new things to laugh at. Funny bloody songs too! Buy it."
4,Funny,"Flight of the Concords are one of my favorite comedian duos of all time. With simple humor and their pursuit of being famous, these two blend music and comedy quite well. If you don't know who they are, check them out on Youtube before purchasing. They're truly hilarious!They've used about 80% of their music through this first season. I had heard a lot of the songs before buying, so watching the songs blend in with the story of the show was quite amusing."
3,PRETTY TASTY,"I BOUGHT THIS WITHOUT REALIZING THE FLAVORS IT CONTAINED. I WANTED TO RETURN IT, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR SHIPPING. IT TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD."
4,THIS GAME IS THE VERY BEST!,"This is THE MOST ACCURATE fighter simulation I have ever seen. Realistic weapons limitations, hud symiology, ejections, enemy aircraft, graphics, pitch and roll rates, everything. IT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST AND DEFINITLY WORTH THE $12.99!"
5,Best flight sim i've ever played,"This is one of the best flight sims on the market right now even though it's 3 years old and then there's the entrance of Falcon 4.0. I fly F-15 online every day and it's really great. Flight physics are very realistic and the multiplayer support great because of JCN, a chatroom where you can hook up for games. I would recommend it to anybody who likes sims."
4,This game is Fun but comlex,It is sim that is realistic but is getting little dated. But the game is one Janes masterpieces. But to pilots in the real USAF probable experience much more realism. It is good for people who like the more complex Janes F/A-18 and Microproses Falcon 4. This companies does a fair job of support. But the controls of the F-15 are rather compicated. I would like it if you had more support from backseater or WSO. It a good game even thought it wouldn't appeal to Novalogic point and shoot interface.
4,F-15 a good game,"This game is the most realistic jet combat simulator I have ever played. Its graphics are awesome and its views are cool too. You can compete with other players in head-to-head multiplayer battles over the internet, modem,network or serial connections. Design missions and share them with your friends with F-15 powerful mission builder. Maintain optimal situation awarness with a free-panning, 3D virtual cockpit or jump into the back seat an neutralize targets as the weapons system officer. Innovative point and click multi-purpose displays are exact replicas of actual F-15E cockpits. It requires any kind of joistick to be easier to play. I recomend this game to any person who likes aviation or simulation games."
1,Creed does not know how to rock,"I swear, this CD is awful. If I hear With Arms Wide Open one more time, I'm going to pull my hair out. It's bands like this that have great talent but waste it on producing mellow songs with no moral. All the lyrics are exactly the same, and are boring. Scott Stapp has no anger within him, all he is is just a pitiful excuse for a rock singer. He should appear in a Dido CD or something, because all they sing about is happy things. Also, they rruse the same tunes. Beautiful and Say I, placed back to back, is the EXACT same song with different lyrics for each one! Also, they never start off into the ""rock"" immeadiately. They always dawdle with Mark's guitar for about half a minute, then start, but they get lame and downright sorry once the words start up, because the lyrics are all about happy things, and not a member of this band knows how to rock. Forget all about Creed and pop in a good Korn CD...you'll feel better."
1,Well I Just Heard . . .,"This is the worst .... I've ever listened to. The music is unoriginal, and the lyrics are a bunch of sown cliches. Do these guys have something special that I don't see? Not even close to the bands of the grunge movement. Repugnant as the other Korn, Match, and Bizkit heads. Totally uninspired. Check out the album cover . . .whew!"
3,Bring Back the Great Bands,"The first 5 songs on this CD are good, Wrong Way in particular is an excellent song. After this however it is all downhill. Simply put Creed is not an original band, they take the distinct sounds of Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains and try to mold them into one but fail miserably. If you like this type of music then check out the Stone Temple Pilots because they do the same thing but throw in some of their own flavor and make it sound more original. Creed on the other hand can't sustain itself for a full CD doing this and it shows. Never Die is a blatent rip off of AIC and would have been a b-side to that band whereas With Arms Wide Open tries to recreate a Pearl Jam power ballad but just can't pull it off the way that band can. If you think you like this music then check out the grunge bands of the early nineties as they were much better."
2,blah......,"I didn't like this c.d. too much.... just get the single to ""Higher"" or ""With arms wide open""...... the other songs are pretty dumb. ""Beutifull"" is okay......"
1,Garbage,"This is one of the most over rated pieces of trash ever made. Every song almost is terrible and uninspired. Pearl jam sucks hard and this band is like a gay pearl jam. Arms wide open is one of the cheesiest songs ever written, what a pussy band."
4,"""Human Clay"" by Creed is a winner!","If your'e looking for a recording with passion and emotion then ""Human Clay,"" the newest release by Creed is most certainly for you! Once again, Scott Stapp is succesful in lending listeners an ear to his tortured soul, and the band's lyrics will take us to world we have never been to before! The album is filled with dark, Tool-like rhythms, and will take over your mind. The best and most emotional track in my opinion is ""What If?"" But this recording is strictly for the hard-core, no wannabe rock/pop hits here! I give it two thumbs up!"
5,Creed's excellent blend of hard and soft rock does it again!,"Creed is probably one of the most under rated band out there! Creed has not changed their style of music which is probably the best thing about this album. Their excellent blend of Hard and Soft Rock music along with deep and grabbing lyrics are second to none! An excellent album! A worthy sucessor to the multi-platinum ""My Own Prison""."
2,Overrated,"Creed never really has much appealed to me. Scott Stapp's voice is good, but boring. All the songs on this are also boring and WAY to soft. The only really good song is ""What If"" and ""Higher""'s OK, but nothing special. Personally, I don't see what all the hype is about them. Well, anyway, if you want some good Christian rock, get POD's ""Satellite"". That's all."
5,Creed keeps on rocking,"Human Clay is one of the best records of 1999. The first single, Higher, proves the musical talents of the musicians. The guitar riffs are au natural, no special effects. I am loving the bass licks and little solos here and there. What If and Higher show off Scott Stapp's amazing vocal talents. i would give this album 10 stars if I could. Buy it and tell your friends to buy it."
1,Creed is horrible,"If there were an award for the most pretentious piece of trash on CD, Creed's Human Clay would win top honors. I bought this CD, and i couldnt even get through it one time. I sold it on ebay. I felt like I was being preached to on religion through a web of extremely poorly executed rock. Their sound is indistinctive and there are better alternatives that have a cleaner sound and that dont have religious undertones such as Lifehouse or Pearl Jam. I cant wait until Creed falls into the annals of Bad Rock."
2,the flaws of our world.,"to all of you who like creed:wake up. i know where you are. i was there in sixth grade, you are feeling angsty and maybe hear a catchy song on the radio, with words in it like 'pain' and 'higher' and you think, whoa deep. if you are still reading and you still like creed you may discredit my opinion now, but this is part of what is wrong with our world today, that art is hidden behind the wall of fake-art, and the wall of fake-art is all that many can see. do yourself a favor and dig yourself out of this hole of mediocre music. There is so much better stuff you can enrich your mind with. if you keep listening to this you will regret it in a couple years."
5,Arms wide Open,"This song was very inspiring and bought me and my bf together after learning we are expecting our first baby. It's his first baby and the stance in the song which reads ""Well I don't know if i'm ready, to be the man I have to be.."" really sinks in and makes sense. Cause you don't have at act like you're ready, many of our are not, the song tells us it's ok to be real, and not be 100%"
4,"CREED-Good album, but not as great as ""My Own Prison""","I love Creed. I've liked them since they came out in '97. I was kinda anticipating buying this because I didn't like what they played on the radio, BUT after seeing them L-I-V-E, I definitley had to get this album! If you are not sure of this album, I'd recommend seeing them in concert first, be it on video or at a live show. It will make you appreciate how good this album really is. But it's still not as good as ""My Own Prison,"" but good nonetheless."
2,Similar to their First Album,"There seems to be some controversy over whether ""Human Clay"" is better than Creed's first album, ""My Own Prison"", with the majority view being that the first album employed less sophisticated production techniques.Nonetheless, the difference between the two seems minimal to me. If you like pounding guitars and vocals that sound like Pearl Jam, you'll probably like this again. In particular, ""Faceless Man"" is a reasonably good song.For what it's worth, I liked the first album marginally better, and wish I'd saved my money."
3,In Response,"In Response to Mark Delaney: If you are seriously looking into buying this CD, I would. It is a great addition to any collector's libray. Although I have to agree with one of Mark's points about Creed, in that, they tend to use the same guitar riffs over and over, but, the moving lyrics make up for it quite well. The lyrics are hardly ""cheesy"" and have a Christian influence, which is even better. The riff in 'Higher' is hardly annoying, but I guess that depends on the person. I guess our friend Mark is more of the 'pure' grunge rock personality, such as Perl Jam or Alice in Chains. Over all Creed is a great buy and the entire CD is worth listening to. That's not something I can say for the latest Pearl Jam. Creed Rocks! :-)"
3,Not Bad,"This CD is not that bad, I think that they did a better job at their last album. It's just that the songs in this album is so similar, and that makes the songs very boring to hear more than once. If I had to grade this album, I would give it a 6 out of 10, because its not that good. I know that creed is overall a good band, but they can do a better job. This album is not that bad, but it is just not my kind of music."
2,Creed's sold out.,"Creed's first album, My Own Prison, was a smash rock album. They brought a sound that hadn't been heard for years. With this second album, they've sold out. They changed their sound in order to get airplay (overplay) and you just get so sick of them and Stapp's ""blessed"" attitude. What happened to their rock sound. They've gone commercial and they're just another pop band now, unfortunately."
4,"""We'll surely melt in the rain . . .""","I know that the band Creed sounds a lot like Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots, but it still made some good music in the 1990's. The album ""Human Clay"" is just as good as ""Core"" and ""Vitalogy"". Songs like ""What if"" and ""Say I"" can be best described as awe-inspiring, with heavy and melodic guitar riffs throughout. ""Faceless Man"" is lyrical, and is my favorite song in the album. The singles ""With Arms Wide Open"" and ""Higher"" sadly don't do justice when compared to the other songs. I don't know why; they just sound so sappy. ""Never Die"" and ""Wash Away Those Years"" sound terrible; the melodies are flat-out irritating. Finally, the closer called ""Inside Us All"" makes for a perfect ending to this album.Despite its flaws, it's still a good album. And Creed is a good band; just not as good as Pearl Jam & Stone Temple Pilots.Grade: B+"
4,Creed Hidden message underneather,"well Although alot of people are dissapointed with this album i still will listen to it, maybe i just can put up with music or maybe some people dont know good music, but either way, i think creed is awesome, not only do they play awesome music on every cd they put out, they have christian refrences in them, and how many bands can put out music liek that and have hit songs... not many, besides that they are hard rock band that had the potential to do somthing but held back... thats what i think anyways, and about the cd i think its pretty good, its slower then their first cd and way harder, which makes it cool because not one of their cds is the same, their newest one and last for them was the best, it was a mix between hard rock and fast pased beat, the lyrics on the other hand were a bit not as ""serious"" or more to the point some could say, anyways i give this cd 7/10 (average) because its nothing bad but nothing extreme~"
1,Over done,"Granted, Strap should be excited about his child, and a song for him (or her) is a splendid idea. However, it should be a simple accoustic song, hidden at the end of the tracks. There is no need to craft an absurd opus, particularly when you have limited vocal range. Perhaps that is why he chose a violin laden song for ""With Arms Wide Open"", because he does not have the vocal talent to carry an accoustic song.By the way, could someone explain to me the line, ""I lie beneath the tree of wisdom/ Your ax is cut and would you be there???(What If)"
1,Mediocre at best...,"Their first album was far more tollerable for one simple reason: it was new. Human Clay is what I call ""recycled music"". Why? Simple. Creed's new cd offers nothing new and basically stuffs old riffs back into songs with new lyrics. So that's why I loath this this album."
5,Creed Has Talent That I Didn't Fully Recognize At First,"Now that I heard this album a few times over, I must change my former opinion about this band. This band is AS GOOD AS Days Of The New, Megadeth, and other bands that I like. But, it isn't as good as Queensryche; no band is as good as Queensryche. I am really enjoying 'Human Clay' more and more each time I listen to it. Now, I feel that 'Human Clay' is definitely better, much better, than 'My Own Prison'. Also, an excellent song which I forgot to mention in my previous review is ""Beautiful""; that song has been playing in my head all day today and I don't think it'll stop anytime soon. However, ""Say I"" is still my favorite song on the CD; that song is all powerful. If you buy this album for just 1 song, it would be for ""Say I"", the song is killer. If you liked 'My Own Prison', GET THIS ALBUM! You'll like this album even more, maybe even a whole lot more."
4,Good...but not quite as good,"I don't quite like this CD as much as ""My Own Prison"" there debut album. However if you liked there debut album you will also like this one. They are very similar...Creed has carved out it's own unique sound and it's a good one. For some reason there 1st album seemed to have something that this one lacks...I can't put my finger on what exactly that is..but it doesn't hit me as hard as ""My Own Prison""...at any rate if you liked there debut you'll like this one as well!"
2,This is a really bland CD,"I like simplicit rock as much as the next guy, but c'mon this CD is flat out boring. Just about every song starts the same, they use some spacey guitar riff, then rock out. Their first CD was good listened to sparingly, and this one is just more of the same. In interviews I've heard them say that the first album was just a demo. I'd say if that's true, this album is an over-produced/effected demo."
5,"This CD is incredible, both musically and lyrically","I love this CD! I never thought Creed could put out an album that could even compare to My Own Prison, but they definitely did. The lyrics on Human Clay are amazing and as thought provoking as the ones on My Own Prison. Creed's music talent has definitely matured also. Human Clay is definitely another classic."
5,I'd Give 10 Stars if I Could,"Creed's second CD is awesome! It easily lives up to the standards set by My Own Prison. The highlights of this CD are ""Higher"", ""What If"", ""With Arms Wide Open"", ""Faceless Man"" and ""Are You Ready"" but all of the songs are excellent. This CD is a must for any music lover, just like their first one still is."
4,creed- only improved,"While shopping online, I came across this CD and wondered, ""What's the difference between this one and the regular 'Human Clay' CD?"" Well, a good bit.For example, the clarity on this CD is a lot better than the original and there is one surprise: a bonus track called ""Young Grow Old"", an absolutely awesome offering from Creed.However, there isn't much else original about the CD- and that's fine. The original ""Human Clay"" CD is here, with its showcase offerings like ""With Arms Wide Open"", ""Higher"", and ""What If"", and nothing is missing that made ""Human Clay"" great. Still, there's just something missing that prevents me from giving it the full 5 stars. Also, the second CD contains acoustic versions of ""What's This Life For"" and ""With Arms Wide Open"", plus three other songs.Overall rating: classic Creed, with a brand new single- what more can you ask for? 4.5 stars"
1,"Still hate it, sorry","I don't get it. I've tried so hard to enjoy this CD, but I just can't ever like it. The melodies are uninteresting, the vocalist sounds like a bad Eddie Vedder, and the musicians as a whole aren't particularly good.Sure they have a positive message. So? Kenny G has a positive message, does that make him worthwhile?I understand many people like, even love, this album. But I can't understand it. I always feel like something is just lacking from all of the songs - soul. This is just too bland for me."
5,GET THIS ONE ASAP!!!,"Are you afraid that ""HIGHER"" may be the only track you'll like and are hesitant about buying the C.D.? OH MY GOD! out of all the tracks you will listen to atleast 8 of them over and over.Starting with ""WASH AWAY THOSE YEARS"" , ""BEAUTIFUL"", ""WHAT IF"" ""ARMS WIDE OPEN"" HIGHER is just the beginning of this great music experience. I am fortunate to be seeing CREED in concert Oct.4th in Houston, wish I could take you with me... Please get this one......"
5,Best ablum ever by the best band ever!,This is the best band ever! I love it I saw them live and they ROCK! This ablum has ASOME lryics! so powerful and means so much to me.
4,good,"some good songs but not a very original sound, if you like this then you should get some alice in chains, pearl jam, or soundgardan, which by the way are the bands that creed trys to sound like."
1,How does a sane man like this band?,"I loved early 90s grunge rock. I listen to my cds on a regular basis, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, even some of the more obscure bands like Mudhoney i've gotten into. This band just wants to be like Pearl Jam and all of the early 90s grunge bands only they dont have the talent to do it. The band is terribly subpar including Mark Tremonti who is the most overrated guitarist ever. Scott Stapp is the worst singer/songwriter i've ever heard and i have a voodoo doll that i use to put various curses on him so this band will never make another record.Go buy some early 90s grunge, Alice In Chains-s/t says Jared, go get that. Creed ...."
5,Rockin Album from Creed!,"Great album from Creed. After the first single hit the airways I knew this album would be a hit. I think ""Higher"" is better than some music on, My Own Prison!"
5,I thought they couldn't top My Own Prison...,"And I was wrong. Oh boy, was I wrong. Every song -- not just a majority of the songs, but every song -- on this album is simply incredible. Scott Stapp has an amazing voice, able to give songs like What If and Beautiful a powerful tone, while giving With Arms Wide Open an uplifting one. If you've only heard their single Higher and liked it, then you're in for a treat when you purchase this CD. Higher isn't a one-hit wonder stunt like so many other bands pull on their albums. What If, Beautiful, and With Arms Wide Open contend with it for the best track on this album, in my opinion. Kudos to Creed for not disappointing."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Creed, does it again. I just got the cd today from amazon, and I am going onto listening to it for the 5th time now. Its just as good as the first album if not better. What's amazing about this band is what their songs are about. Most people don't know that Creed is a christian band, and the song 'higher' is a perfect showing of that. A great message and a killer sound. I'd give this cd 10 stars if I could."
4,Creed on the rise,I own my prison as well as human clay. I love them both. Human Clay is a little diffent then there first album. But that is good. I like the fact that they did not try to remake there first album so to speak. They really took it to a new level with human clay!
3,Pretty darn good.,"This album was a little hard to take the first time through, but playing it a second and third time made it more appealing. For Metal and Hard Rock fan's, its a great addtion to your collection."
5,Nothing Compares To It,"I am one of Creed's biggest fans and I have been even before Human Clay and I think it is better than My Own Prison. MOP was my favorite CD before Human Clay so take my word for it, it is a must have."
2,"Shape us (like clay), but not make us...","Take me higher - what an awesome number! But the rest of this CD degenerates into a third-rate Pearl jam thing that I was ashamed to listen to. The passion is just not there with these guys...and MTV sweat does not count!I must admit I was excited at the fact that ALT music was not dying with so many bands 'popping' on to the scene after Pearl Jam had a 'break' and Soundgarden just called it a day - but CREED is not the answer to the alt or any fan's rock today (unless you like bury your head!). This CD is pretty cool, however there is a LOT of great music out there that is just as good that does not have the corporate endorsement that CREED has...(or maybe HAD)."
5,"food for the soul, with catchy licks","This is the only band that I feel has met the standards set by the first album. This album will send chills through your spine. The metal is well put together, and gives power to the lyrics, which will hit home for anyone. If anyone thinks that the lyrics don't mean a thing, listen to them again."
3,"Carrying the dim flame of the ""grunge"" torch","I am familiar with the ""New Pearl Jam"" tag being applied to Creed, but I think Stone Temple Pilots and Alice In Chains are more accurate references. Creed's singer tries to sound a lot like Scott Weiland and the guitarist tends to crank out grinding riffs aplenty a la Jerry Cantrell. Now, if you are part of the more cynical musical set, you will look down on Creed for trying to carry the grunge torch into the next millenium. But, if you have a sweet spot for catchy faux-anthemic tunes, then Creed is your bag. Human Clay is not Nevermind or Vs., but it is decent grunge ear candy. Maybe not Nirvana Mk. II, but a whole hell of a lot better than Candlebox or Collective Soul."
5,Amazing,"This cd is just amazing... Creed really made some good music with these added tracks.. It's so good it's almost like a 3rd cd for them.. I recommecd this cd to everyone who loves creed. I own the normal Human Clay and bought this anyways, it's great..P.S. Wind-up records has released the date for creeds upcoming cd. Creed's third cs will be released in stores Novemeber 20, 2001.. The band will go in the studio early July to begin recording"
2,First cd I ever bought...,"...And I can't say it's my best. ""Wrong way"" and ""Never Die"" are great songs, but as a whole, this album comes off a little weak. ""My own prison"" is a better cd."
2,To be honest...,"...this is a far stretch from being as good as the first! ""Higher"" and ""Arms Wide Open"" as well as ""Faceless Man"" are truly great songs, but aside from them, this album is blah. They just try too hard or not enough here. Sorry guys, you're a potentially great band, but great bands are consistent. This record is not. Don't buy it, buy the singles."
5,Legendary,"Wow.Creed has been my number 2 band for a long while now.Not since Collective Soul has a band touched me with it's honest and uplifting lyrics and a good helping of real hard rock.Songs like Higher and With Arms Wide Open are modern day classics and Faceless Man is a song you can dream to.All the songs are good and albums like that are hard to find.This sequel surpassed expectations,and should shut the critics up once and for all.Bravokadu81@hotmail.com"
4,AWESOME,"I am a huge fan of music and will basically listen to everything, but this CD surpases them all. The reason I picked up this CD was because I heard With Arms Wide Open and Higher on the radio and loved them. After I listened to the whole CD I was impressed by the sheer talent of the group. They have an amazing talent to really reach out to you in their songs. This CD is really worth buying!"
5,Creed Rocks and they send deep and soulful of messages,"I got Human Clay 3 weeks ago and I loved it. Cool sounds, Rock hard, and meaningful messages what a perfect combination. And because of that I bought their MOP 2 days ago and I loved it also."
5,AWESOME CD!!!! POSITIVE AND CLEAN!!!,"When I first heard 'Higher', I had to buy the CD! I just got it and I think it is AWESOME!!! The songs are very heavy and they are catchy! This is a very positive and clean album also."
1,GARBAGE,"First off Creed is garbage. Their music is garbage and his lyrics are garbage. You want some real lyrics, listen to some EMO-CORE. This is a perfect cd for hanging out at the monster truck rally and comparing the utter coolness of your MULLET cut. Great music for small town heroes with tight rolled jeans and camaros. Get a clue. Creed is junk."
2,Over rated and over produced.,"I first got into Creed when they first Realeased My own Prison and like everyone else I thought they were great. I liked the album but the more I listened to it, the more I didn't like it!I then got their second album and again I was blown away by them and thought they were great......and then the same thing happend. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good album and it sounds good but it just seems to have something missing. The lyrics go from bad to worse, which for me, brings the whole album down. Scott Stapp is a good frontman and has a good, if unremarkable voice but as a lyricist I find him very poor. All the songs all seem like overwrought ballads or rock songs and seem to go on far longer than they should and it seemed vastly overproduced.If you like Creed or are a fan of the first album then go ahead and buy this one, you'll probably love it. If not, don't. It just doesn't seem worth it."
2,Typical.,Even somewhat great writing compared to today's pitiful manufactured pop world can't lift this album from catchy to good. Innovation is not in Creed's vocabulary.
1,creed,creed's my own prison was a good albumn but this is one of the worst that i have ever heard. Higher was over played on every on radio station in my town. it is still being played and this song has been out for over a year. please people don't buy this creed albumn buy my own prison it is 5 times better.
2,The Music is not original,"First of all I am not a Creed hater but a music fan, I listened to there cd and felt it was very inspiring and obvious that he was influenced from a higher calling. I think the music is un-original, you cant honestly say that after listening to the cd that you have not heard that type of music voice. I suppose the only thing i did like about it was that it was positive and easy to listen to without the annoying explitives in the music because that tends to get old. Im sure after listening to the cd you can comprise a list of music bands that make Creed out to be a carbon copy of those bands (ie: Pearl Jam, STP, etc.)"
5,Music to cry and laugh to,"This CD almost makes me proud to be a devoted Christian. This cd excells far beyond their debut album. Powerful lyrics and sheer talent all make this CD unforgettable. Now for the Inevitable ""name all the tracks I like"". I like the tracks, arms wide open, higher, and what if. Notice that all those tracks happen to be played NONSTOP on the radio. You'll also notice that i'm a media junkie and a total conformist."
3,"Nice CD ,but still some things that Creed lacks","This was an overall pretty good Cd ,but the band does not have the power of the guitar and a good enough voice to ever be were Limp Bizkit is right now. I think that the vocalist Scott Stapp, has some work to do on his voice. His vioce is way to low and it is hard to understand him. The guitarists have some work to do getting more bass into their music. So, There you have it they are an overall band of three stars and have some work to do."
3,Not Bad but not so good,I eagerly waited this albums release and must say I'm none to pleased. If you like the softer stuff then you'll like this album but if the harder stuff is what you look for then it's a miss. The first two tracks rock but it's lack luster after that.
2,Mediocrity at it's best,"This album is a disapointment to me.""Higher""is a fine song, with it's good singing and catchy/burly guitar riffs.""With arms wide open""is sweet(The strings version is even better).Those songs are worth the purchase of this Cd.How ever things go down hill after that.Some of the other songs are okay& some are just terrible.Think monotonous,bland,simplistic,sluggish& predictable.The lead singer has a good voice, but is monotonous. There's no blazing Pearl Jam-like guitars,crafty guitar work/rythyms of Alice In Chains, sharp/powerful tempo changes like Live and it just doesn't rock out like a Stone Temple Pilots Cd. I know the comparison will upset some people, but I would much-rather reach for and crank up something like that. As popular as this Cd is I expected it to be real good, despite a couple bright spots it just isn't."
3,not the best....,"I have definalty heard better songs than these. The music gets old Very fast. The songs are cool the first 5 times you hear them. I f you want a good cd, get Return of Saturn, No Doubt; Writings on the wall, Destiny's Child' or Unrestricted, Da Brat"
5,This CD is off the chain!!,"I have been a Creed fan for a long while but I just got the CD. I love there music so much! You can not help but feel their songs. My favorite on the CD is track 9 ""Higher"". Now that song is one for the record books, it is that good. Now do not get me wrong the whole CD is good. Some other songs I like on this album are tracks 1,3,8, and 11. This is a definite must buy!"
5,The Power.,"This is an album about Power. Not only spiritual power, as has been addressed by other reviewers, but the power of us as humans. We have the power to make this world what we want. Creed powerfully suggests we use that power to make the world better. How can anyone disagree?This album is a hard rock presentation of that message. The incredible bass underlying ""Higher"" accentuates the question being asked - are we strong enough to use the power we have - while intimating that yes, indeed, we are strong enough, if we only try. The amazing ""With Arms Wide Open"" imposes a parental responsibility to not only exercise our own power for our children's benefit, but to further instill that power in our children, and to try to make our children's power greater than our own.The power of the message and the power of the music both on one disc. How can anyone disagree?"
5,It's grunge/metal still alive.,"I don't care what the other reviews say, Creed is a great band. People just complain too much, since they're narrow minded and have nothing better to do.To me and a lot of other people I know Creed is distinctive, with vocals that get your attention and driving guitars. If you you like a great produced cd, filled with talent pick this one up."
3,Not bad...,"These guys will probably go down as one of the best rock bands of the early 00's. This album along with their other one sold alot of copies, and they did have alot of hits. Their music isn't amazing, but I think their way better than those Nickelcrack and 3 D***s Down wannabes will ever be."
5,the best rock in years,"first lets get the comparisons of pearl jam out of the way. i have been a pearl jam fan from the very begining, and still continue to follow the band. i feel the only comparison between these two bands is the fact that EDDIE VEDDER and Scott Stapp sound a similar. their music and creative talents are totally different. pearl jam maybe an influence , but creed is it's on band. my own prison was a refreshing return for rock considering all this rock/metal/rap crap coming about nowadays. human clay is just another huge step for creed and rock because the album is truly unbelieveable and still has no comparisons to pearl jam. if you do not enjoy this album it's because you are not a true rock fan and you do not like to think because stapp's creative talents make you think about life and that to me is awesome when someone can make you think and feel better about your life. so pick this album up if you relly want to go higher."
4,Excellent Buy: Well Worth The Price Tag,"I just got this CD and I'm very impressed (and hooked). Yeah I'm a bit late buying it, but I'm one that likes to wait and see how it sells and how good it really is. Anyway, this album really is worth the price tag. The lyrics are deep and the vocals are nothing short of awesome. ""Are You Ready?"", ""What If"", ""Faceless Man"", ""With Arms Wide Open"", and ""Higher"" are the best songs on the album in my opinion. It's hard these days to find an album with this many good solid songs: definitely worth the cash.This CD is great proof that you don't need to cuss every other word to produce a great album. Some of you may not agree with that comment, but it's true. Anyway, this is a great CD that many of you may want to check out (if you haven't already)."
4,Great CD,"I think ""Human Clay"" is better than their previous album. I really enjoy it. I got it as a gift over a year ago, when only ""Higher"" was out. I immediately liked ""With Arms Wide Open."" I would say that this is one of the better discs in my collection."
1,It's All Been Done,"Unfortunately for Creed's musical maturity...they won't experience it.A far better version of this album exists...it is called Ten, and it is by a humble little seattle quintet known as Pearl Jam...The problems with this release are numerous. The catchy guitar hooks and repetitive choruses serve to irritate true fans of grunge. Stapp's voice was pleasant on My Own Prison; he had a rich baritone, which has since become hoarse and grating as he valiantly attempts to imitate Eddie Vedder. With Arms Wide Open is a blatant rip-off of PJ's Release, but what makes the rip-off all the more sad is that, while Release was a spontaneous jam session by the PJ boys, Stapp et. al. had to really sit down and THINK about their song before they ""created"" it. And of course, lacking Mike McCready's spontaneous giutar noodling, this album's gitars sound engineered, at best. My advice? Go buy Pearl Jam, STP, and Alice In Chains."
1,what's all the fuss about?,"I felt compelled to listen to this cd after being given the advice that, ""If you like Buckcherry, you will definitely like 'Human Clay'"", and after hearing such good things about the band. But to be brutally honest, I was extremely disappointed. The lyrics were tired, and overused, and the rhythmn sounded just the same as every other wannabe rock band. However, there is one redeeming feature to this cd (hence the 1 star rating), that is very important to remember: IT IS NOT BRITNEY SPEARS! And for that alone, I will thank Creed."
5,Creed-Human Clay rocks.,"I love this cd. Before I bought the cd, I had only heard ""What If"" and ""Higher"" on the radio but I have listened to the cd all the way through several times and I like the other songs better every time I hear them. All of the songs are unique in their own way which in turn makes the cd very versatile. Hence, there is a song for everyone. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes rock music."
3,"It's alright, but not what I expected.","I heard the song ""Higher"" and couldn''t wait to pick this CD up. I bought it on the day it came out, in fact. When I got it, it was way different than what I had expected. The songs tend to drone together as one big groan-fest. Higher is definitely the best on the CD. I'd rather but the single, if I were you."
3,What happened to old Creed??,I thought is was alright but no where near as good as the first one. I only liked one song which was Higher. I think that if you like the band you should buy this CD.
3,"This is good, but not anywhere as good as ""My Own Prison!""","""Human Clay"" was a requested christmas gift from my mom. Maybe I should not have asked for it. It's OK, but sorry guys ""What If"" really works on my nerves! I do like ""Higher"" and ""Arms Wide Open,"" but most of the songs don't sound like the original Creed. It's a shame! CREED is coming to my hometown in May for a concert and I can hardly wait! I may have to wear my earplugs through the HUMAN CLAY songs!"
3,Two good songs,"""With Arms Wide Open"" and ""Higher"". Those are two great songs. The rest of the album though, nothing special. I'm not a real big rock fan, so that's probably the main reason I don't like this cd that much. I would reccomend buying this just because of the two songs I mentioned, but don't expect much else from any other song on here. Also, even though I'm sure hard-core Creed fans will disagree with this, I think that Creed sounds a lot like bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Sound Garden,etc."
2,A Big Disappointment,"There tends to be a correlation between bands becoming extremely popular and the quality of their music. This, unfortunately, held true for Creed.The most obvious problem with the CD is that all of the songs sound the same, unlike My Own Prison, which had a variety of styles.Basically, if you were a die-hard fan of My Own Prison, I don't think that you would find Human Clay to be a worthy purchase."
1,Why is Creed great?,Why is Creed is considerd a great band? They got there sound from great bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. The only problem is Creed is not nearly as talented as Pearl Jam or Soundgarden. But yet they make comments that there a better band then Pearl Jam and that Eddie Vedder could not write lyrics as good as Scott Stapp. yea right. Lets see were Creed is 5 years from now.
1,"Creed's a horrible, horrible band...","I'm sorry, but everytime i hear Creed, I have to shudder. No, I'm not a harcore punk, and I don't listen to oldies all day. But Creed is the most unoriginal band I have ever heard. Find some music with actual emotion."
1,what?,my friend has this cd and he loves it well he had it on in his room one day and i was like what the heck is this? its the same stuff u hear at church (nothin` agianst god) but if u want to hear this cd go 2 church its just about the same stuff! sure 1 of the popular songs might make u want to buy this cd but dont waste your money for this! (i gave it 1 star cuz theres no option for 0!!)
1,Ouch,"At first I thought this CD might be good, but once I heard it, it turned out to be horrible. This CD Sounds exactly like practically very other band out there, and is nothing new at all."
2,More Of The Same,"If you liked Creed's old album, My Own Prison, then you'll love this one. If not, then don't waste your money. This has 11 new songs that all sound the same. Unless you're a die-hard Creed fan, it's not worth it."
1,Thank God (or someone),"It's a small but welcome victory for honest music that these corporate Pearl Jam-wannabe poseurs broke up.One down -- about 1,852 to go."
1,A TRULY TERRIBLE ALBUM,"I had high expectations of this album after listening to their debut album, MOP. However, this CD was truly terrible. There is NO musicality and the songs are hard to listen to. The only song on here that is somewhat decent is ""higher"". if you like that song, just get the single and do not waste your money on this crappy CD."
3,Pretty decent...,"I don't understand why people keep saying Creed were a Pearl Jam ripoff band. These plagiarism accusations are entirely unfounded. It was the late 1990s people! It was only a few years after Pearl Jam's heyday, and it was only natural that new bands coming out in the late nineties would sound similar to one of the most popular bands of the earlier part of the decade. Whenever a band like Pearl Jam becomes popular, they influence up and coming artists. There's nothing wrong with that!The truth is, Pearl Jam and Creed are similar bands, but that does not make Creed a ripoff band. They are just two 1990s alternative rock bands that play similar styles of music. As long as the lyrics are not word for word, as long as the riffs aren't note for note, you can't seriously claim that Creed copies another band! But don't just take my word for it; look it up! As far as I know, there is no law against sounding vaguely similar to another recording artist! You can't copyright a musical genre!"
2,"'Higher' is a good song, but the rest is weak","I bought this CD, like most people, because of the song 'Higher' which is a great tune. the rest of the CD is mediocre at best with alot of attempts to continue with the Soundgarden and Pearl Jam traditions. the singer sounds too much like Eddie Vedder, which gets annoying after a while. if you like some of Creed's songs, listen to them on the radio and save your money for a Soundgarden CD...i would also recommend Filter, a Chicago band, who are much better than Creed and a bit more original."
1,Sucks.,Creed were horrible. Let us rejoice in the fact that they had mental breakdowns and broke up.
1,garbage that the US shamefully has to import,"1 bonus track = added garbage in an era of bad music. To claim this is rock music is a shame on rock itself. This is pop. It's sad that this in a import to countries where music still has integrity and taste. Radiohead, U2, Led Zeppelin, Stone Temple Pilots, Travis, Oasis. This is what rock is about. Creed misses on all accounts with formulaic, repetive melodies of safe commerical pop with rehashed lite-metal riffs straight from the stolen bin. The US is gullible, but I didn't think it would come this far...."
1,CHRISTAIN ROCK!,"Who the hell needs to listen to some ugly guy sing about going higher (heaven?) or ""With Arms Wide Open"". Can't you tell, even by the band's name that they're Christain?! CREED! I would give it zero stars but there was no choice. For awesome rock, check out Dave Matthews' Band, or U2, or Third Eye Blind..."
1,try the real thing,"if you like creed and think you like ""hard rock"", listen to the bands that creed poorly imitates, like the amazon.com reviewer said: soundgarden, alice, as well as corrosion of conformity, helmet, king's x, even earlier metallica, not this slick, commercial, juvenile ""music""."
1,Human Stink,buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve.
1,Boring 11-track album!,"Thank God it's only 11 tracks long! I don't see how so many people can like Creed. Personally, I think they're one giant bore. Their songs are soooo long and they keep on repeating the same things over, and over, and over, and over, and...well, you get the point. (Kinda like the Engergiser Bunny, huh?!) Their songs ""Higher"" and ""With Arms Wide Open"" are overplayed on the radio and because of that, they got very annoying. You can't even understand half of what they are saying because the hard-core music drowns out their voices. Creed is just as boring and stupid as 'N SYNC. Hmmmm...does Creed and 'N SYNC run in the same category? Looks that way! Both are annoying, boring, and just plain stupid. Don't buy this album; it's a total waste of money and your time. Buy an album that's top-quality and by a band or artist with REAL talent!"
1,QUIT PREACHIN,"THESE GUYS ARE ""CHRISTIAN ROCK"". THEY ARE PREACHING TO EVERYONE AND TELLING THEM THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY CORRECT ANSWER TO LIFE. WELL TO YOU BOYS IN CREED WERE EVER TO READ THIS, I HAVE MY OWN LITTLE GOSPLE FOR YOU. choices always were a problem for you, what you need is someone strong to guide you. they've been blinded dumb and were born to follow what you need is someone stong to guide you. like me. he has needs. like i do. we both want, to r a p e you. props to rev. maynard on that one."
1,buy johnny cash instead,dont immediately dismiss country music. johnny cash provides intense and emotional songs that are timeless.
1,STP copy,"What If. That's a song title on this record, and it's also a question i wanna ask..... What if Creed didn't copy Stone Temple Pilots and Soundgarden that much? that's a question they should ask themselves. Then it wouldn't be much of a record would it. Give me a break man, we've heard this a thousand times............."
2,Today's Music,"I recently heard a commentary that Rock and Roll was back and that Creed was leading the resurgance. Consequently I bought Human Clay based on the buzz and hearing a few cuts on the radio. I also bought a classic, Springsteen's Born to Run. Played back to back, I can only say that if Creed is today's Rock and Roll, I'll take the classics like Springsteen any time. Creed is so dreary and lacking in excitement, I could barely play the whole disk. I kept hoping for some change in tempo or tone as cut by cut went by. It didn't happen. Human Clay's next playing will be in the CD exchange, I should be able to pick up a few classics for it."
3,This is an overrated cd,"Creed's ""Human Clay"" is an ok cd. I liked some of the songs but the cd is certainly nothing to get exited about. It is true. Creed sounds like bad pearl jam. There is NO WAY people can compare Mr. Scott Stapp with Eddie Vedder. Pearl Jam are ten times better musicians than Creed is. some idiot said here that Scott stapp sings his lyrics with more heart and soul that Eddie Vedder does. I hope he is joking! Eddie Vedder is the king when it comes to express emotions and feelings in his songs. (listen to black!) Eddie is exceptional on what he does! Scott is so far just a mimic. Hope Creed can build up some more potential in their next release. They sound good and play hard. We will soon see.."
1,BUYER BEWARE: Christain band trying to be Pearl Jam,"I made the most unfortunate mistake of purchasing this bands first album. There is VERY little originality in any of this band's compositions. They go to great lengths to rip off Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and other grunge act's sound. To make matters even worse, they try to convey their right-wing religious convictions in nearly every song. Their lead singer trys really hard to pull off an Eddie Vedder imitation. Unless you're into so called ""Christian Rock"" I would stay away from this band and all their albums."
2,I've heard worse.,"But only from boy-bands.Creed's overwrought, awkward, poorly crafted lyrics and uninspired melodies are in full force on this album. Slickly processed, commercialized garbage is still garbage, folks.Sure, they're popular. So are American cheese, backyard wrestling, and heroin. The fact that they're popular doesn't mean they have any intrinsic value."
2,At least they're consistant....,"Ah Creed. To think that when I heard their first album I thought they had potential. They might have, but that all ended with Human Clay. I owned this cd for a little while, and I must admit, sometimes I really enjoyed listening to it. However, one thing stuck out to me like nothing else - all the songs are the EXACT same. They're the same tempo (I swear they used a metronome on the same tempo for the whole dang cd), the same structure, and the list goes on. It gets to the point where you might as well put one track from the album on repeat and you're not missing anything. Amazon chose an excellent word: redundant. Seriously, there are SO many other, better bands out there if people would just make the effort to find them. Unfortunately, that would require effort, and heaven forbid we do anything on our own. I'll get off my soapbox now, but hopefully this was helpful to anyone who was thinking of wasting away precious money on this."
2,Human Clay? try Human WASTE.,"""Never Die"", ""With Arms Wide Open"" and ""Higher"" are the ONLY good songs on this CD. I can't imagine owning this CD and was glad that I only borrowed it from my cousin. Ugh! Terrible!"
5,OH MY GOSH!,"This CD is amazing, absoulty amazing, great songs and great music. Every song is a good one. This CD is no where near bad and dosen't get old. I would recomend it to anyone."
2,gets old quickly,"I got this album soon after it first came out. It was interesting for a while. However, after a while the music just got bland. It seem that the band really did not put all to much into the album. My own prison was good because Strapp put a lot of heartfelt emotion into the album but Human Clay shows how success can spoil a band. Stick with my own prison."
3,human clay,"I really liked the song ""With Arms Wide Open"" so I decided to purchase the human clay album. After listening to the album I realized that this was the only song from creed in which I liked. Everything else on the album tended to sound the same or not really intrest me. I guess I just have a different preference when it comes to music. Although, I'm not saying this is a bad album it just took me by suprise when i realized how heavy the rest of there music is. I don't regret buying the cd but, simply would suggest sampling it before purchasing."
3,Good but not great,"A little disappointing after the great ""Human Clay"" in 1997. ""Higher"" and ""With Arms Wide Open"" are great and originial. Then there's the other nine songs --- they all sound the same. They're even all in the same key!! That doesn't mean the general style is bad -- it would be good if they had done 2 or 3 songs like that rather than the entire album except the singles. ""Are You Ready"" sounds way too much like Stone Temple Pilots' ""Vasoline."" ""What If?"" and ""Beautiful"" are nearly identical. What happened? My Own Prison was full of different-sounding songs that were almost all great. Hopefully Weathered will go back to the My Own Prison style."
3,CREEDence Revival,"Human Clay became the better-selling album of Creed's two releases (1997's My Own Prison being the other) by selling over 9 millions copies opposed to the 3 million units moved by their debut. In turn, the album also garnered Creed massive radio airplay with the massive hits ""Higher"" and ""With Arms Wide Open"". However, this latest effort pales slightly in comparrision to My Own Prison. It lacks the free-flowing and brutally honest songs that can be found on their prior LP. However, there is certainly nothing WRONG with this album. In fact, it's one of the better rock albums of '99."
5,This CD Rocks...,This is the best CREED Album they have ever came out with...The tracks are cool and they rock!So Get It!
2,I WAS DISSAPOINTED...,"this album was very dissapointing... i bought it think it was gonna be as good as the first... i was VERY wrong. this album was below scum.i didn't even get past thie 5th song... there is only 1 good song... ""what if"". i will be forever mad at myself for buy this ""less than an album""......... trust me.. it stinks!"
3,"Maturity Musically, but still just as one dimentional as MoP","Human Clay is a well done sophomore effort by Creed but it lacks something that My Own Prision had--perhaps they lost some of their edge when it all went to their head. There is some amazing guitar work on this album, namely ""What if"", ""Say I"" and ""Wrong Way""- all nicely done. Other than that, the Vocals are as pathetic as a badly done Eddie Vedder impression, the bass follows nicely, but has less effect than on MoP, and the drums are as formulaic and predictable as any other rock record--(Phillips still annoys me with the open hi-hat -> Crash-Crash fill that he does). Aside from the similarity of virtually every song on the album, it still delivers a certain degree of punch--but you keep wondering if you didn't hear that same punch in the song before."
2,Two great songs wrapped around a bunch of filler,"I do like Creed, though many people have endlessly dissed them. Though the Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons are obviously there, I do feel that the band has potential to created their own sound. Their first album, My Own Prison, dealt with Scott Stapp's childhood and adolescence in a highly religious family; the album contained a number of good songs. Their third and best CD, Weathered, shows maturity and range, much like the 1990's version of Metallica. Now comes the second and worst of the three albums, Human Clay. This album is downright unlistenable, with the exception of two songs, the singles Higher and With Arms Wide Open(GREAT bass work on both songs by Brian Marshall). For their next album, I hope they decide to take it to the next level, and not stay in mediocrity. Peace."
1,Formulised Abomination,"After their previous CD, which was not too bad on one or two tracks, ""Human Clay"" came out. More the same stuff, just on a different CD. This CD was truly a step backwards for Creed, if that were ever possible.It seems like Creed tried to add some grunge elements to their music, and it just didn't come off. Abominable tracks like ""Wrong Way"", with occassional ventures into real rock, ""Say I"", that borders on the dismal, and more that truly defy the senses.The pity is that the lyrical content is actually pretty good and has some substance to it. Sadly, the overall execution just didn't cut it and match that.Even for fans of hard rock, this would be a CD to avoid. Don't waste your money."
2,Creed's third album title.......Creed - Ignorant Hobo Clowns,"SERIOUSLY FOLKS...DON'T BUY THIS CD!!! I cannot stress it enough. First off, they have already sold practically 10 million 'Human Clay' albums. Secondly, there is absolutely nothing innovative about their tunes. Nearly every track on the cd begins with an 8-count guitar jingle then ignorantly and so conceivably they'll follow with garbled rock noises with Scott's ailing and bellowing voices of meaningless lyrics. I seriously consider Britney Spears's lyrics much more intricate and complex then that of Creed. Bottom line: Yes, Creed is a great band...a great band to throw rocks at. If you are in search of a great band and you are completely sick of the regeneration in music today...... Listen to Third Eye Blind music....It's a remedy for a lost cause."
1,AMEN!!!,"This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPILATION OF TRIPE I'VE HEARD SINCE BRITNEY SPEARS!!! Creed are uninspired, unoriginal Pearl Jam wannabes.... To me, Creed represents all that is wrong with music in the last ten years and Creeds fans are like so many mindless drones; sheep carelessly off to the slaughter of creativity and free thought. I shudder to think where the human race will end up traipsing off to blindly follow this pathetic, wishy-washing, inane dribble. Did someone say sanctimonious posturing? AMEN, BROTHER!!!!"
1,a band without a niche,"creed blows.it's that simple.this is the worst pile of garbage i've ever listened to!""what if"" is pretty good, but if creed is a hard rock band, what the hell is ""arms wide open""?this album could've been good if it was never recorded and if all the band members left to pursue other career interests, like sweeping up a mall, or taking orders via drive-thru.this is a terrible, brutal, attempt at making music."
1,Pathetic,"This album should not legally be for sale. The tracks are so incredibly disgusting they force you to run to the bathroom. I honestly almost threw up after hearing ""With Arms Wide Open"". i feel sorry for the members of the band excluding the lead singer. I would be constantly nauseasous if I had to listen to a voice like that all the time. Their songs are constantly played on the radio which makes them even more repulsive and the lyrics truly do not seem to make sense. Please, take my advice, do not byut his album!"
1,CRUD,"What a joke. Can anyone listen to ""Arms Wide Open"" and not laugh at the string arrangements? Is this an attempt to sound sophisticated? Weak lyrics, weaker music, and pathetic lyrical arrangements will sell millions for this band just like the rest of these radio-friendly unimaginative corporate cookie-cutter bands. I cant wait for these guys to fade away...."
3,Still Undecided...,"I like this album. I hate this album. I think Scott Stapp is a sincere brooder struggling with inner spiritual conflicts. I think Scott Stapp is a jerk who verbally insulted me at one of his concerts. Sometimes I can't get enough of this disk and other times I think if I hear ""Higher"" one more time I'm going to have to strangle my radio. Obviously I have mixed feelings. As a group, Creed is very talented for being so green. ""Arms Wide Open"" could make any mother cry. The lyrics are nicely mashed together to make moody yet meaningful rock songs. I just wish the lead singer would decide whether he's the Dhali Lama or Johnny Rotten."
1,"Honestly people, they were sued by their own fans...","Everyone has heard about that right? Creed was sued by their own fans for playing crappy live shows ahahaha! It would be really difficult to find a rock album that sucks more than this. Seriously, if you ever feel the desire to buy this piece of garbage, please rethink it and buy the albums that these guys are ripping off and pilfering from. Anything by Pearl Jam or other early nineties rock act would be great. Collectively, we can make America a place where talentless losers like Creed don't become stars with their awful music!"
4,An Emotionally Higher Experience,"I'm a new fan of Creed's, I don't own their first album and I haven't followed their career at all, but most recently I have been taken cative by this amazing group and I'm asking myself why didn't I find them sooner? I have now purchased their second album, Human Clay and I love it. Their songs are written with so much emotion and pain and they really move me. My favorite tracks are With Arms Wide Open and Wash Away Those Years these tracks along with all of them take you on an emotional journey that is spiritual and wondeful. I recommend this to anyone who likes music that means something and to anyone who is searching for meaning in life and in God. This is an awesome album."
4,A solid 4 stars!,"This is my first Creed cd and I'm hooked. This cd is the BOMB! I'm not normally a Rocker, but this cd is a definite plus to my collection of varied music."
3,CREED NEEDS TO MOLD CLAY INTO OTHER FIGURES.,"I like Creed, but the lead vocalist sounds the exact same on every song...with no vocal range or creativity.I like ""Higher"", but it sounds like ""With Arm Wide Open"", which sounds like ""Beautiful"" and so on.It is a good album but I can't listen to it every day....The lead vocalist needs to get away from the same sound....its making it that you can't tell the songs apart.A definite buy for the true CREED fan, otherwise skip it.MY GRADE: B- (production) C+ (songs)"
2,oooh boy....,"Now I've been told by friends that Creed's songs sound a lot alike, but i never trust my friend's opinions. UNFORTUNATELY, i think I'd have to agree this time... particularly since their hits sound a lot alike and I wouldn't have to buy the CD to figure that out (I did anyway...) They're not exactly what I'd classify as ""hard rock"" either... it seems they're just one of many bands with throaty vocals that's popping up in the pop music limelight lately. The CD ain't the greatest I've heard ever, but it ain't the worst either. The real test of how great they are (or not) is if they survive the next five to ten years- and if their music keeps evolving... the mark of any good band is the sound doesn't remain stagnant and changes with the times... and from similarity of songs on their two CD's out, I'm seriously wondering if they will survive..."
5,It will blow you away,"When I first heard ""Higher"" I wondered when Pearl Jam went back to basics. The entire album is moody, deliciously played, and filled with complex lyrics that will make you think. It is a little reminiscent of the Seatle Sound, without screaming half as much. If you love rock, this will blow you away."
5,Creed does it again,This CD Just kicks. The music just makes you feel the lyrics wich I must say are excellent. The lyrics almost draw a picture of what the song's about.
4,"This CD is Beautiful and will Never Die, Say I.","I have to just come on out and say it, i think this CD is amazing and awesome, and any of the other words that you can think of that mean the same thing. And thats all there is to it."
4,Great Album,"I have to admit that I was less then impressed by their last album. Hearing the songs on the radio I felt that they were a knock-off band and I rarely listened. I too like the ""old"" grunge groups like STP and PJ. Creeed has broken out of that old mold though and moved on to another level. While those groups have gone into a down spiral lately and are themselves turning out some crap, Creed has found a new sound and the musical ability to back it up."
3,Good value for money....has more to offer than just ''higher,I knew little of creed before i bought this album and therefore had no expectations (and obvisouly can't compare it to their earlier stuff) but i was pleasantly surprised. There is good variation within the album....coincidently the heavier stuff is all at the beginning and the gentler songs at the end of the album....for convenience! ahh....creed are so considerate :) Stapps vocals are gritty and strong but you can see the contrast within songs like 'inside us all' and 'with arms wide open'. This isn't my favourite CD of all time but is certainly worth the money and is a great addition to any music collection.
1,Kurt Cobain must be spinning in his grave,"Bands like Creed are a prime example of why alternative music is dead.They just took a style of Seattle bands and ripped it off and marketed it too the masses.Although to be fair there are dozens of bands in the past 5 years that are fake too such as Days Of The New,Live,The Nixons,Staind etc."
1,I would rather listen to crows squawk than listen to this cd,"Listening to nothing would be better than listening to such horribly derivative, bland music that Creed churns out. The first time I heard ""With Wide Open Arms"", I originally thought it was by Pearl Jam. This is just bland, middle of the road, average, insipid rock that makes me nauseous to know that this is stuff is popular with millions of people."
2,"Hey, Pearl Jam left behind their old style, let's use that","Okay, these guys are capitalizing off of pearl jam. I will admit that some of the songs are pretty good. They'd be fair compared to anything off of ""ten"", but with today's music seen, their actually pretty good. However, these guys really need to develop their own sound. There is no originality here at all."
2,Redundant,"I want to begin by saying this CD is REDUNDANT. The songs all blend together and are all downcast grumblings about how horrible life is and how we are all damned. It's really too bad, considering their strong first outing, and also considering that the single ""Higher"" is a great song. There are only one or two other good songs on this CD, one of them being the powerful ""Wash Away Those Years"". The listener can discern the extra money that went into production, but the songs are simply not that great. More time between CDs would have been a good remedy. Shame on Creed for pandering to the flavor of the month music trend today popularized by MTV."
5,Great CD for a Great Band,"I had heard Creed before this cd came out but I never cought when the radio said that One and My Own Prison were by creed. I then heard Higher and I thought that it was a great song but I wasn't sure if I'd like the whole cd. Eventually What if came out and I loved it. I went out and bought the cd the day I heard what if and I am so glad I did. It is one of my favorite cds, and creed easily became my favorite band after Red Hot Chili Peppers. All of the songs are awsome and could be a hit on the radio. From the Opening track ""Are you Ready"", it's almost asking you if you're ready to hear a great cd, To the last track ""inside us all,"" which is an excellent end to this cd,you are enjoying every minute."
5,I Know Everything About Everything,"I know everything about this style of music and about this band and about this album. I own all their albums, and all the albums of this style of music, and all the albums ever made. Heck, I own albums that weren't ever made. So when I tell you that this album is good, I'm not talking like some new twit on the block. I've been listening this band before you were ever born, before they ever recorded their first album, before they even thought of recording their first album. I saw these guys in concert so many times, and no one else has ever seen them that many times, so when I say ""great."" I mean ""great"" like a profession and not some casual listener like you out there. Hey, I know. You don't know nothin.' You're stupid, and stupid people like you should listen to me."
4,stainboy says,"Creed is a wonderful new band. I dont know exactly how to describe them. Kind of like Alternative Hard Rock I suppose. I really love this album and am looking foward to buying My Own Prison. My favorites on this CD are: Are You Ready?, What If, Never Die, With Arms Wide Open, and Higher. Creed is a band that I see becoming as popular as The Red Hot Chili Peppers after a few more releases. I give Human Clay, 4 stars..."
2,Can't see anything special on this cd...,"There is simply nothing special on this cd. The music here lacks lots of things. It is very simple and uninspired. Don't get me wrong, I've heard lots of music that is simple yet great. But this one lacks the spirit. It might sound very good to you the first time you listen to it, but eventually you will see that it just gets boring instead of getting deeper. The lyrics are alright, and some are very thoughtfully and emotionally written like Inside Us All. But overall I think the only reason for Creed to get here is commercialisation. There is nothing more to their ""success""."
4,Really good music but not very original,"The music here is really good for what it is, but the thing is that its not very original sounding. Creed sound JUST like Pearl Jam, and Pearl Jam is a lot better. This is basically 90's alternative music which has been a little played out. If you want new rock i suggest Static x or Incubus. Any of you kids who like this stuff should definently get Ten by Pearl Jam. That one is a classic"
1,MY MOUTHS NOT OPEN,this is a horrible band. scott staff cant sing. the muisc is ok. i cant think of anything good to say about them so i will leave it at that
1,This is complete crap!,"I have liked Creed in the past, yet after this album I hate them forever! I threw it straight in my kitty litter box as soon as I heard it. Too bad they lost all of their talent and are just anothing scrounging band trying to get thier 15 minutes of fame. If you are considering buying this Cd, trust me DONT!! Go buy something that has some real music on it- like Manson!"
3,Great voice!,"This music speaks for itself. Here is an example of unique talent and an ability to express one's self to the highest degree without fear of failure or poor reception by others.These young men are very talented, and it's a shame that Christian Rock has closed their doors on them. I don't think I have ever heard a stronger message in song, that would make methink of what God has made and the beauty of it. Don't miss outon this opportunity to listen to poetry wrapped in music, so sweet and melodic."
4,A View of an Italian Crime Novel,It is refreshing to read a book written with insights into another country's legal system. The characters are well developed and the main character's interest in the Seven Deadly Sins place in current society was thought provoking.
4,A thinking reader's mystery,"Nancy in Seattle, WA : A gradually building tale of social nonentites and an offensive old lady with few clues as to the reason for a murder or hwo did it. There are mystical web searches, talking to peripheral individuals, a false scent or two and accidental findings. It is fascinating to read of the Italian justice system."
5,guido brunetto mystery,"I'd read anything that Donna Leon wrote with Guido Brunetti as the main character! Her plots and settings are vqried, and there are always interesting details"
4,Good read!,"Donna Leon consistently writes an engaging mystery. Great attention to detail, lots of twists and turns, and a very personable, ""real"" aspect to Brunetti. A good read!"
3,Doctored Evidence,It was a good book but seemed I could have read the first 1 or 2 chapters then the end and would have been fine. Hard to keep up with who was who and would have like a description of what an Italian word was. Loved all the characters and would like to read another one of her books to see how the characters develope. This was my first book in this series but I think I will give another one a try.
4,"Nice, simple read, with glitters of profound moments","I always like Donna Leon's Guido Brunetti series.The characters are very human, full of ironies and tragic humor.Also enjoyable are the bits and pieces of wisdom delivered through Brunetti's observation of characters around him, not to mention the mouth watering reference to his wife's cooking delicious dishes.Ms leon takes the reader in the heart of a neghborhood and to the bedroom of an Italian society that many of us have yet to exoerience first hand.It's not literature, nor is it a hardcore crime fiction. A simple, good story of life in general.You will like it, just read bit by it, to avoid fatigue.Four stars, because the deduction and revelations about the crimes could be more artful, than dependent on chance factor so much."
5,"Finally, A Great Book On Things From 1940 - 1980's",At last here is a great book on the lures that you can still aford to buy & that many of us now remember fishing with in our younger days. This book gave me lots of new things to look for that I did not even know about & it was a fun read in addition to many great color photo's. This guy is doing volume 2 for August 2002 release which I have on pre-order & can't wait to get my hands on!
3,Not bad...but could have been better.,"This book contains lots of information, but could have been so much better. It is basically a show-and-tell of the authors collection."
4,Realistic Collectables,"A great book for someone not interested in the ""old""pricy lures.The lures described and photographed in this book , canstill be found and collected without breaking the bank. The many size & colors of Modern Era lures , make them fun and affordable to collect.This is Vol #1 and there is now a Vol # 2 published."
1,Disappointing,"Nice pictures but beyound that I'm afraid like so many lure sellers this book is worthless.VERY few value estimates, and the product completeness is very poor. Save your money."
4,Lush horns/keys,"If you like blues with a full horn section, you'll like this. Austin's keyboard playing is great -- especially if you're a sucker for B3 sounds, as I am -- and the Blues Brothers' horns sound as good as you'd expect them to.The only downside to this is some relatively weak female lead vocals on a few cuts. But other than that, highly recommended."
4,A music fan from South Spain,I'm an Antonio Molina music fan. He was one of the most importants singers of the twentieth century. His tenor voice has been insuperable and his songs were very appreciated in his time.
3,Year's Best Fantasy and Horror 15,"This latest edition contains useful discussions of fantasy and horror publications over the last year (2000-1). I've noticed that increasing attention is given to small press items which most readers will have trouble getting their hands on, as well as media, anime, etc. which are of less interest to me. It was disappointing to see that horror novels were just listed, not discussed. Still, the fantasy section described several works that I'll be seeking out.Stories in this anthology have over the years become increasingly literary and perhaps are not the most accessible examples of the genre. Imagery and style take precedence over plot and character in most of the works reprinted here. Perhaps the best story in the volume was one about a boy who ""swallows a faerie"", an elegant metaphor for creativity and its repression--I regrettably forget the author but recommend the piece. Also, Norman Partridge contributed a strong work of historical fantasy."
4,A fairy who loves chocolate,[...] I really enjoyed Fairy Treasure. I like Gwyneth Rees books and read Mermaid Magic before. There are 236 pages in the book but I like the way the print is not too small. It makes it very easy to read. I like all the characters all the things they get up to. I think the book is funny with a few surprises. I am now starting to read Gwyneth Rees next book - Fairy Dreams.
2,There are better and worse...,"This particular slant on Catullus is not my favorite. The editor really seems to aim this book at those who have extensive knowledge of the Classical Languages. (some of the commentary is in attic greek) I am a high school student taking AP Latin who was given this text by my teacher because the book that I am supposed to be using is backordered. It takes me on the average twice as long to translate with this book than when I borrow the text that I should be working off of. (The Student's Catullus, by Garrison) Catullus, by Fordyce is not for the average student of latin, rather for the average latin teacher."
4,Cute set addition,"If you didn't get too many people in your purchase of the train sets, be sure to grab these. They're really cute to set around the tracks and ""pretend"" you have a city. They're jointed so they move rather easily and can be positioned different ways. We particularly like the firemen that came with our sets. These get a lot of play and some even became superheroes!"
5,Well-done,"This is not pop, and I think Bryan is happy about that. What it is, is an emotion-filled soul album with remarkable performances from all. His voice is amazing, and the songs are very good. I highly recommend it for the gospel fan."
5,Everthing One Could Possibly Need to Know,"This is an exceptional guide for the retiree who is thinking about where to retire. Because it is so beautifully written, it reads like a novel. It gives one a real taste of Ireland, as if one is actually there. The author has covered every possible thing that I can think of that one needs to know before making an educated choice about where to retire. An excellent read, yet extremely practical at the same time. I heartily recommend it even for those who are years away from retiring, as, obviously, that's when the planning needs to begin."
3,be warned,"If you are looking at purchasing this book, keep in mind the date it was published. Alot has changed in ireland since 1999. Ireland is now on the euro, which means, your U.S retirement dollar will not go as far. Also, the housing prices have skyrocketed in ireland. The housing prices listed in the book just aren't there any more. The book does give alot of valuable iformation. Just keep in mind that it is a little out of date."
2,Snook is poorly edited,This story is not my favorite in the Lassiter series. There was a lot more Florida information in this book and it took away from the flow of the story.The biggest problem is technical and frustrating. Numerous segments of text were missing. This issue needs to be fixed to follow the story.
4,Lassiter - solid court room dynamics,"I almost quit on this one early on - slow to develop, too much development of support characters? Glad I didn't. Fun read."
3,Not the best Lassiter but still riveting,"I discovered Levine a few weeks ago and have been making my way through both his Lassiter and the Solomon and Lord series. This one presents a fascinating legal problem since we see Lassiter's client kill her father in the first few pages. There appears to be no whodunit but ......After the murder, there is a great deal of dawdling and repetition so I have to admit that I skimmed some pages. But the last third really picks up, has an excellent courtoom scene and can't be put down. Overall, a very good read."
5,Murder not as simple as it seems,"FLESH & BONES is the seventh Jake Lassiter novel, and the first novel I've read entirely in eBook form. Though Jake witnesses what appears to be a clear case of murder, he is surprisingly able to cast doubt on who was really responsible for the shooter's actions, taking jurors and readers with him."
4,Always enjoy the Jake Lassiter books,"This book did not disappoint. Typical Jake Lassiter. If you like Paul Levine, or flawed lawyers you should give this book a try."
4,Jake,This was a typical Lassiter book and was what I expected. I mean that in a good way! Keep them coming.
3,Interesting,"Interesting story, especially if you are a Floridian. Gives you insight into some shady dealings, and you cheer for the man to bring the story to its rightful conclusion."
4,Made me a fan.,"Adeptly done legal thriller. I picked this up and couldn't put it down--as cliche as that sounds. Paul Levine is a writer of exceptional standard. This single piece has made me a big fan, and I recommend this book to any lover of good thriller story. It's worth a darn good ride."
5,Great Book!,"I received a complimentary copy of the book ""Flesh & Bones"" by Paul Levine in exchange for my review.Wow! What a pleasant surprise! This book was extremely well written, contained many interesting characters, and it kept me guessing! All of those qualities are extremely important to me. My favorite thing about this book was the character development. As I read, I realized I really liked several of the characters and that says a lot!I really enjoyed this story and can't wait to read Paul Levine's other books."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I have to say that although Flesh and Bones had it's entertaining moments, I found it a bit too schmaltzy and I felt some of the details went on and on and bored me silly. I normally like this style of writing, but this book was a huge disappointment to me. Can't say that I would recommend it. I was given a complimentary copy of this book to review.Robin"
4,First time reader for this author,"I usually enjoy reading books that are part of a series; just get really disappointed when there are no new ones to read. I will now make a point of picking up book one of the Jake Lassiter series and go from there. I especially enjoyed Kip and the remarks he made about old movies. Maybe he and Tony (from NCIS) should get together in a new series (they seem to be soul mates. As for the current story about a model and her past, there were interesting twists and turns although I did figure out early on where the plot was going. I was a little unhappy with the ending but all in all a good read. I received a free copy of this book for review purposes."
3,Not my favorite,This legal thriller grabbed my interest from the start. The beginning had romance and mystery and I did not want to put it down. Somewhere in the middle of the book I felt like I was reading the same the over and over again. I felt like I was missing something when he was with the family like I had walked in on the middle of story.(I found out after finishing that it was not the first in the series). If I did not hate quiting things this book would have been deleted. I am glad I stuck it through to the end. The end of the book grabbed my interest again mainly because the story line acutally changed up a little. The ending was so good that I am considering reading the second one to seeif Jake and Chrissy continue with their relationship. I also was not a fan of the constant movie trivia and references.I gave it 3 stars based on the beginning and ending.I received acomplimentary copy of the book in exchange for my review.
1,Hideous typography,"The oh-so-topical references quickly date the book. More intrusive for me was the horrible Kindle formatting, which jammed subsections of chapters together with no typographical hint that the scene was changing; it was as if the original had spaces and lead-in sentences in some font or color that has somehow been omitted from the Kindle edition."
5,dictionary,"Product was just what we were looking for, at a good price and arrived in a timely fashion looking like it just came off the press."
3,"Good, but too big for me","Good dictionary, nice feature--phonetic transliteration of russian words. But it's bigger than i want to carry around"
4,Not Sturdy Enough for my Daughter,"My daughter is just 2 years old, and she has a hard time sitting in this seat. It is recommended for 3 years and up, so that may be why. However, whenever she sits down in it the chair tends to roll to one side or the other. I didn't realize it was inflatable, and should have gone with something a little more sturdy. So, it may not be a product fault but an age issue. If your child doesn't sit smack down in the middle of a seat every time, it might be something to consider. She loves the chair, but it seems to have turned into more of a chair for her dolls now."
1,Not at all what we thought.,"This ""chair"" has a lip on the back of it making it where it doesn't even sit up right. When the kids sit in it, they slide out. It is very hard to get the cover on it correctly and it doesn't hold air. I would NOT buy this item if I had it to do over again."
1,Poorly made but cute chair.,My daughter got this chair from Santa on Christmas morning and shortly after sitting in it the chair tipped sideways and dumped her out. She was unharmed however we realized then that the chair had to go. The chair has a big buldge in the back I guess to keep it from falling backward but it forces the child sitting in it to sit forward and that is not comfortable. The soft cover is nice but the blow up design and durability for the price does not add up. I am going to find a nice bean bag chair to replace it with.
4,Cute,"My daughter has the whole Rose Petal Cottage and also got this as part of her set. I do like it but she doesn't really use it as much as the other items. Our cat actually sleeps in it more than anything, it is very cute though."
2,"Cute, but doesn't last","If your little girl has an older brother/cousin, this won't last. A few times of him sitting on it hard (and her mimicking him) popped it so it wouldn't inflate again. It was cute while it lasted, though."
3,Fun Chair but hard to use,"We have a two year old who uses this chair and seems to like it a lot for reading books and playing in her doll house. The chair is inflatable and can be hard to inflate to the ""full"" look.The chair is often found turned over and is difficult for her to get out of on a regular basis."
3,"Good chair but, not stable enough",Everything is fine with this chair except my 1 year old daughter falls out occasionally because it doesn't have enough of a solid base. It's air inside instead of cushion so if she moves around to much it sort of bounces her out. She does seem to really like it though. A child who fell out onto a hard surface might get hurt.
1,Very disappointed,"This chair did not last long as it kept deflating. Also, it was angled forward so the child will slide right out. It takes constant effort to stay in this chair. I loved the rest of the rose petal cottage accessories, but this was a definite dud!"
1,CRAP.,"My daughter received this chair as a Christmas present, and it deflated within minutes. Don't waste your time. While it was blown up, the fabric did not even fit correctly."
2,"Doesn't stay inflated, difficult to sit in","I purchased this chair before Christmas for less than half of retail and thought I was getting a good deal. I should have read the reviews more closely.My daughter was 18mo at Christmas, and she had a hard time sitting in the chair. It sloped forward and made it difficult for her to sit in the seat without sliding out. We tried letting some air out in hopes that would help, but it didn't.After just a couple days, we began noticing the chair deflating. We couldn't find the leak. I was going to use it to hold her dolls, but with it deflating, it won't work for that either.Spend your money on something else -- this chair isn't worth it!"
3,Okay Chair,"I bought this chair for less than half of the normal price so I feel like I got my money's worth. It is a cute chair and is just the right size for my 2 year old. I wouldn't buy this for an older child. It might last her for a little while, but larger kids may be too big for it. Also, it is a blow up chair with a fabric covering. I knew this when I ordered it, however, the fabric doesn't attach in anyway to the seat of the chair. The area around the seat and arms of the chair never stays put. I think there should have been velcro or something to stick the fabric to the plastic. I was not terribly impressed with this chair but thankfully I didn't pay full price for it, it would NOT have been worth it!"
2,Not that great...,"We bought the Rose Petal Cottage Petal Lounge chair for our daughter last year for Christmas. At the time, she was 18 months and very petite. Not a great chair at all. She couldnt sit in it, would fall to the side. Sadly the chair didnt make it to Valentines day. He brother, who was only 29 months at the time, sat in it and the seam popped. This christmas (2008) we bought the playhouse and the table/chair set for her. She is now 30 months. The Table and chair are the same deal, not durable at all. Thank god I didnt pay full price. (The house is great and worth it if you can find it for under $50)"
5,Wild wolf love!,"I loved this book. it has to do with a princess who had a twin, however she did not know this. One, of course is a good person, and the other is bad. Anyways, the 7th child of a twin was predicted that had to marry a man which change from man to wolf, and convereted himself in other shapes. the thing of the story is that the bad twin wants to be wealthy and usurps the place of her sister, which by the way knew that she had a twin. Seem interesting?, Want to know more? You gonna have to buy this book, It's worth your money."
5,"Pure, Deep Romance. Beautiful and heart- melting.","The romance between the two main characters is so pure and unspoiled, I couldn't put the book down. I wanted to read more and more of it. The love scenes are actually quite tame, but the passion is through the roof. The characters are totally connected, even in thoughts and dreams. Beautiful story!Plenty of excitement and surprise twists. Never once did the story get boring.Excellently written, so you feel a connection with many of the characters of the story. You feel their losses and victories.I have a new respect for Madeline Baker."
5,"Great book, but basic Spanish skills necessary!","I thought that this book was very helpful in allowing me to speak with patients in Spanish, teaching me much of the health profession vocabulary that is neglected in most normal Spanish courses. However, it is NOT for someone just beginning to learn the Spanish language. It does not go into detail on basic information or words in Spanish, but offers a practical review of basic Spanish grammar and conjugations. That being said, I had 3 semsters of Spanish in college (almost 8 years ago), and felt that it gave me enough review, as well as greatly added to my Spanish vocabulary."
3,Not for Beginner,"The text is good for intermediate Spanish speaker. The book does not give you basic list of numbers, days, months or years in Spanish. The DVD is too advanced for me. The DVD is nothing more than conversational situations--no English translation. It is not a teaching guide or instructional media. The product is not what I expected."
3,Medical Spanish Text: A Conversational Approach,This is a nice book to have if you have had some Spanish and need a refresher and need to learn new vocabulary. It is not organized to be a begginer Spanish book.
1,Worst of the worst.,"Perhaps the most horrible video of the rock era,.Terrible video quality.,insipid camera angles,cheap packaging,newsreel quality footage,non-remastered sound,no special features,no information at all.Cheapo cheapo production.The performances sound ok in a muddy mono mix,but the video is so out of sync it is impossible to watch without gritting your teeth.Has the rare performances of Bye Bye Johnny and All Aboard,but that's about all it has going for it,Unless you are a hardcore Kinks collector and need everything,avoid this mercifully short turkey at all costs."
1,No Extension Cable,We ordered a firewire extension cable. We received a firewire cable. When we requested the correct extension cable we were told that no extension cable was available. They did refund our money though.
4,Great to start with,"If you like to start a russian language collection, you need to start with this CD, this is a soundtrack to a New Year's movie viewed in Russia, popular artists sing older songs,givs you a great idea of what russian pop music is like today."
5,Great read,Bought this book to help me prepare for our new puppy. What a great purchase. I would recommend this book.
1,There are beautiful labs waiting for you in the SHELTER!,"The author writes about finding reputable lab breeders, but says nothing of the fact that there are so many labs (many of them purebreds) waiting in the shelter to be adopted into loving homes.Besides including breeder information, he could have also listed the names of organizations specifically geared towards rescuing labs from high kill shelters. (Labs4Rescue, PAWS, etc.) We adopted our lab puppy from Labs4Rescue from a high kill shelter in Louisiana, and he is a purebred beautiful yellow lab who was on the put to sleep list. It was very difficult to read the breeder information knowing now what I do about labs in shelters across the US.Please- consider adopting your lab from a reputable rescue organization!"
4,Great for Companion Pet Training,"This is an excellent place to start training your Lab. The author will take you through everything from house-breaking to basic commands (sit, stay, down, come) and even some tricks. The author takes advantage of the incredibly high food drive of Labs, and uses that to teach them things without negative reinforcement. This book will help you do a good job of what it is designed to accomplish -- train a pet.However, you need to know what you're buying. If you want a lot of information on the history of the breed, I recommend trying another book such as Labrador Retreiver: The Dog That Does It All. On the other hand, if you will be field training your pooch, then I recommend a couple of ""oldies but goodies,"" such as Gun Dog or Water Dog, by Richard Wolters.Either way -- get the books before you get the dog -- and read them."
5,A must have book for all lab owners,"We have a 6 month old black lab. She has been a handful to say the least. We have looked at training videos online, gone to a puppy classes, and read several books. This is the best book by far for understanding our baby girl. I would highly suggest this book to any existing or potential lab owner."
4,Pretty good book,"I liked the way this book communicates. well written.It actually explains how to train the dog by giving examples and steps.I tried some items and have seen them to work.A good amount of the tips I already knew about and follow out of instinct.So it is not totally impressive but surely it puts thoughts in a structured context and refreshes old concepts.Training is not only about when to sit and when to fetch, it is about being able to communicate with your poochie friend. If you cannot communicate, then, you cant train (not predictable results for sure) the poochie.This book gets to the basics of what actually is being communicated by each (a lot if not all) of general behaviours we go through with our Labs.All in All, a really good Beginer's book to training.cheersRanjith"
5,great family memories,"Our children (now college and grad students) listened to this tape (as it was then) OVER and OVER during our long car trips to and from Colorado in the summer. Despite the endless repetition, we have the fondest memories of these cheery tunes. I have been known (still) to say to my husband as we near a destination by air: ""This is your Captain speaking. We'll be at Grandmother's house in half an hour."" Just a hint to young parents: if you would be happy for your kiddies to go to Stanford, let them play paper and pencil games and look out the window and sing along to music. They don't need videos and Gameboys! You will be so glad later, when they appreciate the world around them, love to read books, and can carry on a real conversation. End of sermon (sorry!)! Great little music ""tape,"" regardless!"
1,"Wtf is this crap, All these songs are knock off's",These songs are horrible knock-off's of the originals and sound like garbage. I can't believe ppl are buying these over the originals. People please listen to the original and you'll see. How can you attempt to mimick Phil collins or cyndie lauper... insanity.
1,Save your money,"If you enjoy singing on par with drunken karaoke bar patrons, this CD is for you! If not, better alternatives abound..."
4,all about trucks,Tough Trucks is a simple picture book with very few words per page. It tells about all sorts of trucks in the world. Each page has a picture of a truck with the job that it does. Each of the trucks are operated by cute little cartoon like animals that caught the attention of my 2 year old sister. This book is really neat for boys and girls for all ages.The pictures are very colorful. In back in has a page where it explains tractors parts if you are not familiar with some of the words used in the book.I would recommend this book to children ages 4-7. Lots of kids like to read about truck and transportation
5,Perfect For My 2yo!,"He got a copy of Tony Mitton's 'Terrific Trains' for his 2nd birthday - and he LOVED it so much, we decided to get him a copy of 'Tough Trucks' too.Unsurprisingly, he loves it as well! It's a nice size book - 8x8inches - with bright, colorful pictures and not too many words per page. (Which is important, because little ones get bored if there are too many sentences each page!) The story rhymes and flows easily, so it's not too much of a mouthful to read, like some other rhyming stories.I have purchased more books from this series for friends children, too - and will buy more from the series for my son, too! Great books!!"
4,Bought for a 3 year old.,"I sent it to my ""Literacy Buddy"" in a pre-k program. He had requested a book about trucks. He liked it."
4,Bright Pics but not High Quality - good for price!,"The pictures are nice and colorful. I was expeciting a hard copy book but it is a soft copy book. But, I got it for only 4 bucks....so.....it is a great deal still."
5,Avalible at Target only,Went to Target and found this movie was so excited so any one looking for it can find it there
4,Great flick Great Price,Great flick--no movie is ever perfect but this is a great representation of the theatre. DO NOT GET RIPPED off..This DVD is a TARGET exclusive (only sold new thru Target)--go to any Target in the USA and you can buy it brand new for $14.99. All other sellers bought it from Target for $14.99 and now are passing it on to you at a sharply increased price. NO Target nearby..got to Target's website and order it. I love Amazon but this is bogus trying to sell an in-print $15 dvd for nearly double.
3,A tour de force by Christian Mckay,"Richard Linklater has always been one with an ear for the gab. In his movies dialogues don't just exist to fill in the silent moments, but they are there because it reflects the feel of the movie and the ethos of the character. This movie is no exception. It reminds you of the 50s and 60s where the banter and repartee was a marked characterstic of Bogart movies.Christian Mckay is a revelation. As Orson Welles, he brings every bit of the gravitas, arrogance and brilliance that the role demands. He moves effortlessly among the various skins of Orson Welles - from the stubborn artist to the brilliant actor and everything in between.Apart from McKay, Claire Danes is wonderful as the career minded icequeen. Zac Efron is passable as the rookie.Definitely worth a watch"
2,Zero Chemistry,There is no chemistry between the leads and the whole film is missing a spark. Something is just missing.
1,wtf,"This price is wrong, right? $969.00.I understand that there are 2 unreleased versions of the movie. Perhaps this is one of them. In one version Welles eats the entire cast 40 minutes into the movie. The other, I understand, has Zac totally nude throughout the movies. Still not worth the price. I hope you all understand hyperbole."
1,Low Brow and Uninspired,"After the first 15 minutes of this movie, you're left wondering if there is a likable character in it. The low brow sex references are appallingly juvenile. If you are the type of person who can't stop watching until you know if the play opens on Thursday or not, you'll love this movie. If, however, you demand substance and depth in a film, this is one to pass on. If you're only going to watch this because you're a Claire Danes fan, watch Temple Grandin instead."
3,Pockets are a bit small,The pockets are on the small side. Thick pantyhose and tights barely fits. It is okay for regular sheer pantyhose and nothing thicker. . .
5,Best invention ever!!,"I LOVE THIS THING! I keep my pantyhose AND swim suits in it, I love it! It works awesome as a space saver, and I can organize all my things in it.. I'm thinking on buying more and they make a great gift also!"
3,Just OK,"The item does its job, but I've found that thicker stockings do not fit in the small compartments...they are rather shallow and look like they're only meant to hold pantyhose-like stockings. The back of the item has larger pockets, though. Overall, good design...compact and fits nicely in closet, but would probably not buy again or recommend."
5,I used it as a shoe organizer for my baby,"Before i bought this, there are always whole bunch of baby shoes by the door. And my baby would pick her shoes, play with them, chew on them and leave them wherever. This is a perfect solution for my situation!"
5,Brilliant,"I love this organizer for pantyhose. The sizes of the pouches are perfect, it takes up a tiny bit of hangar space, and it's so easy to find what I'm looking for. By far the best storage solution I've ever had for stockings."
3,Why did you choose this rating?,"I like the front slots to hold panty hose, Should have the same slots of the back also to hold panty hose."
5,Good Charlotte Never Dissapoints!,"Okay I have to say it this is probably the best CD I have ever bought. No kidding. With the catchy riffs and drum beats and Joel's ... vocals you cannot help but love the Album. Tracks such as ""Emotionless"", ""Hold On"", and ""The Day That I Die"" Benji and Joel give their fans an insight on their life. Mixed with humor and grief GC also gives their fans and listeners something to relate to. Benji also lended his vocals to track 11 ""The Day that I Die"" ,with Benji and his ... scratchy vocals you cannot help but to listen to the track over and over. Well Joel, Benji, Billy, and Paul has not yet to dissapoint their fans. So go out and buy their album already!"
2,To all the people dissin GC thinking they're cool,"Read all the reviews of this album. Every review that says something like 'this is not real punk , if you want real punk listen to this and that' is written by a complete idiot. Stop talking about genres because they don't exist. Once you get this you will be capable of writing a good review. Genres are just names made to put cd's on the shelves , to categorize music, but that's it. What's important is, if you like what you hear or not. Now with that being said , I don't like this cd and I don't like GC , but I got nothing against them, period."
1,THEY MAKE ME WANT TO DAMAGE MY EAR DRUMS,"THIS BAND IS THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF CORPORATE POSEURS EVER!! The only thing more sickening than the members of this band are the people that are obssesed with them. This is the kind of band that is ruining music. They are a bunch of corporate sellouts , with girly voices , they cant play their instruments and they are NOT PUNK!! The only people that should listen to this (well if it were up to me they would be arrested for crimes against music, and no one would be allowed to listen to this ) are teeny boppers.This kind of garbage should not sell so well, let alone they shouldn't be signed by any record label. Fortunately for those like me how hate this band with a passion there is hope. I have succesfully converted some of their fans in to good charlotte haters , i we all band together and convert others to not listen we can get rid of this band forever and save music. NOW DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND GO PICK UP SOME GOOD MUSIC AT YOUR LOCAL RECORD STORE!"
5,ANOTHER AWESOME CD BY GOOD CHARLOTTE,"When Good charlotte first came on the scene 2 years ago, they took the world by storm. The power of their music was strong and focused on one thing...entertaining their fans. Their new cd, ""The Young and the Hopeless"" offers even better music than their first cd. From start till stop, you will be amazed by both the lyrics and the style of music. I would definately recommend this cd!!"
1,Real punk or fake punk? Uh...fake,"How many people have to tell the fans of this album or band that this isn't punk or that this sucks. ""But Wheredidthisguygo, this isn't punk, it's pop-punk."" Well, I think that Pop-punk has to be the worst genre of rock music ever,of all time; the music of pop-punk is unoriginal, generic, and worst of all, it just plain sucks. ""But I'm only 13."" Being 13 is no excuse for listening to crap like this. Eleven bands (two of them are REAL PUNK bands) I would recommend instead of Good Charlotte (How can I only choose 11?):Violent FemmesToolMuseRed Hot Chili PeppersJane's AddictionBad ReligionThe ClashGlassjawA Perfect CircleThe Mars VoltaThriceI'm tired of the stereotype that all 13 year-olds listen to this. I'm 13 and I listen to music that GC fanboys and fangirls have never heard of. If you must have a pop-punk album, buy Make A Sound by Autopilot Off."
5,Incredible,Wow these guys are the best. They make me feel so punk and awesome. The bustin beets make me feel happy. Wow MTV loves this stuff so I do too. I feel so gangster. Just like when I listen to Ja Rule with all my buddies from the Gap. There hair is so bright and colorful- it makes me feel happy. Amazing. the Anthem is the greatest song ever. Life fo' sure. Word. Tell your mom i said hi.
1,OH BRAVO BRAVO,"I'd like to say that I listen to a lot of genres of music, varying from rap to punk and this band is pitiful. They carry out simple little melodies and they wear cute little punky outfits and BOOM, it's Mtv magic. But its not magic. The one thing that a band needs to make a decent album is creativity and overall talent, and this band lacks both of those things. It's not a matter of if they are punk or not, its just a simple matter of whether or not this band has put out a good album. And they have not. Good Charlotte ought to be changing their name to Mediocre Charlotte."
1,These guys are as punk as Martha Stewart,"GC sucks. They can't play their instruments but that shouldn't matter in punk. What they don't have is real punk attitude. Sure they got nose rings and spiked hair but these guys are just corporate stooges. They are a boyband with guitars & dirty clothes. They are safe, friendly & the complete opposite of real punk. They are not rebels and make catchy disposable ""punk rock"". At least their 15 minutes are almost up they will be as remembered as Winger."
1,What are you people thinking?!?,"How can you think of this as music? Its manufactured punk! Punk can't be popular. Look at them. They should be playing death metal with that messed-up (and dorky) look, and yet they're singing happy tunes about rich people. I just don't get it."
1,GOOD CHARLOTTE SUCKS!!!,"(...)I understand that music is a matter of opinions and that not every one will like rock and not every one will like classical. But not liking Good Charlotte, is a matter of seperating talented and untalented. Want some real punk? Listen to THE CLASH!!! And if that's too old for you, BLINK 182 ROCKS!!!"
1,deffintly young and hopeless,"all i gotta say is this sucks pretty good. some pop punk is good i like certain bands, im more punk, ska and screamo kinda music, but hey, anyone can see these guys wrote ""mainstream 101"" music, anything that appeals to teens and will sell. these guys have no talent. if u like this, i suggest bands that are good, like yellowcard, alkaline trio, millencolin,old the ataris,and of course green day."
1,"Oh, boy","I'm ashamed to say I used to like these guys. But the more I listened to them, the more I began to hate them. Alot of people are saying this is punk, but these days it's hard to tell what real punk is. I also got Blindside's Silence Album along with this, and I have to say I enjoyed listening to them more than Good Charlotte."
2,"Tired pop rock, not pop punk","I""m tired of people calling this pop-punk because there's no such thing. This is lite rock for the mainstream MTV kids who are brainwashed zombies. The songs are old and annoying. I can listen to their first cd which is much better and hear this one. The only reason it got two stars was for The Day That I Die, but you should download the acoustic version it's much better."
1,why im a even giving this junk review,WORST BAND EVER IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC TODAY!!! GOOD JOB GOOD CHARLOTTE U BUNCH OF FAGGETS!!!
3,NOT punk---more pop...,You would think Good Charlotte would be a punk music type of band but really they are more pop music....i still like the cd tho its cool
5,Beats Busted Anyday!,"I have just bought this CD and I have to say that it's fast become my favourite! My sister say's that it's awful so I guess it's a matter of taste (although she lieks Busted so I have to say, what taste?) You may not call them punk/rock/Goth or whatever but I call them talented. You can certainly relate to their songs which is more than I can say for many other bands.I say borrow the CD for a library or a mate before deciding."
5,Will they survive MTV?,"Buy this CD. I just figured I'd get that out of the way early.Although, I'm not sure if Good Charlotte really qualifies as ""punk"" anymore, but there aren't too many CD's that you can pop in and listen to the whole thing, and enjoy almost every song on it. The songs on this CD are well written, with genuine emotion. You can tell many of the songs are based on their own experiences (""Emotionless"", ""The Young and the Hopeless"", ""Movin' On"",) and they even have a little fun at the expense of others (""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" and ""Girls and Boys"".)Sell-outs? Maybe, but if nothing else they're getting the exposure they deserve. I just hope there's something left by the time MTV is done with them. They're a good band, I'd like to see more CDs from these guys."
2,Bad Album,"Well let me start out by sayin that I use to like these guys, but then they sold out. This album is a polar opposite of their 1st and has absolutly no punk sound. I admit The Anthem is a good song but after hearing it, you get really tired of it.This album has a poppy sound that is too produced and fake. If you are a fan of simple plan I would recomend this album to you because it sounds similar to it. But if you're looking for a good punk album, like their first one, then it would be in your best intrest to not buy this. If you do like punk, I would pick up Slick Shoes, they are awesome"
1,Piece of Crap,"I cannot believe that people like this band. Maybe if your cheesy and don't even know what punk is then listen to GC. GC is more like soft rock in a sense. No yelling, no good guitar, just a crap filled cd. I mean maybe ""The Anthem"" and ""Hold On"" are alright and i can stand them somewhat. But the rest just doesn't cut it. They're pure pop posers. Sure they look punk and act punk, but their music doesn't refelct it in the least. I give it a 1/2 star. So if you want to listen to sell outs then buy GC's albums. Everyone knows who GC is. Thats not the sense with real punk bands. Other bands are more underground, no one knows much about them. Really, please take my advice, GC just isn't punk. But if you like GC they stick with pop singers such as Jessica Simpson. Have fun listening to your ""great"" music."
1,horrible,"this is not punk. this is not punk. not punk. i'm sorry, but if you want to take some 80's pop and add guitars and bad voices, go right ahead, but dont call it punk. if you want to wear your wristbands and cut up shirts just like the members of GC, go right ahead, but dont consider yourself punk. punk is a lifestyle, not the way you wear your hair. try listening to something real, like taking back sunday."
1,Go blank your best friends ass,"There are 3 kinds of people in this world: The people who like good charolette, the people who don't like good charlotte and the people who don't care or know who the hell good charolette is. If you're someone who falls in the first categorey, you're doomed... take lots of pills and drink and play ""Anthem"" while you and your BUDDIES practice muttering your last words in between seizures."
1,THE MOST ANNOYING RECORD EVER RELEASED,"SOMEONE PLEASE END THE TERROR, THIS POP PUNK WAVE IS DRIVING ME OUT OF MY MIND, There is no diffrence between this band and the backstreet boys, both spend more time on makeup than music, and are complete products of the corprate music industry, created to make money and nothing more. About as punk as sesamee street if you ask me!"
1,THIS CD MAKES BLINK 182 LOOK GOOD,I listened to this cd today and i had to cover my ears and scream because songs such as young and the hopeless and boys and girls and the anthem all SUCK these guys need to retire while they're at an all time low. if you listen to this wannabe punk CRAP then that's you're problem.you have to be weird to listen and worship this good for nothing piece of GARBAGE.i wish these guys along with blink would just quit doing music because they take up space on radio and MTV.if these guys release another cd i promise that i will scream and lose it because these idiots aren't even worth thinking about listening to.
5,does it live up to the gc name?,"i was so worried about whether the new gc album would live up to their debut. i hold their music up to a higher standard than most bands, and would have been really disappointed had this cd been only average. its true that the young and the hopeless has a very different sound to it than the first cd, but in my opinion, its just as good. it has its share of good ol classic gc songs, songs that could fit right in with their last cd, like anthem and lifestyles of the rich and famous. but it also has songs that are poppy....in a good way. listen to the day that i die and riot girl and movin on. this is pop the gc way, and it makes me happy. somehow, no matter what genre theyre covering, they manage to make it sound good. this one does live up to their first, and then some. best tracks: anthem, lifestyles, girls and boys, die that i die, emotionless, and movin on."
4,Overall the cd was pretty kick ass,"I really like Good Charlotte, although I havent been a fan for more then 2 years.No.I am not a teeny bopper.On with the CD review!I thought that the CD was fresh and it's great that Benji sung a lot more giving it more of an edgy attitude."
5,Good Charlotte ROCKZ!!,"This CD kicks (....)!!! If you don't have it you need to get it NOW!! My favorite is THe Young and The Hopeless. All the other songs are so good i can't choose a favorite from the rest. AND...if the songs weren't enough good for ya then what better than to have HOTT band members...BENJI, JOEL, PAUL, and BILLY.....YUMMM!! if you absolutely, positively, in no way like the cd...then you better still like the boyz!! alright kidz, im out. Hit ya up later."
5,you have to get this cd!,"hey I just got the new cd yesterday, and I love every song on the cd, its not one of those cds that only has a couple of good songs and you have to skip the rest, If you get this CD you will love it...trust me! and it has vidios that you can see on your computer and more! you wont be dissapointed. Good Charlotte is wicked awesome! lol"
5,GC- the young and the hopeless,"Good Charlotte - The Young and the Hopeless..it has to be one of the best cds to be recorded lately. The songs focus on things that many people have or are currently going through. It really helps you deal with whatever your problem may be by just listening to the lyrics. The songs deal with problems such as losing friends/ family,high school, materialism, forgiveness, and holding on. I recommend this cd for anyone, no matter what your age or any problems you may have or not have. If my mom likes this cd any of you will!"
4,Not Good. Not Bad,"I got into Good Charlotte several months ago, and I've been a hardcore punk fan... MisFits, Nirvana, Godsmack... and I do like The Ataris as well. But Good Charlotte is a good group whether you people like it or not. Maybe I just relate with them, but this album isn't their best, I recommend the first one because the Anthem, Life Styles of the Rich and Famous, and even Riot Girl are 'pop'. If you can get past them, it's an awesome album. And the first album is a thousand times better. Trust me. And I also recommend The Ataris."
5,I love this CD!,"I listen to it almost every day. My favorite songs are the Anthem, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, and Girls and Boys. Highly recommended!"
2,dont bother unless...,"ok. first of all good charlotte is not that great. i didnt buy the cd i just heard it at my girl friends house. honestly i don't know why she has it. this is just one of the many bands who's look does not fit their music. they look like hadcord punks but they are one of the most poopiest bands i know. i belive they are lyriclly chanlenged. this mainly shows in ""girls and boys"" The only reason i give it two stars is because there are only bout 3 good songs on it. If you like pop bands go ahead and buy it but if your not dont bother."
3,PUNK ROCK ROCKS!,"There is no way to put this lightly. Good Charlotte is not a pioneer band. Thier style is not original, and thier message is not one we are not already familiar with. But somehow the music sounds like all of the above. Songs like ""The Anthem,"" ""Day that I Die,"" and ""Moving On,"" will stick in your head for months without showing signs of letting go. The music is THAT good.I'm personally more keen to the groups like Marilyn Manson and Cradle of Filth, but Good Charlotte ranks up there pretty high too. The melodies are suprisingly refreshing, mirroring the styles of Nirvana (who doesn't love them?) and other punk bands. For once in history, though, Good Charlotte makes an imprint that the others do not, probably due greatly to their amazing blend of killer guitars and drums with vocals.Believe me when I say you won't regret purcasing 'The Young and the Hopeless,' it's purely the Greatest CD by the boys from Good Charlotte.---GIGI"
5,"Punk, who cares?","so what if this c.d. is under punk? the songs may be punk, but that doesn't really matter. benji and joel madden write these songs from their experiences. you understand how they feel, and they sometimes even teach you things. teeny-boppers like the band because they think the members are hot, or sexy, but a lot of us like them for their music. so ppl, like good charlotte for their music, not just becuase the band memebers may be hot, or because they're under the category punk-rock."
2,Horribly Uncreative,"What ever happened to good guitarists? I'd much prefer to Zeppelin, Hendrix, Guns N Roses, or someone who knows how to make a decent song. My first problem is, all their songs sound so similar! It's like they're following a formula. Throw in a different song to mix it up a bit, please!! And the songs are just so simple. Somewhere out there, Clapton and Page are waiting to hear more than two or three chords. Honestly, singing to a few simple chord takes very little talent. Now, I admit, there are a few songs, (such as Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous) that actually are pretty catchy. Not great or anything, like White Room or Free Bird, but good enough to move this up to a two stars. I don't care for their singer's voice that much. The bassist isn't bad, but just playing roots or the melody isn't that good, either. Nice drumming, though."
1,Bad Charlotte is more like it,"Oh boy, oh boy! Another bland MTV-friendly poppy ""yo-yo-we're-sooo-punk-dawg"" album for your little sister to ""rock out"" to on the bus! Spare me. Hey, I admit I like some pop-punk as long as it's catchy (IE: Blink 182, Simple Plan, the Ataris), but this isn't even remotely memorable. This album makes rich preppy chearleaders think they're punk rock. This should not continue. The fact that the one ""guy"" is wearing a Casualties shirt is just plain flat out sacrilege. Seriously, everybody, just buy the entire Green Day collection, and I guarantee you'll be MUUUUCH happier.If you like this album, than the title describes you quite well."
2,Rap punk?!??! Say it aint so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These geeks should have also been in the grouping of all the other mall punk bands, but deserved a smidge more attention for subjecting us to their ""rock show"" on mtv... strangely enough, a show that had nothing rock n' roll about it whatsoever. Way to go dudes, talking about Nofx in between playing Disturbed videos lit our world on fire. 11 year olds in Nebrahoma are hanging onto every word these morons are saying, thus sealing their cute and cuddly mall punk destinies. These clowns make Sum 41 look like Black Flag."
5,Talkin about whining?,"If u call them whining &always complaining u gotta listen to Eminem. And I admit people over 40 might not like GC becoz they won't be able to take it. GC's first album wasn't too good b'coz it WAS much like pop but this one is SO totally different. Untill now,I've only found 4 albums out of 50 I own that are really worth having, and this one places second.Most cds u'll get tired of after listening for more than a week but not this one.The only song I don't like's Girls & Boys."
5,good charlotte rocks,"I LOVE THIS CD! this is my favorite cd ever...i used to not like punk rock now i love it, good charlotte is the best band ever, every single song on the cd is awesome, u won't get sick of it its definitly worth ur [money]!! i loved it, goodcharlotte.com and goodcharlotterocks.com r they best sites for gc, trust me soon ull be obsessed...there so cool, cute, great @ music...luv tha lyrics BEST CD EVA U GOTTA GET IT!!! ;) ;) i luv gc"
4,Good Charlotte,i enjoyed this cd very much. it is different from their first album. it comes down to a more personal level which i thought was very kewl. but it brings about a whole new gc and let everyone know that they aren't just little kids they're on their way to being huge!
5,An album you won't want to stop listening to,"From the instrumental ""A New Beginning"" to ""Movin' On"", there isn't a bad song. Just try not to dance when ""Another Loser Anthem"" or ""Riot Girl"" comes on. ""Day That I Die"" is the catchiest song I've ever heard. ""Hold On"" and ""Emotionless"" are amazing. It's nice to hear an album that isn't packed full of unrequited love songs.Aside from the great songs on this album, there is a live footage of the band just being normal guys.Although Good Charlotte's first album is still my favorite, I highly suggest this album."
3,A little balance...,"So, having read some of the other reviews... First off, Good Charlotte is a good band. They aren't a super great band, probably not as good as many (Green Day, etc.) They aren't a straight punk band like the Ramones or anything like that, and maybe they try to be a little more punk than they actually are. BUT they are a pop punk band. (like Simple Plan or Blink 182 nowadays), which may not be as cool as older, truer punk, but it's still cool because their music is fun. It might not have the depth or edge of other bands, but you can't help singing along with it. They could still use some getting over high school (they're what, in their mid-20's?) but this cd is way better than their first one, so if you want Good Charlotte, go for it."
2,Not the best.....it's aight tho....,"If you want the best of GC, czech out their earlier stuff. This CD tho, is what proves that Good Charlotte has majorly sold out. I give this CD 2 stars for 'Hold On', because it is a beautiful song, and the vid is very touching. But other than that it's so...blah!!! i prefer Simple Plan's ""No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls 10x to this. Same with ""Sing The Sorrow"" by AFI. czech those 2 out!!! You'll love them far better than this over-rated crappola!!!!~*~Matt~*~"
5,The most punk band on MTV,"Good Charlotte released the best mainstream Punk CD this year. Everyone knows who they are now, and they deserve the attention they are getting. These guys don't sit there and whine about girls, these guys talk about important things. We need groups like Rancid and Bad Religion up there as well so Good Charlotte will have some company. This is much better than their first CD and deserves a 5 star rating. They also have a really positive message. Best songs are The Anthem, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, My Bloody Valentine, and The Young and Hopeless. You must buy this now!"
5,Just a great CD,"Not a lot of fuss, but just a solid CD with a lot of great songs -- tunes and lyrics alike."
1,NOT AGAIN!!,IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS ALBUM(IF YOU COULD CALL IT ONE) NEGATIVE STARS!! AND TO ANYONE WHO LIKES GOOD CHARLOTTE HEAR THIS.......GOOD CHARLOTTE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!
1,Punk is definitely dead.... R.I.P.,"Ok girls and boys. Punk died a long time ago. Good Charlotte are pretty much the NSYNC of the post punk era. C'mon punk was never ever supposed to be anything like this. If you are ""punk"" nowadays you are trying to create a new sound not rehash some old formula to the pop masses. Get real. Go buy a record by the Adolescents, the Germs, Black Flag ""Jealous Again"", Agent Orange, D.I., 45 Grave, early T.S.O.L., the Circle Jerks, ect. That was punk. they sold about 500 hundred records and played serious dives. Not like the Good Charlotte ""cash in punks"". Punk is definitely dead. They should even pretend otherwise. If anything this is a new genre ""Pop-Punk"". C'mon good charlotte, Halloween is over."
1,Horrible,"Worst thing i have ever heard. GC is putting the nail in punks coffin. They are terrible pop band ruining music. This is the exact same thing as Avril,NFG,(both horrible)and many others. As far as this album goes, if u like pop music you will probably like this. This is the band that all the pop kids can like and say there punks. DO NOT BUT THIS ALBUM. I hope this pop-punk thing will fade fast."
4,"Sure, it's different, but it's still good","This CD is a bit of a change from the last Good Charlotte CD (self titled, 2000) but a GC fan will most likely still like it. It has a bit of a harder sound, with less traces of the hip-hop influence evident in the last album. Some of the songs, like ""Boys and Girls"" and ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"", have slightly juvenille and pointless lyrics, however, ""Boys and Girls"" with it's hip 80s sound is still kind of fun to listen to, and ""Lifestyles"" is getting good radio play. However, in my opinion, those are the two worst on the CD. They are not the greatest example of what GC is capable of. The other songs are much better, however, as you've probably heard before, you haven't heard GC until you've heard GC live. But, this CD does give a pretty good taste of the essense that is Good Charlotte."
4,Young and Hopeless,"When I first listened to the CD, I was a bit disappointed, I thought It paled in comparision to the self entitled cd they first released, but as I listened to it more and more, I found myself liking the CD more and more. Now that I have listened to the cd a dozen or so times, I think it's on par with the first one the released. GC fans this is what you were all waiting for. This CD will definantley bring new fans on the GC bandwagon. My favorite songs are my bloody valentine and the anthem but all the songs on this cd will have you singing along to them after you listen to the cd a few times!"
1,"punk image, pop sound - wtf","What a bunch of hacks. They put on their punk makeup, spike their hair, put on their punk clothes, thrash around and break stuff when making music videos, and they soud like pop superstars. This band is a perfect example of the facades the music industry is capable of selling. Want pop music? Buy this album, no doubt. I don't want to dissaude you from buying the album if it's music you like, but don't look at the band and say, wow they look pretty badass, they must sound badass too. They are just another of the thousands of blink knockoffs, but if that's what you like, go for it."
1,IM MORE PUNK THAN YOU ARE! I SHOP AT HOT TOPIC!,"Im sorry, but this album is not that great.....at all. I mean they're decked out in their Hot Topic gear, so they must be ""punk"". All they do is piss and moan about their problems and what is eevn sadder, is the fact that this type of music appeals to people. This type of music comepletely and utterly distorts what ""punk"" music is. Unless ""punk"" music is about being rich, making more money, being on MTV, and turning kids into ""punk"" poseurs by promoting Hot Topic, this is nothing close to ""punk"". This is just my opinion though, and im not trying to persuade anyone, im just sharing my opinions about this so-called ""band"" and this CD."
1,already heard 1'000 times ...,"... this is the title they could have given to this CD. I bought this CD because I was curious and after having listening to this CD only 2 times, I was already bored ....I'm not saying that the band is bad, but this kind of catchy punk-pop-rock song have been heard a million times !!! There's nothing original on this CD, sorry to say that ... But if you're a big fan of Blink 182, Sum 41 etc ..., this CD is for you. But if you're looking for something original, don't buy this album, maybe have a listen to ""From Autumn to Ashes"", ""Hell is for Heroes"" or ""Atreyu"".Peace"
4,This CD is a winner!,"This CD is Good Charlotte's second one and it's so awesome that i just had to write a review! If you ever turn on the radio, then you've obviously heard this CD's first single, Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous. But that's not the best song on the CD. Other awesome songs are The Anthem, which is soo good, Wondering, Girls & Boys, and lots of other great songs. If you don't have this CD, you should definetley get it!"
5,Keep it playing,"I'm really into music, but I'm pretty picky tho. But wow! The Young and the Hopeless is a greatttt CD. I've listened to the whole CD straight threw like 5 times and thats a lot for a CD. I've even listend to it when I'm working out. It's great for if you wanna get pumped or get emotions out or just to listen to. Who gives a crap wether who thinks it punk or not.. w/e I mean who ever says that is obviously an ignoranous or jus listens to music cuz he or she is a poser and wants to stand out cus their rebelling against Good Charlotte. Let me tell you something get a life. Have u ever heard the saying if u dont have nething nice to say dont say it all. yah well that applies to all u haters. But bak to the point Benj or Joel dont sound like lil boys .. they have really diff unique voices unlike most artists today.. if u have an ear for music ull like this stuff trust me."
1,why don't we just surrender the term punk to the big three?,"why don't we just surrender the term punk to the big three record companies? f--- it, man, they can have it, they've already s--- on it enough with toxic waste dumps such as this? seriously, we can just decide punk means retread poorly carfted pop songs for fourteen year old girls. we can call our music like something cool, like ""anti-mersh rock"" or ""corporate ceo's give good ---- music"".....anyway, i've seen these ----ers coming from miles away, meandering around as huge cancerous posers on a dying late 90's scene, it took em long enough to get enough funding from universal to fully sellout. by the way, nice job having a song called my bloody valentine, not only a tired overdone subject but also being blissfully unaware the name of a key band in the ""alternative"" movement which has allowed you to cash in.....this just makes me sick, man...that's pretty eyeliner and a sweet new skateboard tee, bro."
2,Good Charlotte.. punk? I think not.,"You can call Good Charlotte's music anything you want, but just because they dress like they do, does not make them ""punk."" The fact of the matter is, they make pop music in order to get mass air time on radio, the mtv, what have you. that is not punk.Good Charlotte makes songs that get huge amounts of play, they make videos for half the songs on their cds.. yeah, they're bringing in the bucks. Yet they sing songs like ""Lifestyles of the rich and famous,"" which criticizes rich people. A little contradicting...It's like Avril Lavigne dressing ""punk"" in the video where she sings the really, really, really soft song, ""I'm with you."" It doesn't matter really... if you like the music, listen to it. I just think this is another example of a band that has changed its music in order to get more money. Their first CD was decent- this one is just pop so more young kids will listen. Take away the instruments and they're a boy band. The tattoos and spiked hair are just acts."
5,Good Charlotte Rocks,"Good charlotte gives us another great cd to listen to. The cd is full of songs that u will love. You cant hate any of them its to hard. With their first single off the new cd being lifestyles of the rich and famous, you no the cd will be huge. you will probably be able to relate to most of the songs on the cd. this is a great cd and if ur not sure about buying it-u should!! you probably wont regret it @ all. Make sure u check out the songs girls and boys (#6), riot girl (#9) and The daay that i die (#11)those are just my 3 favorite b/c all of the sons are great!"
1,Yeah i agree with the music fan from Massachusetts,"Well looking at this horirble album I saw a review saying that GC was more Talented then LP for the record i also hate linkin park and good charlotte and that there both sell outs. Yet for the record Linkin Park is way more talented then good charlotte. There guitar is extremly simple, bass is failry easy, and the drums are even easier. Like that one dude said from Massachusetts, LInkin Park is session muscians and all of them went to college on the study of music and got a degree on music, now as I recall Good Charlotte once said these lines Go to college,A university Get a real job""That's what they said to me Lyrics form the Anthem as we can all see Good charlotte didnt even take hte time to got o college and get an education there just high school drop outs. f that one person that wrote that review saying Lp was less talented mayeb you should look more into music before you say someting."
1,We all make mistakes,"Well i am onee of those people that bought this cd the day it came out hoping for somehting decent but i got terrible. See the probelm with this band is how much they changed there music from past relases. But for the many of you who really dont kno this band used ot be DEATH METAL,\take a deep breath yes death metal, but why the change in there music. Well the record company paid them loads of money to make pop=punk and of course the band did it. The band dosn't even like the music they play anymore and they only do it for the money get it threw your head you poser kids, get any real punk i dont kno maybe Sex Pistols, and possible some clash. But no a a band as horrible as Good Charlotte can do this, to all you kids who think you know everything about good charlotte well guess what your really wrong, get real music not this garbage."
1,terrible,"Good Charlotte is one of the worst bands out now. They are the same as every other band like simple plan, all american rejects, and newfound glory. This ""pop-punk"" genre is boring and over done. The guitarists and drummer in this band have no talent whatsoever, and the whiny lyrics will get on your nerves quickly. Rock and roll needs something new, not the same band over and over with different people like all these pop bands. If you want real music listen to CKY, or if you want good punk music listen to anti-flag or some old blink 182 cd's. steer clear or this terrible album."
1,boring....,"THEY ARE NOT POSERS BECUZ IN ONE OF THERE SONGS IT SAYS I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE YOU AND THAT IS WHY THEY LOOK DIFFERENT. SOME OF THE OTHER SONGS TALK ABOUT THERE DAD AND HOW HE LEFT THEM.-some other reviewerThat is definitely one of the most ineffective arguments i've ever heard. People can say anything, but they don't have to mean it. I gave this album one star because I really don't like the music. FIrst of all, its quite repetitive. Most of the songs sound similar except a few of the softer ones. I listened to this album because I heard it was good and I thought that ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" was pretty good. But when I listened to the album, all I found were a bunch of boring songs with mundane whiny lyrics, simplistic song structures and bad musicianship. That is my opinion on this album. If you like Simple Plan and the like you would probably enjoy this album throughly. But if you consider yourself a true punk then this CD would quite possibly make you angry."
1,...,"This album is horrid. First of all, is has the worst and most vulgar rhymes that anyone could of thought imaginable. The fact that they are rich and famous makes that song nothing more then a hypocritical statement. As far as I see it, this is the new age of pop. This is pop, gone a slight darker. Marilyn Manson is someone who I would advise all of you teeny-poppers to look into. Hehe, I read how you hate being called that and say you aren't, so I'm going to say it again. Teenyboppers, hehe."
1,Lifestyles of the future broke kids,"Trust me! You really dont wanna support this piece of crap. Every songs sound the same. They sing about the same old highschool is horrible stuff. It really couldnt get any sadder when i saw gc on tv and i see girls age of 10-12 dying their hair blue or green just to look cool and feel like they deserve to be credited as ""punk"". So anyone gotta gun so i can shoot these wankers?"
1,All this is good for is a coaster,"I don't have the words to describe the awfulness of good charlotte. I don't give a damn about any of that ""they aren't punk bull"" because that doesn't matter. They are just a very untalented band. If 4 people picked up an instrument for the first time and played for a year, they would be able to write better songs and lyrics then these a$$holes. Its not too hard to write songs that will relate to depressed teens, but if you're gonna do it, why not write some actual intelligent lyrics. A monkey could write more intellgent lyrics about its love for bananas. While Britney Spears is the cancer of the music industry, Good Charlotte is the gonorrhea."
1,...,"I find it ironic in Bad Charlotte's ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" that they talk about the famous people complaining, when they're the ones complaining. It's like this whole pot-in-the-kettle thing.In the song ""Say Anything"" the lyrics are ""Don't say a word / I know you feel the same / Just give me a sign / Say anything Say anything."" It doesn't make sense to me why you would say ""don't say a word,"" and then command, ""say anything!""I guess these days you don't need to have good grammar or possess common sense to get into the music industry.This so-called 'punk' garbage won't quit polluting the airwaves. Punk music must die, or the old punk music should come back. When will this end?"
1,This is not punk,"Don't let MTV and Z100 fool you. This is not punk, its not even close. If you want to find out what punk truely is then go no further than these three exellent bands - The Ramones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols. They godfathers of punk and when you compare, this does not even come close"
5,Silly little punk crybabies,"OK--- So, all these so-called ""Punk Aficionados"" Call GC Sell outs-- non- punk and saying that punk bands want to change the world is silly, Punk in a sense is just a lifestyle, and shouldn't be taken so seriously as to, claim bands have sold out, Who cares! Honestly, if they're punk, Nsunk, or whatever, oh well. They are the best that's been around in a long time, and they who cares what their fans want to call them--- Just lay off such a good band as Good Charlotte, and focus on your own little lives. P.S. Punkers are the least likely to want to change the world!"
3,ok...,"I've been a fan of Good Charlotte for 4 yrs now and I bought their first CD when it came out. When I first heard that CD, I thought it was one of the best I've ever heard. So, thinking The Young and Hopeless would be as good as their last, I went out and bought it. BIG mistake. This is a really bad CD from a really good band. There are about 3 good songs on this cd. My advice is buy their first one instead. This CD is a real disapointment."
3,meh... only thought in mind right now...meh...,"before this CD came out, before lifestyles was on TRL, before people actually knew good charlotte, i used to be a huge GC fan, i listened to the 1st cd over and over and over again (I still do ^^) but i have to say that I've been desappointed in this new album, most of all the songs are teenie bopper pop punk, most of all the songs don't differ from one another, the song boys & girls is just... stupid... but don't get me wrong, songs like emotionless, the story of my old man, hold on, and the anthem are the best songs in this album, but if I were you I wouldn't buy it, just download the songs you like and thats it... and by the way for another future reference, good charlotte is NOT a punk band!!! if you want to listen to real punk listen to the sex pistols, the clash, rancid.. etc.. I'll shut up now ^___^"
2,Are you kidding me?,"You people are ridiculous. You call this punk music? I can tell you one thing, they dont play real punk or any real music for that matter on TRL. You are all just following a new trend in which you think it is cool to act hardcore because that is the direction that MTV is taking. I am sick of reading reviews by 12 year olds about albums like this saying how they are truly punk music and its great to get away from Nsync, Britney Spears, etc. You teenie boppers are getting to a point that is unbearable and your insidious comments such as those below are just a reflection of how ignorant you truly are. Perhaps you enjoy this cd, thats fine, but please do not try to tell me and others that this is the ""hardcore"" music that has changed your lives and made you trade in all of your britney spears cds. And please dont be mad at my review, you will like a new group and/or music type by next month anyway."
1,Let's try this...,"If you think Good Charlotte sucks ass and bands like The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Misfits(Danzig) are awesome click ""yes"".If you think Good Charlotte is ""da freekin bestest pank band eva!!!!!"" and you think The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Misfits(Danzig) suck click ""no"".I wonder what this will turn out like..."
5,A must have,"I think this is by far the bands best effort to date, its just one of those cds that you can listen to every track. Its a got a little bit of everything and the songs may sound like rip offs of other band styles its more of a tribute to the bands that lead them to this point. The sound is different throughout the cd, the songs dont all sound the same like some bands seem to do these days.Overall its just a fun time whenever you rock this album."
1,Dont Get It,Is this a Blink 182 cover band or is this Good Charlotte? Maybe they dont deserve 1 star but i just cant stand the 'dress like punk but sing pop songs way of making music'... And man I wish MTV would stop playing them every 10 minutes...
1,DUDEBRO ITS PUNKRAWK,"WOWOWOW GOOD CHARLOTTE R THE MOST AMAZING PUNKRAWK BAND LIKE EVER CUZ THEY R SO COOL. WHEN I HEAR LIFESTYLE OF RICH AND FAMOUS I THINK I AGREE WITH THEM BECAUZE THEY R NOT FAMOUS OR RICH AND THEY MAKE FUN OF WHO IS RICH AND FAMOUS LIKE STUPID NELLY I HATE RAP! ANYWAY THIS IS FOR FANS OF HOT BANDS LIKE SIMPLE PLAN MEST BOXCARRACER BLINK 182 AVRIL LAVIGNE OH MAN. BEST CD EVER.just kidding, this is really terrible, hence the 1 star rating."
2,"The Guitarist SUCKS, people!","HAHAHAHAHA! This guitarist sucks. Even if the songs stick in your heads, the band sucks. KoRn Sucks. HaHaHaHaHa!"
2,"Hopless definatly not, but young... maybe","When i waste my catch on this i thought i was going to get slammed, slammed by these mothers, but it turned out this cd just stank very bad... jest gooder trash, nothing new, but trash, and anyway BenGee dressing lick a goaths not even acting lick punk, anyway this cd is weres than God Charolette's cd ""The Young And Hopeless"" and what cud be weres?? Dont buy tish trash... if you want trash get it from the landfill... not from my garbage... the cd sounds like i dont know what she talking about. They think there bed ess, you think of beds? its worse! traoust me! and and another anding fool... its joust foolish to waste your cach on this stash or horror songs. They are hopless bed indied! Not worth it, makes me cry... The guitar cant even sing! and the voice is plaud horrifing... dont buy it under less you want my trash... know treasure found under this waste of chach... i give thow cd 2 stairs becuz i hope one day Bendgee will die... just cry, FAKE!"
1,Major label punk is an oxymoron,"I was forced to listen to this while on a car ride with a friend, and although it wasn't the worst thing I've ever heard, I can certainly understand why there are well over a hundred of these CDs for sale under the used catagory...it's because it stinks! I can't believe anyone would classify this as 'punk', it's simply trendy commercial crap. Today - the hot new trend, tomorrow - in the used CD bin for $1."
1,how could anyone like them???,Maybe I would begin to respect them if they didn't cry and complain about them same old thing in every song! bo hoo I dont fit in or even worse they complain about people who complain. that just makes to much sense doesn't it.
3,I guess good,"Good Charlotte was a good band when they first came out, but there latest cd does deserve them to be called posers! There lyrics may not be all hardcore deep and stuff but there are some catchy songs that you'll find singing for the rest of the week. I wouldn't say this band is your regular punk rock like pennywise, misfits, sex pistols etc but it is todays punk rock wheither people like it or not. I wouldn't recommend buying this cd but maybe some other bands like Yellowcard, The Used, Sugercult, The All American rejects, Simple Plan, My Chemical Romance, Blink 182, Story of the Year, New found Glory, Green Day, Fall out boy and The Starting Line. I don't know maybe get into some death metal or black metal whatever! A long as you to rock because thats the good music!"
5,Just as good as the first cd,I pre-ordered the cd for about 14 bucks and it was well worth the money (14 bucks is a lot for me). 'The Young and the Hopeless' is one of the best albums I have ever heard. And most of the songs are really uplifting.
5,The Young And Hopeless,"Well, i'm a huge fan of punk rock. As of the last few years, true punk rock has been hard to find. Most punk bands start punk and become what I call sell-outs, where they become famous and their music goes down the drain. Good Charlotte although, has impressed me greatly. I think it's awesome. I became a huge fan of Good Charlotte when they released a video for Little Things. I was in a rush to go out and buy the slef titled album. Some time passed and Good Charlotte has finally released a new album, which i'm totally in love with. Good Charlotte is a definition of punk. Frontmen Benji and Joel are what keeps the band alive. Young And Hopeless helps keeps true punk alive. The album is awesome, kicks off with A New Beginning and keeps rocking all the way through the end with Movin On. If you're a person seeking true punk, then this is the album for you! It's GC baby!"
2,Posers,"Good charlotte isn't origanal. They are just posers. If you like real punk listen to blink 182, Mxpx,green day and homegrown. These bands inspired Good Charlotte they have better music and have better mosh pits at thier concerts."
5,Madd Krazy!,"If you need a little fun, hope,excitment, something...this cd is what you need. Its your first aid kit to life ..YOU WILL LOVE it! Its awesome!! trust me! buy it .. it rocks!!"
1,...,"All Good Charlotte can do is make me laugh. And then cry. Their lyrics are, most times, childish at best. And it makes me sick every time I here ""lifestyles..."" simply because they have no room to speak. If they think rich people complain so much, then maybe they should give all of their profit to some form of charity and give up their land rovers. Not only is this NOT punk, but a bad example for kids searching for actual punk music. It only fuels the fire of recent trend."
1,What up with CRAP today???,"I don't know what has happened to true rockers. It seems that now, ""Rockstars"" are all catchy tunes. THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE LEAST ROCKIN' THINGS OUT THERE!!! What happened to what Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, ACDC, Jimi Hendrix, and all other classic rock sensations created. They gave us a gift...A gift of true meaning...and we destroyed it. Rock is slowly dieing (excuse my spelling). Those true rockers that remain are the only hope for the gift that is ROCK.So please, do not get this album, the tunes are annoying after the first time and their skills very, vary low. Ignore this and get yourself some Sabbath, Zeppelin, Hendrix, or Credence, NOT THIS!!!"
5,GC is at it once again!,"Good Charlotte Rocks...and they've proved this once again with their new cd ""The Young and The Hopeless."" The group is amazing on this album, as they are on others, but add much more of a emotional touch to this effort as opposed to others. Still Joel, Benji, Billy and Paul never cease to amaze me and they crank up the heat yet again...i havent stopped listening since i bought the cd on october 1."
5,Definitly pick this up!,"The Good Charlotte CD is so great! All the tracks are heartfelt and real, as opposed to other ""punk"" bands that arent. This is definitly worth your money and you should pick it up immediately."
5,Great Album!!,"The new Good Charlotte album is a must have. You can tell the band ahs grown alot over the past couple of years. This album has a little different sound, but just as great as the first!!!"
2,"Yes, I HAVE listened to the album","So there you go I'm not just here to diss the band.I bought this album 3 years ago (long story lots of regrets) and let me just say, if you're thinking about buying it: SAVE YOUR MONEY. The guitars are cheesy and the lyrics are bland and very uninspired. I wouldn't be suprised if they wrote all these songs in the same night. It's just gross"
3,An occasional cd,This is just a fun cd to throw on. There is one song in particular that i really enjoyed which is Hold on. This is about the strongest song on this cd. There arent many songs on this cd that have such a deep message. This cd will be enjoyable for 13 year olds and it can occasionally be thrown in the stereo of anyone who is up to the age of 18---anyone older do not buy the cd------> i do recommend everyone buy their latest Chronicles of LIfe and Death CD-huge upgrade
4,Pretty Good...,"-This is Heather's teenage son :P-This album is a very good/fun one to listen to. I DO agree that they are definately NOT punk, more pop-ish, but I'm not going to go on and on bashing the genre. I like this CD. Sure, one of their songs make them seem like hypocrits but it was still a good song...The best songs would be these...1. Hold On2. Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous3. Riot Girl4. The Young and the Hopeless...but those are my personal opinions. If you don't like them, fine. But don't go bashing other people for liking the band.Good Charlotte rox. X-D"
2,Mediocre at best...,"If you really want some good pop/punk I would recommend the following: Fall Out Boy, Bayside, Matchbook Romance, Hey Mercedes, and/or Sugarcult... Save your money and listen to Top 40 radio if you want to hear GC..."
2,"Good golly gosh, Batman!","Now, I'm a fan of many types of rock. Pop-punk has a little niche in my musical listening. But Good Charlotte? Oh joy. These ""musicians"" are not deserving of the attention that they get, whether it is good praise or ""real punk fans"" saying ""This sucks!"" I have to side with the latter. This CD, while having a good song (Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous), is full of simple guitar riffs, horrible lyrics (I'm troublesome, I'm falling, I'm angry at my father), and overall poppy, preppy songs. They sing about being misfits, not being a part of society, and troubles that teens go through. Honestly, I don't think they ever were teenagers."
1,You are all being brainwashed.,"Holy Friggen Crap!!! This is probably the worst album ever. Not only do they consider it pop-punk when its as unpunk as possible, but hundreds of kids are buying into this whole ""punk fashion"" thing and I'M SICK OF IT! How much crap do punks need. The media looks at us as a threat, so they create a band that will make us follow their order. Message to all Good Charlotte fans: YOU ARE ALL POSERS! YOU WILL NEVER BE PUNKS! I DON'T CARE WHAT MTV AND ALL THOSE F**KING MEDIA JUNKIES SAY. BUY A VIRUS ALBUM AND THEN WE'LL TALK!!!!!"
1,Crap CD,"This album absolutely sucks. Whoever said that the leader singer could actually sing must have been deaf or something. The songs on the cd are pointless, shallow, and dull. This album is full of teeny-bopper pop songs disguised as rock.Don't waste your money on this garbage, cuz that's where it belongs."
5,Good Charlotte,This Cd is one of the best ive heard in a while and shows how much they've grown since their last cd which they said about them selves. I personaly listend to the hole cd about 90 times or more since ive gotten it and again its a really good cd and if you haven't bought it areadly do and if you have buy a second...
5,"No where near ""good"" their grrrrrreat!!!","If you are need for a brand new CD that will rock your world....Then you need to buy Good Charlotte's, The Young and the Hopeless!!! It rocks! There's nothing better out there and never will be!!! It is excellent and I totally recommend it!!!!!It's so upbeat and they've never sounded better! I bought this after falling in love with there first CD!! And continiuosly seeing benji and Joel on all things rock on MTV! ROCK ON GC!!!!! Benji, Joel, Billy, and Paul tear it up on this brand new CD. It's so alive and full of real punk music. If you thought their debut CD was good you have to pick this one up as soon as possible it will blow you away!"
5,The Young and Hopeless,"This album is by far the best I've heard. Good Charlotte has mature so much, and is easily noticed in their new album. I think everyone should go out and buy it right away. Every song rocks."
1,LYKE OH MA GOD!,"LYKE OH MA GOD! Good Charlotte so rock! They are lyke so cute and stuff with their spiky hair, tattoos, and guitars. They are lyke so badass people! I lyke used to lyke listen to nsync and stuff and now i dont because lyke all my friends listen to punk like Good Charlotte because they're on trl! Oh ma god benji is so cute like a teddy bear. If you dont lyke have this album lyke get it ok! They sing about girls and boys, thats like soooo punk!What you have just seen above is an example of Good Charlotte's fans. This band is a joke. Avoid at all costs."
2,*sigh*,"Well, I have to say that I am saddened by this album. GC is relying way to much on the way people lable each other to market their music. I've seen way to many ""punk"" , ""preppies"" and ""posers"" in these reviews. When GC first came out, they were normal people. Yes, Benji had his tatoos and such, but nothing was nearly as milked as it is now. Now, bands like NFG and GC rely to much on the whole ""punk"" look and ""lifestyle""(no pun intended). No one seems to see that the music that they all play isn't ""punk"", it's just ""rock n roll"". Power chords and a nice drumbeat with a little acoustic ballad or so. And if you like it, more power to you, but I see it as way to generic. If you like music that is catchy and kind of repetative, with some meaningful lyrics, then go for it. If you want something with a little more originality and some very thought provoking lyrics, then go for Radiohead - The Bends, or At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command. And Green Day is always good."
1,AWFUL,This is absolutely awful just horrible music the worst band ever. They are such sell outs they think gthey are punk i cant even begin to describe how bad this band is im so mad that people actaully consider this music LISTEN to it its a bubble gum sugar coated hardcore brittny spears with tattoos and piercings. BAd charlotte is what they should be named they are just God awful
5,The Young and Hopeless,I think that this c.d. was an awesome it was a great follow up to theie their last c.d. Thair are some awesome songe on thair and i rilly think u should go and buy the cd right now. You get a lot moor then just the c.d. u get a lot of c.d. extras!!!
4,The Young and Hopeless,"Good Charlotter has amazed us once again with this great new CD, The Young and Hopeless. As most of you know, a track from their CD, Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous, has already made it to numder 1 on TRL. And by the way things are looking, it will stay there for a while.In my opinion, this cd is great. Benji opens the CD with a great piece about how they dont want to be famous, but they do it for good music. ""Hold On"", ""Emotionless"", and ""The Day I Die"", to me, are some of the best songs on the CD. But you will have to figure it out for yourself what songs you like the best, and get this awesome CD. If you like punk/rock, you will love this CD"
3,Get over yourselves,"You know what I find funny?How people are arguing back and forth about why this CD rocks/sucks, when it's more than 3 years old.Come on people. Grow up. Some people like it, some people don't. Let's be respectful.Personally, I enjoyed the CD, back in 2002. And I admit, it still has some good songs. No, they're not the best band ever. No they're not punk. But who really cares anyway? If you're that offended that someone classifies them as punk, then maybe you ought to re-examine what's really important in your life.Whatever. I'm going to bed."
1,Oh here we go....,"Okay...people. Let me just get this though to you. GOOD CHARLOTTE IS NOT...I REPEAT NOT PUNK. Most of you think they are...but you are decived by these ""pretty"" boys. Just because they don't dress the same as other people, doesn't mean their punk. Punk is an attitude...not a dress code. I want you to do this if you don't belive me, listen to their lyrics...and picture a boy band singing. I think you'll understand then. But if you like them, then hey,like them. But please don't classify them as punk rock. Punk rock bands are bands like The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The New York dolls, The Damned...etc. And the reason you don't hear about them is..because they fought agesnt being popular and agenst the goverment..and agenst a lot of the pop music we see today. Now that's the punk attitude."
3,Listen up all you wanna be critics!,"For all of you who think that Good Charlotte is a sellout I have some news for you. Just because a band has two songs that happens to grab everyones attention, doesn't make a band a sellout. It just makes them an even greater band for being able to pull in more fans. It's not Good Charlotte's fault that the radio industry has taken their music and played it along with the poppy hits of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. I have to say that this cd has a decent compilation of tracks. I do find it to my liking. If you are a fan of thier older cd, the self titled ""Good Charlotte""(5 stars) (which I can not find one bad thing to say about it), then I recommend you buy this cd."
1,Garbage,"This album is a terribile ..., it is not punk. I have listened to the entire album not only do all the songs sound the same they all are bad. This album is a waste of time and money. On another note benji dosnt really know how to play guitar hes a mascot for the band."
5,GC ROX!,"I love GC! Whoever said that their Nsync w/ guitars- do you really think Nsync could write such great songs as Emotionless or Moving On- oh wait! they don't write their songs! and they don't play instruments! Thay are POP! GC is pop-punk, which I guess means that it has some punk influence, and also catchy beats. That's a GOOD thing. And also, before the GC craze, the pop fanatics would have said- ""punk? ew!"" but is it really such a bad thing that GC is mainstream? They have fabulous songs! I love Riot Girl, Wondering, Bloody Valentine- well everything!This CD rox! So does Good Charlotte! Please get this CD and th first one as well! Peace out!"
1,Poison,"It is stupid beatless ""Ya Ya Ya I am a cool poser!"" and it inspires skateboarding and that is th dumbest thing ever skateboarding is for losers screw it"
1,Burn this CD.,"By burn, I mean with a fire. This is not even remotely punk. The only punk band today that exists today is the descendents. They started pop/punk (along with the buzzcocks and a few others) and are 100 times better than these dolts. I don't own this CD. Anymore."
5,GC kicks bum,"alrite I just recently fell in love with ""good charlotte type"" music and I just think this is a great CD to start out with... theres some things I can relate to and some things that I cant but it kind of shows me how hard life can be for some people and I realize I take stuff for granted all the time... I think everyone should listen to this CD and see what they think... I am definetly gonna start listning to more ""punk rock"" if thats what we're calling this now and I look forward to hearing GC stuff in the future!"
4,not posers,"GC's sophomore album doesn't quite measure up to the first CD but it's good nonetheless... ""My Bloody Valentine"" really stands out as my personal favorite, it's a sweet song about desperate love. ""Emotionless"" is another good one, very depressing, a song in the form of a letter to Benji and Joel's father (who walked out on the family when they were kids). Yeah, they don't dress the part of their pop-punky music, but who cares? At least they know how to play their instruments (unlike a certain poser who claims that because she wears ties, her music is sooooo punk rawk!)"
1,huh?,"this type of music makes me sad. i could go to a side stage grab an acoustic guitar, or hell, do acapella and have better music then these guys. Why? because these guys are ruining punk music - they wouldnt bother me half as much if people understood this wasnt punk and that it is just nsync with guitars and some more tattoos. if somehow anyone of you who likes good charlotte actually grow up - try out some real punk like pennywise or nofx. this is crap"
3,Blah,"The fact of the matter is, you shouldn't listen to a CD and compare it to the music genres of the society we have today. Most people tend to immediately categorize songs, as to whether it is punk/pop/metal, etc. That categorization isn't in my programming. Just take one song and listen to it, and decide whether the lyrics, vocals, music and everything else about it justify to what it has to say. Music is universal. A song is a song. People write from experience."
2,Talent to Burn,"Unlike their sister band A Simple Plan who have built their foundation on being hard working, honest and professional Good Charlotte sound like the type of band who really have it all. Why then does this album add up to such an unsatisfying listen?. Well Jim it all comes down to the old chesnut of song stucture. Formulaic would be positive praise for this album, you will yearn for the journey but Good Charlotte won't even let you outside. Why then is it so hard to give up on these guys?. Chemistry, plain and simple. These guys were born to play together much like Tool and The Sisters of Mercy in different genres. Be warned though sheer talent will not keep this skeptic around forever and future releases have failed to address this problem. Insert sigh."
2,Not as good as the first . . .,"Basically, this CD is pop. Good Charlotte has gone from being semi-rockish to pop. The only difference between Good Charlotte and the Backstreet Boys is that GC makes their own music (minus the drums because their drummer quit) and they write their own lyrics. If you thought this album would be harder and faster than their first one, it's not. The rock songs stop after track 3. The rest of the songs are mostly about Benji and Joel's dad leaving. ""The Young and The Hopeless"" should be dedicated to their dad because he's mentioned in a lot of the songs. I'm sorry to say that Good Charlotte is now an MTV pop band being played on TRL too many times. My advice: buy it if you're like a die-hard fan, but forget it if you liked their old stuff."
1,Wanna be punkers,"Good Charolette is the Blink182 of 2002. They arent really punk, they just think that they are. Many real punk bands such as Avail and NOFX make FUN of these ""punks"" even though Good Charolette weartheir clothes and at like they are friends of the bands. If you want ""punk"" go buy a Rancid CD, not this."
4,"Not the best, but still pretty good","When I first got this CD I really liked it, but a couple of weeks later I never listen to it. That's probably because it's a lot more 'poppy' than their other titles. Also, I got really fed up with Joel (lead singer) rambling on about how he had such a terrible home life and his dad left him, which comes up on about 5 different songs. The catchy songs keep this album from being just decent, but it's not their best work."
5,"Took a little while, but I LOVE IT!","At first when I popped in this CD, I had a little trouble getting into the grove of it. It was noticibly different from the first disc offered up. But over the course of a week or so it grew on me, and now I love it. It's constantly in my CD player in the car, and my girlfriend and I drive down the road singing along to all the words. Almost every track on here is catchy and well produced. Good Charlotte is evolving and purifying their sound, and I like it. Keep up the good work."
5,This album is the best......,"This is a very deep and fun album all at the same time,i highly recommend you buy this, you will not be disapointed....Good Charlotte is showing this world just what they have, they are very talented group."
5,Good Charlotte: A New Beginning,"The Young & The Hopeless is an excellent transition from their debut album. This album displays a variety of content in which the listener can relate with their own unique experiences. Joel shows new vocal strengths (ex. My Bloody Valentine) to better express himself. Benji diplays more elaborate guitar skills to harmonize with the lyrics (ex. Hey Dad). Billys' usually agressive rhythm has transcended into a more complex and melodic realm (ex. Hold On). Paul distinguishes his talent as a musician with the use of 9 bass guitars on this album (ex. The Day That I Die). Overall this album is inspiring, emotional, and motivating. The Young and The Hopeless is truely an worth while purchase."
1,One of the Worst CD's I've Heard in a Long Time,Anyone who was thinking about buying this CD needs to rethink it. The members of Good Charlotte are probably the biggest posers I've ever seen(next to Avril Lavigne) and need to rethink their their image before releasing pop songs like the ones on their latest album. When I first heard this album I almost threw up. Even for a pop artist these songs [stink]!! And then to realize that a band that labels themselves as punk is making songs like the ones on their CD! Do yourself a favor and save your money for a real band.
1,WOW THIS IS GREAT>>>>>>>NOT,"WOW, I've heard most songs on this CD and I dont like them that much, but i guess i could see people gettin used to them, but seriously these guys are not really punk, mayb the individual members of the band are, but the band together is very annoying. Lifestyles of the rich and famous, WOW good charolette is rich and famous, maybee we should rob them, you think, its not like no one knew who they were before this album came out,and at the time they were rich and famous, so they should shove it. i mean these guys should try singing about new stuff, like in boys and girls they just steroetype people, maybe they should take their opinions that are so cliche and cram em. I mean only nimrods think this [stuff] is origional. If you really like these guys get their older stuff. If you must."
2,"Annoying, derivative posturing by a sub-par band","Did anyone else notice that their song Girls and Boys is a total rip-off of Blur's song Girls & Boys? It's just sad. Good Charlotte has catchy, lightweight songs but they are too busy attempting to look cool to make any decent music."
1,Tripe,"This is pure, recycled tripe. Every song on the album has a sameness and it's all ""too"" familiar. It sounds like the regular ""pop punk"" ...stuff you're expecting to get. The writing is not intelligent (say, like a Saves the Day) or the songs catchy (say, like a MEST).There's nothing spectacular about it. ""The Young and Hopeless"" falls short on every attempt (much like the previous album) and ever song is predictable (like emotionless). Don't buy this. Buy real ""emotional"" music, like a Modest Mouse, or Built to Spill, but this might be too intelligent for your average Good Charlotte fan."
1,This Still Isn't Punk,"Can someone PLEASE take this out of the punk section? It's an insult to the genre and is just getting more angry reviews because of this. Stop confusing people by calling this punk. Good Charlotte should be called 'Pop Rocks', They fizzle and make some noise, but they end with a sticky, bad after-taste."
5,gc's new cd,"i think the new GC album is one of the best released this year. their new songs are fresh and entertaining, yet it is clear that they have not forgotten their roots, and the reasons why everyone loved GC in the first place. I loved their previous album, and didnt think the guys could do any better. Yet out they come with the new cd, and rock the socks off everyone...good job boys!"
5,Good Charlotte,This cd is definatly a step in the right direction for Good Charlotte. Every song reflects the hard work and dedication that was put into this cd. It's got everything a fan could hope for. The usual (yet well-done) songs of retaliation and hating all things popular. Emotional songs that deal with fans and personal issues. Even songs that come from poems! This cd rocks and is more then worth the time& money! I would recommend that you buy this cd!
5,kick butt CD,"dude you guys ""the young and the restless""...the new GC cd....it kicks major butt...its got some great songs on it...the radio FINALLY started playing Good Charlotte after this album came out...the most popular song is lifestyles of the rich and famous...but dont be fooled...thats not the only good song these guys worte ya know...they got a lot of others...so buy the CD and check it out....its pretty good!!!"
1,ANOTHER BAD REVIEW FROM ME,"I must right another bad review. I must say GC is the worst band on the face of the earth, they are an abomination. They can't even play their instruments that good, and I hate the whole idea behind the clothes. If they want to be liked, maybe they should wear normal clothes, but even then they wopuld suck. The reason they DO suck is mainly because of the darn vocals, I hate that whiney teenage angst voice. Go listen to some real music and leave GC behind."
1,Simply Awful.,"How could you possibly pass off these whiney little boys as 'punk'? the lyrics are mind-rot, the guitars sound the same on EVERY SONG, the vocals sound like 7 year olds on helium beginning to cry, and the most talented band member is the drummer. Let's be honest, how do these fools compare to the sex pistols? That's right, they don't. This is derivative garbage. You want punk? Then stay away. FAR away."
1,the real deal on punk music,"O.K. kids it's simple, any album you buy on CD now is NOT a punk album, no matter how punk rock you think Good Charlotte or Linkin Park is, YOU are not."
5,Young and The Hopeless,"This cd gets u motavated to rock and you have to love the twins they are just cuties, what's a band with out hot sounds and hot members? They are definetly number one in my cd collection."
5,Wicked,"To those people who think GC isn't punk: Does it really matter if they're punk or not? I mean, Jesus...nowadays why are people judging their music cuz of their looks. WHO CARES if they're not punk or if they are. It's the music that they produce that counts not their looks or their style. This CD rocks and it's an awesome CD to listen to when you're (angry) or just wanna listen to something fun. GC rocks for life"
3,What a pleasant surprise,"I despise seeing goodcharlotte on mtv all the time (as well as mtv in general), so I was quick to judge this album that was produced by the guy that produces other supposedly ""punk"" bands like third eye blind. However, tonight I saw them on Letterman and heard a song that really caught my ear (not the anthem or lifestyles). The young and the hopeless song was what I heard. I was hooked with it's tune as well as the bands energetic performance. Intrigued, I immediately gave the cd a listen and was amazed that I actually liked it. They lose a star for being tools of mtv and another star for ripping off a few catchy melodies that sound way too familiar, but overall I liked this album and am no longer going to talk bad about these guys. Their Social-Distortion-like sound is great and very contagious. Punk or not, this album is good!"
5,A great show of Maturity!!!,"The Young and the Hopeless shows how much GC has matured as a band over the past two years. This album gives you the experience of hearing GC live. It is full of songs that everyone can relate to from The Anthem to Hold On. How can you not love a CD that has a song such as Wondering, which you think is a wonderful song about love and turns out to be a song about a dogg. This CD rocks and so does Good Charlotte!!"
5,The Young and Hopeless,The Young and Hopeless is an awesome cd. You should check it out its punk. But not as loud as most. All the songs are really great. Good Charlotte Rocks!!!!
3,Not what i expected,"The new cd Good Charlotte has put out is not what I expected. In some ways its good and in some ways its bad. I expected this to be a harder cd than the last one and its not. They still have amazing songs like they did on their last cd but it's become more poppy that usual. The cd is still good and I like it a lot, don't get me wrong but the last cd they had was a lot better in my opinion. Yeah i know that they have matured and stuff from the last cd but I also think that this cd has mellowed out because they have a lot more MTV/TRL fans that don't like harder stuff so they had to appeal to the audience that they have now. Which isn't wrong they deserve all the success that they get cuz they are great guys and they're awesome musicians but the cd just isn't what I thought it would be. Good Charlotte is stil one of my favorite bands and they always will be!"
3,"Not the worst thing in the wordl, but gets really boring","When I bought this CD thanx to all my friends saying its the best thing in the world, I liked it. I liked the beat, some of the lyrics, but what I really want to know is why they call themsleves punk. No offense to GC but they sing most about love and all other problems. Punk is being independent and so on. So GC's style is definetly punk, but there music is not."
2,its not THAT bad,there are some good songs but the songs that arent good make me want to throw things.
1,"baah, baah, bad","this album is for sheeps. it is pure crap, i borrowed it and it stinks. i tried to give them credit, i cannot. it is too whiney, and it is ""for the kids."" it is for the whiney little psuedo punk kids who swear they are outcasts yet form little covens of no less than 10, this album is complete trash. stay away from it. it is psuedo-punk. it is brilliantly fixed to be psuedo-punk. garbage. you want something punk? listen to the misfits."
5,Finally they have been recognized,"I have been listening to Good Charlotte since their first cd came out. Good Charlotte deserves a chance, and I highly recommend listening to thier music. Unlike most punk bands this one can succeed without falling to the level of other bands where subjects consist of sex, drugs, violence, and destroying society. Good Charlotte should have been recognized earlier with some great material from their earlier album including; Waldorf Worldwide, Motivation Proclamation, Complicated, and Seasons. This album continues with where they left off with great songs like; Wondering, Say Anything, Hold On, Young and the Hopeless. If you have the chance listen to these songs and you will definately enjoy the cd."
1,Wannabe Punk Rockers...,"Good Charlotte are not a punk band. They may think that they are, and their many fans may think that they are, too. But I assure you, Good Charlotte are nothing but a bunch of wannabes. No different than Simple Plan. In case any of you think I actually wasted money on this CD, I didn't. I've only heard the singles (all of which are horrible), and the singles are all I need to hear to come to the conclusion that Good Charlotte is a poser band. If you want a decent punk band, go for Blink 182 or Green Day. These guys just suck...bad..."
1,All right,"All right. Let me attempt to explain what this is.People have been flaming this music, and then some have been loving this. There are some pretty solid facts, though.1. Good Charlotte is not punk, they're pop.Now I don't really have a problem with pop, but the way Good Charlotte displays themselves with is poseur-ish.2. Their music really doesn't deserved to be listened to. Sure, Benji and co. are trying their best. But, they have enough money already, and their music is not what Americans deserve.Their music may be catchy. And if you like it, okay, I can't do anything about it. But next time you listen to this, think to yourself, ""Is this really music? Or is this just loud guitars and pop singers?""Album rating: 2.3Band rating: 1.2"
1,IT SUCKS DONKEY D*CK,"I would give it zero stars but they didn't have a choice, GOOD CHARLOTTE SUCKS MAJOR THAT'S WHY THEY GOT BOOED OFF THE WARPED TOUR LAST YEAR AND THE LEAD SINGER GUY LISTENS TO 50cents!!!! HA, WHAT A LOSER EVERYONE WHO LIKES GOOD CHARLOTTE SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THAT DOESN'T SUCK ASSH!!!"
1,good charlotee the young and hopless,it rattled my nerves. a bunch of noise and ratttling . It didn't sound like music--a bunch of noise.
1,You guys are losers,"You can not be serious. This band does not even comapre to any of the great band so the past. They are wannabe punk rockers who have no talent whatsoever, and it is pathetic that this is what we all have to hear on the radio and on MTV. Please bring us the early 90's with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Rage Agains the Machine, and NIN. These guys don't even compare, they are not even in the same ballpark. You guys better enjoy this now, because sooner or later, you'll come to your senses. Pick up Rage's self-titled disc, and then we'll talk about great music."
1,"Please, whoever wrote that review was a moron","Come on, some idiot said ""if you have so much knowledge of punk then why don't I see your face on my TV everyday?"" Well. THAT'S NOT WHAT F*CKING PUNK IS! THIS BAND SOLD OUT, THEY SING ABOUT WHAT THE COMPANIES WANT TO HEAR! PUNK IS ABOUT ANARCHY, REBELLION, SCARING OLD PEOPLE WITH YOUR HAIR AND CLOTHES (also stupid people). They got booed off the Warped Tour because nobody wants to hear pop at a Punk Tour. If I ever saw GC on the street I'd show 'em what punk is! A baseball bat to the face! The lyrics suck, uninspired. The melodies, untalented. IF YOU SHOW UP ON TV YOU'RE NOT PUNK."
1,GOOG CHARLOTTE BLOWS!,"Just incase you haven't noticed, Good Charlotte is the single WOST BAND TODAY! They truley are pathetic. Don't waste your time or money with this garbage."
1,Skunk rock: music for dullards,"""Lifestyles..."" preaches to the choir, while the rest of the record is unimaginative and re-treaded.The guy singing has a whiny voice that is intolerable - he sounds like a... 12 year old who wants to be a rock star.These guys got nuthin' on real hardcore punk groups like Blink-182 and Green Day."
3,Their best stuff,"Well, even though I'm not the biggest Good Charlotte fan in the world, I kinda liked this album. There was at least 5 songs on this album that became awesome hits. Though, I really doubt that Good Charlotte could ever make another album like this one. I mean now, they have The Chronicles of Life and Death, with songs that pretty much say ""We're a big rock band, but I want all the gullible people of the world to think we're miserable."" So, yeah, The Young and the Hopeless is, indeed, the best Good Charlotte stuff you'll ever hear."
4,My thoughts...,"Personally, GC is one of my alltime fave bands. Who comes here to waste their time dissing a band? Yea, alot of ppl do. It's not about the way they look, or the way they dress, it's about their music and the way it makes you feel. if it makes you feel like scratching your eyeballs out: GOOD FOR YOU! but i really think that GC deserves more credit than they get, and yes i know that evryone is entitled to their opinion, this is mine. i enjoyed the record and it helped me get thru alot! i think that its a great album to get into if you don't want anything too heavy or if you just happen to dislike alot of screaming."
1,This is Punk music? If you think so you don't know Punk,"This is nothing but a ""boy band"" with tattoos. No edge, nothing but hollow lyrics along with a rhythm guitar. These guys are posers in the void that is pop music. Not worth buying, along with the other 10 bands out there that sound exactly like them."
1,disgusting BEYOND disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I could write an encyclopedia on how much I hate this band. They are filhty, unholy, disgusting pigs that serve no purpose of being on this Earth. Their music would make hearing someone scratch their nails on a chalkboard, someone chew aluminum foil in their teeth, and someone cracking their back all at the same sound like the sound of heaven. If you own any cds by these filty, unholy, disgusting pigs, please go check into a nuthouse-THAT IS WHERE YOU BELONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good Charlotte is the prime definition of all that is evil, and their fans are the evil spirits of the underworld"
1,posers,"i had to hear it to belive it. this band is such a peice of crap that it should be burned and destroyed all throughout the world. and no its not punk music. punk is dead first of all. second, it ruins the image of what real punk music was. if u wanna hear real punk music go listen to the real stuff like social distortion, black flag, minor threat, the clash, subhumans, and stuff like that. i wish there was a way to give this band no stars at all..."
5,GC proves that sophomore efforts DON'T SUCK,"If you loved the first GC Self Titled album than you'd be crazy not to buy The Young and the Hopeless. It is definately GC at their finest. Anyone who's seen Good Charlotte LIVE knows the abilities of these unbelievably energetic and down-to-earth guys. This album truly captures what you see at one of their shows: a chaotic combination of music styles that accentuate their powerful lyrics while the melodies shout out fun and freedom to rock! My personal favorite is ""Moving On,"" a song about the things in life that drag you down and the focus we need to place on the good things you'll have when you leave this world.This is a must have album. YOU NEED TO BUY IT. Also it had cool extras for your computer like behind the scenes footage from this past April's Skate n Surf show in Asbury Park NJ. It also has a link to the GC site that gives live footage which changes every 2 weeks. ENJOY THE MUSIC! REPRESENT GC! ROCK ON!"
5,GREAT CD!,"After listening to the self titled cd, you'd think GC would have no more to give. But you were wrong! This new cd is such a great album! All the songs have a lot of meaning to them, plus the beats are awesome. Everyone should buy this cd because GC is just a rad band who won't let you down!"
1,what garbage,"It boggles my mind how this band can be so popular. Honestly, this cd lacks any kind of musical depth. The singers voice is so whiney that it is iritating.I saw these guys at the Warped tour a couple years back and they sucked. I guess that why they would rather host TRL than play a live show. These guys cant sing or play guitar or do anything but go on tv and advertise their album. They think that just because they have serious lyrics that people will thing they are deep and profound. Im not impressed."
1,No substance.,"I am sure this CD makes groups like The Replacements and Husker Du vomit. This is possibly one of the most pathetic CDs of all time. It's hard to sing about anti-conformity when you work for MTV. Even if they wern't extremely large sellouts, nothing in Good Charlotte's music sets them apart from bands such as Blink 182, Less than Jake, and New Found Glory. They simply have cutt and paste lyrics and tabs from every other release in the recent years. Perheps with a little creativity and substance this band could someday be good, but as they stand they disgrace the meaning of the word Punk, and anyone who is associated with it."
2,"not the best, not what i expected","i bought this album dispite what people told me about good charlotte (many people think that they are posers). anyway i bought it because ""lifestyles of the rich and the famous"" was a fairly decent song. well, the rest of this album was terrible! it is not punk at all!! if you want to listen to real punk get greenday or blink 182 or even sum 41. but this is garbage. i know a lot of people liked it, but i have a hard time understanding why."
5,I luv billy!...,OMG this cd is only the best out!! All you punk rockers have to go get it! Lifestyles of the rich & famous and bloody valentine are great songs! And best of all GC is mad hott!! So go buy the cd now!!
1,"utterly terrible, stupid want to be punk rockers.","This album was horrible. If you like punk or ska don't buy this C.D. They are one of the worst bands i have ever heard along with simple plan and new found glory. The tracks are stupid like the one about rich and famous it is so stupid because they now have tons of money and are famous among fake punk rockers. If you want to buy a good CD buy any NOFX, Rancid, or any bands that are produced by Fat Wreck Chords( run by one of the best bass players ever Fat Mike)"
2,Don't even try and call this punk.,"Okay, I'm not someone who has the authority to classify what is punk and what isn't, but even I can recignise that this isn't punk. It's just pop dressed up as an angsty boy/band dressed in black. I'm just glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste money buying it. There are some half decent tracks though, like ""Wondering"" and ""My Bloody Valentine""."
2,Good Charlotte kinda suck and rock...at the same time....,"I am a fan of hardcore metal (eg. Slipknot, Hatebreed) and i like bands such as Blink 182 and Sum 41, but i don't know what went wrong here? one of these guys has like hundreds of tatoos and yet they don't even write bad lyrics or swear or trash the stage in videos and stuff. And why, when i go into a music store, is this title in the METAL section? It should really be under the POP section. So theres one song on here that could fall into the SKATER ROCK category (the anthem) but that that's it. and the lyrics are kinda puny too (i'm beggining to think these dudes stole the lyrics from The Backstreet Boys or something...But on the other hand when i so these guys in concert they were sorta heavyier and more rocky then on CD.So if you want METAL, don't buy this buy SLIPKNOT or something. If you want soft rock then buy it."
5,GOOD CHARLOTTE IS THE BEST!,"Wow! This is the best CD I've ever gotten. Every single song I totally love and that doesn't happen often when I get a CD. Good Charlotte came up with some new awesome stuff! They have honestly become my favorite band after getting this CD. Everyone go out and buy it, it's the best!"
4,Is it a trend to diss Good Charlotte!!??,"Seems to me that everyone's being pretty unfair to Good Charlotte.Is it because they got wierd hairdos ,spikes and tatoos all over their body!?Anyway,I gotta admit that this CD is not as bad as a lot of people say.Good Charlotte have cool songs like Hold On,My Bloody Valentine,Seasons,Motivation Proclamation etc...Their lyrics are also pretty sincere and I find some of their songs very motivating."
1,Wow- MTV is sooooo Punk,"WTF!!!!!!!!! All i hear is lalalalalala Good Charolette is punk. They are possibly the biggest poser pce.o.sht i have ever heard of - do i listen to them -hellls nooooo. Listen up poser be-atches if you want real music, stop watching mtv and buy any album from Slayer, old Metallica, and my favorite metal band, OPETH!!!! God damn some kids are stupid."
1,if there were any less stars...,"wow... that was the worst excuse for punk i have ever heard. i do like punk, but punk this isn't."
1,- 10000 stars!,"simple word to describle this band""n sync with guitar.""crapy dressing, even more crap then 80 hair metal bandnothing to expect"
5,MUST BUY!!!!,OK...honestly there are no words to describe how much this CD ROCKS...If you like any alternative you will enjoy this cd. I know people who are obssessed with Metallica and they have this cd. I know people who don't really like alternative and like this cd. It is totally awesome and a must buy!!!! YOU WILL BE MISSING OUT IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!
5,Good Charlotte is the most talentet group right now....,"When there first cd came out for abouth a year ago, I knew there was something speicial abouth this band... Their new cd is even better than the first, you're stupid if you dont buy it!!! N.B. Good Charlotte when are you going to Denmark(:"
1,"""Corporate Clones"" spring to mind!","I'm not sure who I hate more, these guys or Simple Plan...oh hell, they're all the same anyway! Stop infesting the music industry with your bland, girl-baiting pop-crap!Lord knows why people are praising this band like they're the best thing since sliced bread...realise there IS better music outside the charts!"
4,cool album,"I dont think you can call good charlottes 'wannabees' or 'try hards', they are simply a band who are doing what they wanna do. it rearly annoys me when people write in and say that there just in music for the money and all who listen to them are 'teeny boppers,' rubbish! the young and hopeless album has a mixture of cool lyrics and punk tunes. a rearly good album and i would recomend it to anyone."
5,Amazing!...,"If your a fan of GOOD music, or a great punky sound that get jammed in your head you'll love Good Charlottes new album The Young and The Hopeless. Every time you hear a song youll be humming it all day long. Unlike some music, Good Charlottes not going to get old and [tiresome] you wont get sick of this. BUY IT NOW!... You'll thank me for it!..."
5,a new GC,"i have been a fan of GC for about 3 years now and i loved the self titled cd, but when i got The Young and The Hopeless i was blown away by how much the guys had grown and expanded their music, their a much mature group now and i think it's done good for their music...the C.D. is awesome...every track."
1,the worst band ever,uhhh this is not punk its the pussys at mtv promiting someone becuase they look good or some crap but this is the worst garbage i have ever heard.......this is the worst band ever do not buy this record i prefer korn over these queers
1,Total crap,"honestly, this is by absolutely no means in any form related to punk. grown men wearing eye makeup and whining like a bunch of panzies. they were so desperate to write a teen anthem the called a song anthem and continuously repeated ""this is the anthem"" and ""I dont wanna be like you"" in a pathetic and flacid attempt to sound remotely punk, which failed miserably. I would not wish pain such as this upon my worst enemy, just listen to one ranid song and it becomes apparent how far from punk they truly are. avoid at all costs."
1,poop,yep...I guess the lead singer and I have something in common...the happiest day of both our lives will be when he diesthis album is CRAP...this group is CRAPI don't know why you teenyboppers listen to this junk...its another boy band like Nsync and Backstreet Boysjust because they spike their hair and put make up on doesn't mean anything...its all an image just to make money...
5,Good Charlotte Rox the charts!,"After listening to this cd, I can vouch for many as well as myself, saying this is one of the best cds out at the moment. Although it may be new school punk and not everyone likes punk, it does not cuss, so it's something you can let little children listen to as well as anyone. This is their best music yet and I recommend it to almost anyone!"
1,too bad there isn't a choice for zero stars...,"This is by far the worst crap i've ever heard. These guys have to be the biggest posers in the world. They repeatedly claim that they're punk but really, they are just NSYNC with tattoos and guitars. A review i've read here on Amazon said that these guys write insperational lyrics. That is the dumbest thing i've ever heard. ""the anthem"" talks about not wanting to fit in. ""go to college, a university, get a real job that's what they said to me, but i could never live the way they want."" How is that insperational? telling kids to drop out of school. Great message. avoid this album at all cost. please do yourself a favor"
1,"respect is given, only where it is deserved.","i love to sit here and read all these little girls writing reviews on good charlotte. they aren't real music, they may be able to play instruments.. and open their mouths. but who ever said they had to be good. people putting down bands like dashboard and stuff like that, is utterly pointless.. because they are emo.. they're emotional. and they can be like that. but good charlotte isn't punk, never will be. i dont have respect for them, because they didn't make their way up through anything. mtv is the reason for crap. mtv can burn in hell. because good charlotte will be there with them."
5,Stuck in my CD Player,This album is absolutely awesome...it's stuck in my CD player--I CAN'T GET IT OUT! They are so diverse in their musicianship and penetrating and vulnerable in their lyrics. Looking for the best album of the year? Check out Good Charlotte's sophomore disk!
2,greatest album of all time huh?lol,"This probably one of the most manufactured ""punk rock"" albums out there. ""I dont want to be you, i dont want to be just like yuou.."", they proclaim very ironically yet sound almost exactly like any of other simple plan, new found glory bands out there. Some of the songs are pretty catchy, but the album is highly unoriginal and manufactured and the lyrics are exactly poetry either ""Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know"" sounds like its out of a seventh graders diary.Simply put,they make Blink 182 look like the friggen Pixies."
4,LiSTEN UP CUZ THERE AiN'T NOTHiN FUNNY,"Here it is, another album from the one and only GC! The Young and the Hopeless leaves Billy, Paul, Joel, and Benji certainly not hopeless that this cd will make through another day! It is definitely different from their first, but different for the better. Unlike the first album, this one is more mellow and has even more depth to the lyrics. If GC kept the exact same sound for every album they produce, then they would get old fast, but since they have thrown in a new unique style, the cd is exciting. It's a cd where you may not like it the first day because it's a different sound, but after you listen to it a few times through it hardly leaves your cd player. All I have to say is-GC thumbs up!!"
5,Good Charlotte Rocks,I absolutley loved this cd It has alot more punk in it than the last cd. but its still good Good charlotte is my favorite band and i wasent disapointed one bit with the cd. i recommened to everyone. i hope they keep the cds comin !!
1,Whatever,"Ya so like...what's the bug deal if theyre not punk? Ive spent a lot of time listening to this album and after memorizing basically the whole thing, it started to get on my nerves. they dress like theyve gone to the punk fashion show, they sound like my 9 year old brother, and their music is bad. the only difference between them and britney spears is that britney doznt pretend to be punk and use electric guitars. they are copying greenday, the ramones, social distortion, agent orange, and all those guys who started punk. theyre not even copying them very well."
1,I just can't stop........,"I think you figured out by now that i DESPISE Good Charlotte with an EXTREME BURNING PASSION......The irony is delicious :) :) :PBring on the hate mail ""bEnJi rEpReZeNtAz!"" :) :) :P"
1,We all know the story,"I am so sick of these fat chicks at school who love Good Charlotte. These girls call themselves ""freaks"" and ""goths"" because they wear black 'Made' clothing. You are not a goth. You are a fat poser. Whenever I see that 'Made' brass knuckle on a fat girls back I want to punch a hole in my head. Good Charlotte's clothing brand is called 'Made' because it made punk look bad."
3,I do love Joel and Benji. However...,"this is not a very good c.d. I do like these guys, they're not bad live, they make creative music videos, and a few of the songs are pretty good, like the title track, Hold on, and the Anthem, but everything else is really juvenile and over-processed sounding, and a lot of the lyrics make the guys sound quite immature. Sadly enough, there is only one Joel Madden to go around in this world, but there are hundreds of bands that sound identical to these guys.If youre looking for a c.d. thats gonna move mountains with its brilliance, I suggest you keep looking."
1,a joke,"This is the biggest excuse for punk music I have ever heard. First of all Good Charlotte never sold out, they always were this bad. Good Charlotte is the new brand of boy bands appealing to young girls and guys with no taste in music. So dont waste your time and read all these reviews from 13 year old girls who will listen to anything popular. Instead go buy cds such as The Used and Taking Back Sunday"
2,"this isn't good charlotte, its bad charlotte.","first off, gc have totally sold out. ""girls and boys"" is absolutley terrible just like this whole cd. If you want to check out some good pop-punk look at new found glory or good charlottes first album. DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
