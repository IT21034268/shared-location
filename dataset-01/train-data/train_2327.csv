5,What a start!,"I absolutely love this great band! All their albums are a sheer joy to listen to, over and over, and this 1995 debut effort is all the more amazing in that all their creativity, their remarkable energy, and the surprising diversity of their sounds comes out so clearly so early in the band's career. If you're familiar only with their more recent tunes, do yourself a favour and see where it all began!mgb is one of the few bands I know of whose *every* song is worth listening to. My favourites on this great concept album are the funky ""Vermilion"", the dreamy ""She's Got a New Disguise"", the introspective ""Fearless"", and the great but hidden closing track.Note to Matt Good and company -- get yourselves promoted in the States asap and rocket that original sound of yours to international superstardom! The world is waiting for you..."
3,Not Beautiful Midnight,"Not a great CD, but if you're a big Matthew Good fan it's worth buying. If you're not a big fan of MG then stick to Beautiful Midnight and his solo work."
2,"INCREDIBLE BAND, okay debut.","MGB is an awesome band. And when they make their crossover to the U.S.A., they will leave the competition far behind.But their debut album, doesn't quite stand up to their jaw-dropping follow-up albums ""Underdogs"" and ""Beautiful Midnight"".Probably the best song on this album in the anger-fueled ""Alabama Motel Room"". However, this same track is also available on their ""Raygun"" CD - which, although it is much shorter, is a far superior CD, (The song ""Generation X-Wing"", is outstanding!.).I blame producer John Shepp for not being able to produce an album that displays MGB in all their glory. ""Symbolistic White Walls"", ""Radio Bomb"" and ""Fearless"" are pretty good songs, but MGB have been so much better."
1,A waste of money,"This video would be funny if it weren't so rediculous.They might as well have Hulk Hogan throwing around Steve Urcle.I mean there is no real ability, just random flailing of random extremities.Some one not familiar with this particular martial art, being introduced to it by this video, might completely write it off as useless.If your looking for good instructions on silat, your in the wrong place."
1,Flashy and showy Silat for demo only,"I think of non-fiction martial arts videos as one of three types.1 - instructional . . . here's how to do it2 - reference . . . since you're studying this, here's a reference catalog of the stuff you already know3 - deomonstrational . . . where the person on-camera is showing off his skill and ability without trying to teach you how to do anything or help you learn the art.This video falls into the third category. What he shows are exagerated and flashy applications of Silat. His material is impressive for its athletic demonstration and the beauty of his technique. However, it's not the practical and efficient applications that I like from Silat."
3,OK but...,I learned a few things but expected better. Especially for the price of this book. I don't think that it targeted what I wanted...
2,"Well, it was an easy read","It did have some good info on major competitors and company financials. But in this quick-changing field, those intangibles won't hold true for long! As far as practical info, the reader would be much better off buying a typical ""how-to"" interview book. Martin Yates ""Knock 'em Dead"" is the best I've found"
3,General interview advice.,"Nikki's book contains outdated pharmaceutical company and product information. You definitely have to do your own research. The interview advice is very general and applicable to any career field. There is very little advice to help someone specifically looking for a pharmaceutical sales position. She basically states that you should use a recruiter.The book has a nice appearance and is organized well, but has little useful information."
3,this book is only a little above average,"This is book is different in that it gives information on how to gain knowledge about medical conventions. However,this book does not give an in-depth report of the top companies as claimed. It only lists a couple of well-known companies in the back of the book."
1,Don't waste your money,"The information contained in this book can be found in any job search book- her claim to ""insiders knowledge"" is basic and could be devined from anyone in the industry."
1,Very Basic!!,"This book covers the basics, but that is as good as it gets. This book is not for the experienced job seeker looking to get into the medical sales field. If you have not learned the information provided in this book you have a long search ahead of you! On the other hand, if you have no experience in any job market or this is the first position you are seeking, you may be able to find some useful information. By the way, who edited this book? I read it in one quick evening and I found a considerable number of errors."
5,Future Pharmaceutical Sales Rep!,"I wanted to write to let you know the valuable information I received from reading Medical and Pharmaceutical Sales: How to Land the Job of Your Dreams. I have been out of outside sales for a couple of years now and I am currently a sales trainer. All of this sales experience I have gained over the last couple of years has prompted me to want to jump back into outside sales. This book has given me great direction in my initial search to ""land the job of my dreams."" I feel very confident that my future job in pharmaceutical sales is just around the corner due to the valuable information I gained from this book!"
4,GLAMMY,"A return to form after the rather ""tired"" Kill uncle but not his best solo album.his most commercially sounding one though.Invest!"
5,No Title Needed....Just Listen To It!,"This is a fantastic album. Despite the fact that Morrissey recorded this almost 13 years ago, the music still sound fresh and the lyrics still brilliant. It just makes the bilge they pass off today as good music seem like complete PC crap! When you have it like ol' Moz does, you don't need to try so hard. Go and show that to your stylists BLINK 182 and the rest of you fake nihilist wanker bands."
1,Shows Who the Genius Was Behind the Smiths,"If you ever wondered about who the creative member of The Smiths was, listen to this album and you will know that it was Johnny Marr. This album falls so flat-- all the songs sound the same and the listener is drawn to Mr. Morrissey's lyrics. The lyrics sound like a cross between Oscar Wilde and G. B. Shaw done weakly. I don't think that there's a song on the album worth a second listen with the exception of ""Your the One for Me Fatty,"" which is a novelty song in the vein of ""I'm Too Sexy."""
1,Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review,"""Your Arsenal"":Return to'glam rock'.But Morrissey has the glamour of a sausage and the rockin' potential of Rheims Cathedral.Tiresome controversy stirred up by equally useless NME masks laziness of record in general.Low Point:""I Know I'ts Going To Happen Someday"",a song so poor it was covered by David Bowie."
1,Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review,"""Your Arsenal"":Return to'glam rock'.But Morrissey has the glamour of a sausage and the rockin' potential of Rheims Cathedral.Tiresome controversy stirred up by equally useless NME masks laziness of record in general.Low Point:""I Know It's Going To Happen Someday"",a song so poor it was covered by David Bowie."
5,This is the one!,"If your new to Morrissey this is the one of the best ones to get. It's a strong album from beginning to end, loads of hooks, handfuls of catchy tunes. Moz is Mezmerising (is that how you spell it?).A Great Buy!"
4,exploring yourself,"Bought this album many times, friends keep stealing my copy. ""Seasick"" is like an anthem for those times in one's life. Like all the time! And well, if you love the smiths and just want to hear morrisey's sweet voice and genious lyrics, try it..."
4,Pretty good,"This instant Thai tea did not taste like the Thai tea I've had restaurants, but it was pretty good. I liked it hot rather than cold. It's pretty sweet. I decided to add a very small amount of Cinnamon to it and it came out great. A bit high on calories-180 calories per packet. I would buy it again."
5,SO GOOD,This tastes just like the Thai tea I get from Thai places. I make it hot & then put it in the fridge or freezer for a couple hours. It is so good when it's cold!
2,"tastes okay, but nowhere near restaurant quality.",Doesn't even really taste like Thai Tea. What you get is a rather non-descript sweet powdered drink. Even adding copious amounts of cream or condensed milk didn't help.
4,Nice mixed with Ginger Honey Tea,I purchased this product to mix it with Ginger Honey Tea Chrystal together it adds to the flavor. By itself it also a great tea
2,Not Thai tea!,"The key word here is INSTANT. Don't expect a real Thai tea experience with this instant beverage. It's okay. It doesn't taste bad... Just like Starbucks and instant Taster's choice taste different, so does this with a real Thai tea."
4,We love this Thai iced tea,"The taste is pretty close to the ones from restaurants or what I made from the real tea leaves mixture. My only complain is that it's slightly too sweet, however, my family love the convenient Thai iced tea."
4,Pretty good for instant,"Is this going to give you Thai tea exactly like what you'd get in a restaurant? No. But is it good? For what it is, yes. I bought it to keep at work so when the craving for Thai tea hits me, I can have it. Obviously I can't brew my own Thai tea and add in the ice and condensed milk at my desk and then stick all of that back in a drawer. But I can grab a packet of this instant mix. I am going to figure out how to make real Thai tea so I can have it whenever I want, not just when I'm at a restaurant or bubble tea place with it on the menu."
4,"Live Pat, But A Couple Of Tunes I Could Live Without","If you liked Pat's studio recording, Trio 99-00, then you'll enjoy this live recording of the same band with Bill Stewart and Larry Grenadier. They remake many of Pat's older classics, including ""Bright Size Life,"" which is fun to hear in this new, sped up version. This probably could have been a one-disc item, though, since there are at least three extended tunes, two of which are pure noise: Faith Healer and, to a lesser extent, Counting Texas, on disc two. Mistakes. Terrible mistakes. An 18-minute Question & Answer on disc one is also probably too long by two-thirds, but if you like long drum and bass solos, eh...."
3,take the good with the bad,"Pat Metheny is one of those guys who can undeniably PLAY. The problem comes in his choices. While players like Joe Pass never put out a bad album, Pat's discography is filled with horribly uneven albums.That being said, I'd rate this as one of the better albums in his repertoire, primarily because it's an opportunity to hear him without the studio gimmickry that weighs down most of his other work. I do agree with East-Sider in that the playing here has a fair share of aimless noodling (a common problem for Pat Metheny), but many of the cuts are swinging and enjoyable. There is the seemingly-inevitable MIDI-guitar excursion, but that is mercifully kept to a minimum."
2,Disappointment,"I am sorry to write that this new CD from Pat Metheney is a big disappointment for me. Only three titles are filled with emotions: Question & Answer, All the Things You Are & Faith Healer. The rest is tasteless noodling and smooth jazz."
3,Be careful !!!!!!!!!,"I loved playing with this toy untill it BROKE ! im 12 years old now but when i got it i was about 9 or 10 . but my sis was about 4 , and now she dosen't even try to play with it . we have tryed super + gorilla glue on the roller coaster ride 2 put it back together , but when we played with it a whole lot it just broke again on us ! so now its a dust collector ! u should get this toy , just be careful with it !! it could be much better now though !!!!!!! BYE"
2,Disappointing over time,"I would avoid another versapak product when buying another cordless screwdriver (or other hand held B&D product--I own a few). The batteries do not hold a charge and do not last very long. I have a handful around the house that are useless. Sure, I could buy more, but in the meantime the project I'm working on stalls and the batteries don't work the next time I need them anyway. Avoid until B&D perfects the battery technology."
1,Not worth the price + shipping + annoyance factor,"RIP-OFF! $35 + 3rd party shipping charges over $12 = $47 and a very bad deal -- especially considering that I'm going to have to go find a hardware store any way (not convenient for me). You see, the Black and Decker cordless screwdriver doesn't include any bits at all. Guess I should have read the product description a little more carefully to see what was NOT included in this rip-off deal. Silly me, but the very old battery operated screwdriver that I was replacing did come with bits. (And no, they don't fit this purchase fiasco.) So if you want it, go elsewhere folks, - don't buy it here."
2,It's great when it works - but its not very durable,"I've gone through two of the Pivot Drivers in as many years and am looking for something that will hold up better. I use the Pivot Driver occasionally for odd jobs around the house - nothing heavy. The pivot feature is great, as is the versa-pack compatibility, but the electrical connections are flimsy.The first Pivot Driver I had fell off a work-bench or something else I was working on and worked only intermitently after that. The second one now also functions only intermitently although I'm not sure exactly when it fell to it's demise. I can sometimes get it to work by knocking it on something but I'd rather have one which didn't pivot and worked all the time!"
3,A usefull tool,This tool is very handy for removing panels from small appliances . The only problem I find is that the switch is too sensitive and will activate itself if it rolls in your tool box.
4,Happy.,"I like the great torque, and the battery life is very good. The 2 position, cockable handle turns out to be just right for some tight spots. I have had no battery contact problems at all."
5,Excellent Product,I am extremely impressed with this high quality light. It turns night into day. I am an early morning rider and this light makes me very visible to all traffic; as well as makes it possible for me to see all the road surface in front of me very clearly.
1,Older model - didn't work,I had an older model drill that I bought this for. The battery and charger didn't work.
4,Battery is OK but......,"I recently bought a firestorm 18v battery and charger. The battery came already charged and seemed to be doing well until I tried to charge it on the ""Brand new battery charger I bought"". From better vac tool co. The charger quit working and now I'm out 16 bucks plus shipping. On top of that I can't even use my drill because I have no charged batteries. I urge you to never buy another 18 volt battery charger (ps185). Black and decker has poor quality in the battery charger area. As for the battery...I don't know if it's any good because I can no longer use it until I buy a brand new charger. I think I will just go to sears and buy me a craftsman 19.2 and say the hell with all this internet crap. You really take a chance on what your getting. If you don't like it..guess what? You have to pay your own shipping charges back to the seller. What a joke!!!"
5,Happy with 18V Firestorm,I have had my Firestorm drill for six years with lots of use around the home and garden. Its dependability and comfort makes me very happy with this tool from B&D. The batteries are just now going after 5 and 6 years respectifully. The drill/driver has been dropped from six feet onto cement and kept on working. A small crack is all that now shows.
1,buy a new drill,Will not hold a charge. Do not waste your money in this. Buy a new drill instead. a total rip-off.
2,It's a battery...,"Works fine, charges fine. Doesn't hold a charge as well as I'd like, but it gets the job done."
5,Made my firestorm a screaming drill again!,"So far the battery is what I expected and it fits my drill. I have had the drill and have not used it in five years- this battery made it come alive all over again. It's my preferred drill- preferred over my weaker friend, my 9v Ryobi cordless drill."
4,I Like Them,The Battery's Are Just What I Ordered. I Like Black & Decker Products And Always Have. These Battery's Are Good Quality & Work Perfect.
4,B&D 18 Volt Battery,This is a perfect fit for both the cordless B&D drill/driver and the battery charger. It works fine for powering the equipment .
1,NO bang for our buck!,It's HORRIBLE!!! It came all charged up and hasn't held a charge since. I'm very disappointed in it. What a waste of our hard-earned money!
3,Superior intercom,"Though I am not an owner, I am shopping and have downloaded the manual. P. 41 describes intercom use, and it is apparent that all handsets can be paged from any individual handset. This point is not to be underestimated.A more expensive competing model, the Panasonic KX-TG6074, facilitates paging to all handsets ONLY from the base unit. '6074 handsets are enabled to page only specific alternate handsets. This is a shortcoming when one is hoping to transfer a call, but does not know which other handset needs to be picked up."
2,They're okay...,"I bought a set of these phones, one for my house and one for my parents. They were inexpensive phones compared to other similiar cordless sets but I guess I got what I paid for. My previous Uniden phone I liked much better than these. The dial tone has a lot of jumbled noise and my parents phones have a lot of static that their previous phones didn't. All in all they haven't been bad but I wouldn't buy them again. I'd pay a little more and look for better."
2,Uniden DCT758-4Expanded Cordless System with Digital Answering System and call Waiting/Caller ID,"Phones had buzzing interferance,upon pickup calling party was not there all the time, volume always varied,either too loud or you could not hear caller."
4,phone review,"I purchased this system for our home and so far so good! sound is clear and for the price you cant beat it, the phones are smaller than what i had thought but thats not a bad thing!one would think it would be easy to delete your answering machine messages, although i havent figured it out yet and i did read the book, so that part is a little confussing! if your thinking of purchasing this phone system go for it! for the value is a good purchase"
1,Bad design,"Half the prongs point one direction, the other half point the other direction (Not like the picture) Making it tough to get on and off. Luckily, my brother gave me an old collar he had by another maker. This one just hangs on a shelf."
5,Works great!!!,"I use the collar daily on a service dog. Since I've started using this collar, it has been extremely useful and effective!!! Thank you so much!!!!!"
4,great but 1 negative,"It wasn't clear by the description that you were unable to use the inflator while plugged in. However, it performed more than adequately with a full charge. Note: You can use the car adaptor in a power emergency - when the battery is almost fully discharged."
5,Another great add to your house collection,"This is a truly sensational house track. Holly James teaming up with Jason Nevins was probably the best move in her whole career. ""I'm In Heaven"" gives you a clear picture of Holly's future and the direction that she is heading towards (upwards of course).I first found out about this song on XRM TV, and was simply amazed by her vocals. I was also amazed at the video, which I found to be particularly sexy. :) You really can't go wrong with this song; if you haven't listened to it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up. You won't regret it."
2,"i'm in heaven Jason Nevins , Holly James","the music does nothing for me. It might be meant for teens instead , i don't know. But it does absolutely nothing for me. sorry. that is the truth."
2,Useless for the amateur,"This book should have been titled ""Interviews with the masters of sheet metal fabrication"" instead. Very little content to show the uninitiated how to achieve a particular goal or effect in sheet metal-work. It consists predominantly of interviews with different practitioners of particular approaches to sheet metal shaping, with the bottom line being: ""You could do this w/ hammer & dolly, or any of several other methods, but this is the faster approach I prefer..."" It was an interested read, but not something worth keeping as a reference. I wish I had saved my money."
1,Watch two Biker Build Offs on TLC you will learn more,"about metal working than this terribly mis-titled book. Read the other low rated reviews. They cover the problems well enough. Only thing I can figure is all the 5 star reviews are friends of the author or something.One guy mentions how much he learns about metal shrinking. My question is how? It is mentioned many times. In one place they have a photo caption saying heat shrinking works by heating a spot and then blasting with air to quick cool it. As for mechanical shrinkers, they never tell you how they work. Or give any info on how to figure out how much or how to really shrink metal. You will learn it can be shrunk and pretty much nothing else.For someone wanting to learn metal work, it isn't useless. It is pretty close to it. You honestly can learn more by watching some Biker Build Offs as metal is worked in the background. I haven't been this disappointed in a book in many years."
4,Heads up Custom car builders!,"What I found in this book, as a bodyman, was that it helped me to understand how to form sheetmetal into patch panels to fit better, how easy it was to manipulate the sheetmetal with several new techniques. Unless you have some power tools, this could be a major workout for your hands and arms, but with limited tools you can form just about anything your mind can create."
5,"...destined to become the ""bible"" of polio and PPS.","THE POLIO PARADOX is destined to become the ""bible"" of polio and PPS."
4,Knowledgeable Information,"Haveing had Polio when young, I thought I hadovercome many of the effects.Now that I am getting up in age, I find many ofthe original effects appearing again. Especially inmy leggs. My doctor suggested this book would givea good explaination of why.Yes the book allowed me to learn many things aboutPolio that I did not know."
4,Post Polio Syndrome,In depth reaseach on post polio and related viral diseases. Must read if you or someone you know has this. Explains why you feel rotten and what to do about it.
5,You cannot put THE POLIO PARADOX down...,"I have just finished reading Dr. Bruno's book, THE POLIO PARADOX, and it is absolutely wonderful! It is one of the best books I've ever read. You cannot put THE POLIO PARADOX down until you read through to the end, whether you have polio brain fog or not. Bruno has used his uncanny humor and wit to make the book read like a story. Whatever you didn't know or questioned about polio and PPS, the answers are ALL in THE POLIO PARADOX! And I didn't need a dictionary beside me while reading. I'm like each of you in that I want my life back, or at least a part of it. This book gives you a ""plan"" as to how to get your life back! THE POLIO PARADOX is a MUST for ALL polio survivors."
2,The Polio Paradox,"Not a good first read. Mr. Bruno is depressing. I suggest Dr. Silver's book Post-Polio Syndrome, it is excellent!"
5,Every polio survivor deserves to know the truth,"Every polio survivor deserves to know the truth about polio and ""Post-Polio Syndrome"" -- its diagnosis, cause and treatment -- to be found in THE POLIO PARADOX."
2,wedding pretzels,"We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. The pretzels would not have been bad for anything else, but there were way too many broken ones... we would have had to buy five more barrels. My only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven't received our refund!"
4,Perfect,"Exactly what I was looking for. No incline so that water drains out, but I just stick a roll of tape under the end."
4,I love it!,It is a good sized dish rack and not hard to clean when it needs. I can put all of my pots which I don't want to wash in the dishwasher in this rack and it's been used after every meal. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Love it !,"I got this for $12 from amazon and I am so happy I got this great deal ! This is perfeft and exceedes ,y expectations. It's quite large and looks great. Serves its purpose well"
1,Hated it,"The groves i don't know what they were there for because they didn't hold the plates or bowls. The place for the utensils wasn't useful either it was big and they all fell over and didn't hold up straight. the packaging wasn't presentable either, it just came in this big box with paper inside. It came late also. I am very unsatisfied with this product and i am going to return it as soon as possible."
1,Poor Quality,"This cable is thick and seems to be well made, that is until you start moving it, plugging and unplugging ect. If you are going to use this cable for an application where you plug it in and leave it alone it might work. If you plan on using it to connect a laptop or mp3 player to external speakers(applications where you will be constantly plugging, unplugging and moving it around) you may want to look at something of higher quality. The problem I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve(silver) comes unscrewed from the jack(gold) and with little surface area to grasp it is difficult to tighten adequately; also if you bump or move the cable while music is playing through it will cause a cracking sound in your speakers and often the left channel will mute. Like I said this cable might work if you never move or unplug it but otherwise look elsewhere. On the positive side cable does seem to be made of heavy, quality material."
1,Looked promising,"The construction seemed very durable when I first got it and everything worked as expected, but a few months after my purchase the solder joint broke on the female end. I soldered it back up only to find that the connecter itself started to go bad. My headphone cable does not sit very firmly in the connector and either the left or right channel cuts out based on how the connector is rotated."
2,Broke within 8 months,"This seemed like a really nice audio cable until one of the channels (left side audio) broke. I used it with my computer speakers at first and within a month of putting it in my car, it broke. Belkin has a pretty good replacement guarantee, so they are sending me a new one. (I have to pay return shipping for the defective product). At first I thought it was my equipment, but I purchased a different cable that worked fine. Just a heads up!"
2,Worked for six months...,"Pros:Good CableGold PlateCons:6 month lifebulky ends don't fit some portsAs the title of my review said, this cable worked for about six months, before one of the channels died. This is a bit short lived, but compared to some of the other similar cables out there, I do not consider this atrocious. I paid something like $8 for this, and live outside the US, so it is not worth it to me to use the ""lifetime warranty"". Another slightly annoying thing is that the cap near either end of the wire makes it too bulky to plug in to a few of the things I needed it for. However, these can be unscrewed, making the cable appear less attractive, but useable in most speaker ports."
3,it works but....,"I bought this cable to use it to connect my iphone to my car. I can't seem to get the cable to plug in all the way unless I take off my iphone case. Also, after I took off the case, the plug seems to be loose in my iphone, therefore it'll fall out if i move the phone too much. All in all, this cable works but you might want to look for another cable if you want to use it with an iphone."
1,Not happy at all,I bought this cable to connect my Palm TX with my car stereo (I use my palm for MP3s and for audio books) The specs on this cable indicate that both male ends are 3.5mm connectors. I know the specs for the Palm TX say that the headphone jack is 3.5mm - But no fittee. The cable is too loose. I think the plug may simply be a tad to short and therefore is not completely seating. Please reference the images associated with this cable before buying.
5,Oops!,I ordered this as a replacement item for same thought lost! About two days after placing the order for the replacement tool I found the 'lost' one.The 'lost' tool had served me quite well over a period of several years which is why I ordered a duplicate to replace it.
1,11045 without a textured handle or wrong Product #?,Klein 11045 wire stripper should have a TEXTURED handle. you may check on Klein tools product catalog online or to Square Box store. I have 11045 wire stripper for about 6 months now and so far so good. I will give it 5 stars if it is an REAL 11045 wire stripper from Klein tools.So the product here may be a fake one. BE CAREFUL shopping online.
4,tourette syndrome the facts,"An ideal 1st book for those who have recently been diagnosed, and for family and friends.This is easily digested,but has not been ""dumbed down"".Written in a positive way it contaians some sensible advice about coping with TS in the real world.Written by 2 of Englands top specialists in Tourette Syndrome ,it is a book that gives you the confidence to question the doctors,and answer those posed by people who want to know more about your problrms.The extensive bibliography gives many leads for anyone wanting a more indepth understanding of the syndrome,and the suggested ""introduction card"" deserves a special credit of its own.This is a book I would recommend to who is interested in the syndrome,at any level."
3,A Bit Too Academic,"While I enjoyed much of what was written, felt the overall approach was too academically oriented and detached. Wish more emotion and personal stories were featured"
3,terminator,this game took me less than 20 minutes to beat the game is based on the movie i caution all players who want this game should know there are no continues in this game the game is tough at first but i would not reccomend on getting this game if your not a fan of the terminator movies
3,Review quickie Terminator on Sega Genesis/Megadrive,In October 1984 James Cameron's The Terminator was released in theaters I reviewed Terminator 1 awhile back so look for it under my reviews. Well 6 years later Sega put this on there new system the Megadrive or the Genesis & anytime a big action sci fi movie makes big bucks games are bound to follow a franchise. I really like Terminator Terminator 2 Judgement Day Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles & Terminator Salvation & I do think this could be a better games it's not bad but honestly I think if you already have a Genesis/MD you should go get a Sega CD & get the Sega CD version of The Terminator it has 10 levels an awesome soundtrack is a face paced game & uses FMV to tie in each location. Genesis version only has 4 levels & can be beaten in 20 minutes & the music is not bad & it has a nice 16 bit version of Brad Fidel's Terminator 1984 theme. I recommend the Sega CD version over this but this version is a lot better than the NES & SNES versions.
2,It broke the first day I got it with normal use.,"There is a plug and a graft over the plug to seal it. While playing with this thing, not using hard force but normal force, the plug leaked, and it was rendered useless. I'm not buying gel again, only foam."
5,Takes Me Back,Love the game! Had it when I was younger and lost it. Now that I have it again it's time to play!
5,Very good book and easy to understand.,"Very good book and easy to read and understand. Clear information on what exercises work which muscles. A helpful diet section, exercise schedule, and weekly exercise diary."
5,Packs a big sound in a small can!,"Don't let the small size (4-1/2"" height) fool you. This boat horn packs just as much ear-piercing blare as the larger size cans. For anyone who likes to keep one of these handy at home for security purposes, this is a handy size."
5,Loud to the Extreme,"Woah.....This Airhorn is loud.... Louder than I expected. Pulling pranks is so easy. 5-stars. Oh, and please be careful. Don't put it near your ear........ XD"
4,Excellent for learning and reference,This book is perfect for learning and keeping it around for reference. Reading this book filled in the blanks of what I didn't know about clientdatasets. A must have.
5,Agree. A must have for Delphi-ers,I agree with all previous reviewers that this is a must-have for Delphi-ers. It provide both practical guideline as well as in-depth knowledge of inner workings of ClientDataSet.
3,they say you can never go back,"this was the reunion album with original singer from the first 2 albums. Some catchy parts here and there, along with some good guitar solos, but the unique dark thrashing energy and songwriting of the early metal church is not very present. Sounds like megadeth in spots. Also the vocalists voice has changed over time...he sounds like Saxon vocalist Biff Byford on this."
3,possibly metal church's best...,"...Although given my somewhat phlegmatic view on their previous albums that may not mean too much.The best two songs on the album are the first two, both speed-metal stompers of a very traditional sort. If the whole album had been like this I would have been content. However, they do slow it up frequently, and I find their slower songs less interesting.Overall, not very original, not particularly complex or intricate, just a solid slab of traditional speed metal. A welcome comeback.A high 3 rating."
5,It's a strong come back.,"This album is very much like the first one. It's fast, loud and exciting. The previous one ""Hanging in the balance"" was almost hardrock rather than heavy metal. However this album is real heavy metal and even a bit trash. If you are a Metal Church fan, you will love it, if not, you will become a new Metal Church fan. Don't miss it. Listen and enjoy yourself."
1,METAL CHURCH NO LONGER METAL !!!!,"I HAVE EVERY RELEASE FROM METAL CHURCH. THEY ARE ALL AWESOME, EVEN THOUGH ''HANGING IN THE BALANCE'' IS NOT THEIR BEST.. IF YOU WANT THEIR BEST THEN GET THEIR SELF-TITLED DEBUT, OR ''HUMAN FACTOR'' STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE IT WILL ONLY PUT YOU TO SLEEP...."
4,claaic metal church cd with near original band!,this is the best metal church cd since blessing in disguise hands down classic form tigth music and musicals in great form.this has all the classic metal church sighs and sound a shame they can't get this on the other 6 newer cds.
2,"Forgive me Father, for I must give this a bad review...","OK, for starters, I have been a Metal Church fan since The Dark. And have been a fan... until now. Sorry, but this new CD just doesn't do it for me. Sure, it's good to see David Wayne has returned to the band, but his voice has somewhat deteriorated in the past years. His voice sounds more whiney and nasal than before. I found myself wincing in pain trying to tolerate the vocals. (I only made it to Lb. Of Cure on the CD.) Mike Howe will be missed because he had the voice that fit in PERFECTLY.Albums such as Blessing In Disguise and Human Factor were truly awesome CD's (as were their self-titled and The Dark) but I think it's time the band turned in their guitars and drums, and just retire. The music on this CD is just rehashed music from the 80's with no thought or time put into them. Who knows though, maybe they will put a new album out that totally blows this one away. Only time will tell I guess. Later."
2,metal church's last with david wayne,"This album could have been so much better.The thing that made metal church great was a combined effortby all the musicians to write an album.On this cd, Vanderhoof wrote every track for what ever reason,and the cd should have been called Vanderhoof.When you look back at for instance, The Dark-every song was a collaboratedeffort. This cd desperately lacks every one else's input, especiallyCraig wells.Vanderhoof is a great guitar player and writer, how ever when he and wellswrote together incredible things happened that would cause the rest of the world to listen.There are a couple of ok songs on this, but for the most parti think after David Wayne did his awesome reverend thing i am surprisedhe could go through with this.I was disappointed with this album for the above reasons.However if you dont know a whole lot about the bands historyyou may find it appealing because you wont know what you are missing."
5,the ORIGINAL seattle sound,"you want seattle? this is seattle. if you have a lily liver, buy that tinny-sounding alternative trash, but if you have a liver, this is what you should get. EXTREME METAL RULES!"
3,Short Lived Goodness.,"Fun and funny game, good for two player. It is any easy game to beat because of how short the game is. Other wise well made and fun."
5,it seems to me..,"well i personally dont play the piano, but when hard pressed to do so i can pound out hot cross buns, but i thought it was extremely funny that my friends, who do play the piano, and well might i add...had a tad bit of difficulty playing the songs. Of course the book was said to be easy piano, and i cant refute that, but one thing i did notice was that to actually sing half of those songs you had to be one heck of a soprano. at least thats my opinion. other wise it was a great book. the songs were fun, and i am glad i own it. now if i coudl only get it back from my friend."
1,Garbage,"This is exactly what represents the pathetic 80's. A band that has no personality,steals their sorry sounding crap from the lamest band around at the time in Queensryche and tries to convince people they have talent. Which they surely have none. The vocals are some of the worst I've ever heard in my life. So much yowling like a girl with clothespins on her you know what it's just a horrible experience. I happened to see these idiots at L'Mours years ago and they gave you 100 percent pure suck. Thank God they disbanded. Do not waste 10 cents on this piece of s@$t."
5,Awesome Game!!!,"This is one of my all time favorite Genesis games.It's so action packed.It is based off the Frank Miller comic of the same name.This version on the Genesis is alot better than the SNES version.This version's got blood and gore,the SNES version doesn't.The game can be kinda tough at times,but there are alot of pickups and cool weapons,such as laser guns and machine guns.The graphics are great,and so is the music.I really wish they would re-make this game,for the current consoles.That would be so cool....but until they do,whenever that might be,we can always enjoy this old school classic in the meantime.Five stars all the way!"
5,Inspiring reading for writers and would be writers,"Susan Perry has written a book rich with information and expert anecdotes about how to attain flow-like states during writing. It should appeal to writers wanting to improve their quality of experience during writing, and to those interested in understanding different applications of the flow experience. Well worth the read."
1,Infomercial.,"This book fails my simple test for utility: The writer never gets around to describing, detailing, or otherwise explaining how you can get the results she gets. The book comes without user instructions.No clear schematic and instructions is a common problem with self-help books. Most people are oblivious to exactly what it is they do well because the behavior is habituated. Consequently they cannot transfer the process to others because the process is outside of conscious awareness.The book reminds me of an infomercial. It's almost entirely testimonials about how wonderful life can be if youre ""In the Flow."" But it never maps how you get from HERE to the FLOW."
2,Author Not In the Flow,"This book reads like a text. It's boring. The author, while well-intending, I'm sure, doesn't have a clue as to keeping a reader reading. Getting half way through this book was a chore, and the worse part? There was little to glean. The author sounds like a teacher from the 1950's. When I read a book on writing, especially once purporting to teach the reader how to write ""in flow,"" I'm expecting the author to practice what she preaches. It would behoove the writer to read books that read well--not a book that promises to teach smooth writing when it's didactic, and so long-winded."
1,Terrible,This book is terrible. I wasted my money buying this junk. It is so boring. Susan shows that she is not a writer but a psychologist. How someone like her ever got into print I will never know. The people who gave her good reviews do not know what they are talking about. If you do not believe me check out the book for yourself. But look it over before you buy it so that you will not get burned.
4,I already knew it but...,Have you ever had the pleasure of doing something you love so much that hours pass without notice? Writing in Flow shows you how to let go of what keeps you fastened in the editor's seat and drop into the bliss of the writing process. Nice to know there's a name for what I always felt but never understood.
1,Repetitive and not helpful,"I, like most people, bought this book hoping that the mysteries of consistently entering that wonderful state of flow would be revealed.Alas, what I found instead were interviews with dozens of writers mainly explaining what flow is. Chances are, if you don't know what flow is then you probably wouldn't be interested in the book in the first place. In fact, the first 40 pages or so are spent entirely with defining ""flow"". The rest of the book is variations of the same theme.While she does reveal working habits of writers, she admits that just because something works for someone it doesn't mean it will work for you. I could have figured that out for free.I think Ray Bradbury summed it up much more succinctly in his essay ""Zen in the Art of Writing"" - ""Work. Relaxation. Don't think!"". That advice from a master will go much farther in helping you get into flow than anything Susan Perry has to say in her book."
3,Insightful: A Writer's Psychology of Space & Time.,"As a philo/psyche major, ""Writing in the Flow"" was interesting...to a point. The author has done some heavy duty reseach into the the minds of several published writers. They share challenges, struggles, and successes often dependent on where their head is at. The reader ""discovers"" the arena of Flow..that sustained feeling of loosing oneself in time & space penning thoughts/feelings on paper.While the information was enlighting, after a bit, I longed for solid food about the dynamics of authorship. For me, this book could have been half the size and made its point.I truly appreciate Susan Perry's work, ability to communicate her findings & credentials to do so."
3,Meh,"While the figures are ok, the lack of weapons and the small throne make this more for die hard collectors then casual fans."
3,Not bad,"I don't know whether to recommend this or not. It's functional and somewhat intuitive. It handles system resources sloppily - get more than 4-5 windows open you'll be getting messages about low system resources (fwiw, my machine is has 256M RAM and 30G free space). Problem is alleviated but not fixed in version 3.1. Note to Biblesoft: This is an inexcusable handling of resources.That said, as a program I've found it useful, especially for studying specific verses or chapters. It's much easier to search these dictionaries than hardcover ones; ditto for word studies and commentaries. You pull up a verse, and dictionary, commentary, and other cross-referencing is a click away. The supplied Matthew Henry commentary is superb, a ""must have"" no matter what program you get. The Barnes' Notes are mostly excellent too. These two commentaries make a good team. Now if they'd just get all the Banner of Truth commentaries in there, we'd be in commentary heaven."
3,diehard fans only...,"for the price, you don't get much here, and you're better off waiting to just get this track on a NOW compilation or something. You get the original and the ""remix"", which isn't really remixed, it just features an added rap by Avant. ""Santa Baby"" is as good as that song can ever be. If you've heard the Eartha Kitt, Madonna, or Kylie Minogue version of this annoying Christmas tune, you're pretty much set.This entire single only gives you 10 minutes of music."
1,The Pussycat Dolls need to stick with my idea,LEAVE THE MUSIC BUSINESS. They can't sing worth a DAMN. They need to be destroyed.
1,Disgusting,"""Stickwitu"" is the most water-downed, artificially sweetened, moldy cotton candy song I have ever heard in my life. I have to change the station whenever the song comes on. It makes me ill. I can't wait for PCD's 15 minutes to be up."
2,broadway bound,"the quality of this video collection is poor on several of the movies, only two were of a quality to enjoy the program"
1,10 Movie Pack Broadway Bound,This moviepack is awful. 10 movies in very low resolution. The picture is sometimes so blurred that it is hard to tell who is who. It's an outrage that this is offered as a serious product. Don't buy it!
2,Exploding capacitors,"I had two Evga 256mb cards SLI'd together and they ran very well for two years. All of a sudden, the PC shut down and would not power up. Thinking the CPU was fried, I replaced the MB, RAM, and CPU, but kept the two video cards. Lo and behold, while playing the very same old game (Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory) the PC shut down again and would not even power up. Knowing that the only components common to the old and new PC's were the video cards in SLI mode, I removed one card. The PC powered up and booted normally. Upon examination of the video card that I removed, I discovered 6 of the 10 capacitors had ruptured. Don't know why, other than an obvious over-heat situation. The other card is fine. Bottom line, be wary of connecting two of these video cards together in SLI mode!"
5,Very Freeing,"I found this to be a very fresh and scholarly look at some very difficult scriptures. This book did an excellent job of uncovering some of the prejuidices and errors that have been misread into these scriptures. I am a very conservative scholar myself and some explanations would not be acceptable. However the Kroegers have used solid hermenuetics and I found their research very complete. I would also recommend Charles Trombley's book ""Who Said a Woman Can't Teach"". I do not recommend ""Women in Ministry"" as was recommended by another reviewer of Kroeger's book. The viewpoints espoused in that book are very negative towards women and very traditional."
1,DO NOT BUY CLIMB A TRON,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. Climb a Tron - suction DOES NOT WORK on Glass or ANY upright smooth surface. Only surface we could get to work on was a flat wooden table top and it kept falling over, also if it went any distance and came in contact with an obstacle it would not reverse as advertised. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Thought the item looked interesting and could be a learning tool for grandchild. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT."
2,Breaks Too Easy,"My son bought this from a museum gift shop when we visited the Smithsonian in D.C. We did get it to work going up glass in the hotel room, pretty cool. Unfortunately, the first time he tried it on a glass door at home, it walked up the glass and then fell to it's doom on the hard landing below. One foot assembly is now broken off. When it works it is very interesting to see, but watch out because it will always fall eventually and you must be ready to catch it! He wasn't..."
2,barely works,"This toy can climb a few inches up the window sometimes. Once or twice it went all the way up. Usually it can't, and it can't climb walls."
1,terrible toy,this toy is terrible - needs extra tiny screwdriver to put batteries in - like eyeglass size. then it doesn't work as advertised - does not stick to upright glass. I bought this at the Museum of Science and Industry - not the souvenir I was hoping for for my 5 year old. Do Not Buy this junk!
5,Very Pleased,"The shoes were just as described, also a very reasonable price. I like shopping amazon."
5,Great headset!!!,"The headset is comfortable to wear all day, the sound quality is great, and the noise-cancellation is also excellent. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,Bad business,"GN Netcom 2125 Flex Noise-Canceling Dual HeadsetI have no idea how it sounds to others or how they sound to me, this device is not usable as it comes. It has some kind of quick disconnect at the end of the cord but no way to hook it to your phone without some kind of adapter. It should have had some kind of universal plug in as vertually all phones do, either a 1/8 pin plug or 2.5mm but some way of hooking it up. I now have to figure out what the adapter is called before I can order it, FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY on top of what I already paid."
4,Better than I expected,"To tell the truth, I was a little worried when I ordered this item. With some other ball heads selling for $100 or more, how good could a $25 one be?Well, not too bad, actually. It's larger and more rugged than I expected (about 3"" high), which is important because I want to use it with a fairly expensive and heavy Nikon DSLR. It rotates easily in all dimensions and locks securely with a 1/8 turn of its decent-sized handle, and it doesn't slip. Unfortunately, there's no weight rating given, but it handles my Nikon with no problem.True, it's Chinese and generic (the ""Sunpak"" name was just a plastic label that was peeling off), and the finish isn't as smooth as a $100 unit, but it works well. However, I'd be afraid to use some of the smaller, cheaper ball heads, except with a very light point-and-shoot camera."
3,Sunpack medium ball head,"It's rare for ball heads without quick-release plates to be designed to allow the camera body to be pulled down directly against the platform as opposed to being pulled down indirectly by being rotated across the platform. I've scraped off the cork surface of other ball heads with the usual design. The capacity of this head is 6.5 lbs. I'm afraid of stripping the threads by over-tightening the lever, so it's not rock solid with my 400 mm. lens. I have a Stroboframe head that's only slightly heavier but is stable with much more weight: it may be because its ball is aluminum and the Sunpak's is plastic; however, I prefer the Sunpak because of the platform feature that I described above."
3,Cheap packaging.,"As yet, I don't have an assessment of the CD itself but the packaging was very disappointing. It is only packaged in a thin cardboard sleeve instead of being in a plastic case."
3,a good supplementary tool,"A regular electric B&D drill runs at a top speed of about 1200rpm whereas this on is only about 650. 7.2volt will not produce enough power to drive screws longer than two inches into any hard wood. Also, a fully charged battery set lasts only about 20 minutes. If you want only one drill at home, this is not a very good choice."
2,Black & Decker VP 870 Versapack cordless drill,Good tool if you use it for handy work around the house. Limited power but is also light & easy to use. Not for tough or long jobs but OK for random fixit work. One negative---The forward / reverse switches are poorly located & it is very easy to change from forward to reverse (or visa-versa) inadvertantly just due to routine handling. I expect better design from Black & Decker.
2,Drill? Or Screwdriver,"It would have been nice if the description mentioned that this ""drill"" does not come with drill bits, but only a plethora of phillips head and flat head screwdriver attachments. It's not easy to install something without a guide hole. Now I have to figure out which drill bits go with this drill. Grrr... Also, it's pretty damn heavy, which makes installing curtain rod holders difficult if you're a 135 pound weakling like me. I'm not as happy with this as I should be."
2,"Decent tool for small jobs, but mine is in the trash","The batteries don't hold much charge. I have done several small projects, but always had to wait 24hrs for the battery to charge. On a recent flooring project, the battery would die after 15-20 holes through hard lumber. Good for small projects, but please consider a better alternative if you need power and running time."
4,Good portable drill,"Not for the toughest jobs, unless you want to take a while. And be sure you have spare batteries for it. But I haven't found any job around the house it can't do yet, given enough time."
3,confessions of a pastors wife,"having being a member of CCBTC before they went ""left"" It was interesting to read what happen and what Barbara went through. Sad situation."
2,dont waste your time,The book by ethel wood is way better- and my teacher gave us that to use as study guides. It went more into detail and was gave specific information that was usable on the AP exam. This book is vague and focuses more on keeping your attention that teaching you anything. Dont waste your time or money with this book.
3,best one so far,Of all the few books I've found on comparative government this is the only one that actually has good stuff in it. it just doesn't have any practice essays or multiple choice before the final practice tests. That's what I needed the most.
3,Quick review but not comprehensive.,This book was very helpful in regard to broad concepts as well as certain countries but on other countries it was very shotty. It never hurts to have an extra review book but you cannot rely totally on this book for your review.
4,A Must Have for Teachers and Students!,"Students and Teachers preparing for the Advanced Placement Exam in Comparative Governments can benefit from this non-threatening, easy to use guide. Wedding coaches students in the best strategies to approach the AP Exam, the complex terminology, and the theory before embarking on the review of the five separate countries. Finally! This is a book that aides the teacher in structuring the course, and prepares the students to ace the Exam!"
4,Good Sandpaper,"These adhesive backed sanding sheets are very easy to use and the quality is great. I use them with a DEWALT D26441 2.4 Amp 1/4 Sheet Palm Grip Sander and they fit perfectly.Pros:---------------+ Convenient, easy to use. Just peel off the adhesive and stick them on your sander.+ Good quality sandpaper, holds up well.Cons:---------------- Expensive compared to standard sandpaper sheets, but you are paying for the convenience."
1,dont know,i cant write a review bc i didnt order this item was shipped to me by ax so cant write anything on this item
3,"Watch TV on your computer, Not really?","Everything is AOK with this HP Media Center m1180n -- EXCEPT you CANNOT watch TV unless you hook up your Cablebox (with a cable splitter)/or DSL to the computer -- This was VERY Misleading. My computer is located no where near the television set. I had assumed the TV Tuner was built in. The FM radio is fine, because it included an antenna.TV (watching, pausing & recording) is a part of Media, and I am missing that part."
4,Battery,When I first put them on charge the charge blinked as if bad battery but after a couple hours it tooka charge just find.
1,Will not hold a charge,"The Black and Decker website claims these batteries will recharge 300 or 500 times (depending on which page you view...). My drill with 2 batteries is about 5 years old, and I would say I have recharged the batteries no more than 15-20 times. They are now vitually useless. They will recharge, but in 3-5 days on the shelf they are completely dead. As others have mentioned, I can go buy a new drill with 2 batteries and accessories for [...], or pay [...] for 2 new batteries. Guess which I will do..."
4,New battery for an old screwdriver,"I Was looking for replacement batterie for a B&D 2920torque screwdriver . Ordered batterie, receivedon time. Charged new battery for 24 hours and everything is ok"
5,easy purchase,"I needed this battery, and it was so much easier to order it than run from store to store trying to find it. It was shipped right to my door in just a few days."
3,Review of PS130,This is the forth one of these batteries I have Purchased in the last three years. They all seem to arrive with their date code at lest one year old. I then get a year to two use before the battery will no longer hold a charge . They do not last long.
1,Weak,"Get a Dewalt. The B&D products are not made as well and will not get through as many projects. Plus, the B&D batteries don't last very long at all."
5,Lots of Power,Plenty of power for jobs around the house and holds a charge well.12 volt batteries/drills are great for the casual cordless drill user.This style battery is getting harder to find and the price was reasonable.
5,Black & Decker,"Black & Decker is at the top of the list for Handy Man tools.They have affordable pricing, high quality, ease of use, and durability.Amazon is the place to buy them."
3,Might be better getting a new drill,"At the rate the quality and power change in cordless drills, and the prices continue to come down, you may consider just getting a new drill. At this writing, this replacement battery is $30.62. A new B&D; 12v drill (drill, battery, and charger, not to mention a new warranty), is $7 more. Plus, for $8 more you can get a 14.4v B&D; drill.Sorry, I just do not see the value in just replacing the battery. This needs to sell for $15 or less before it has value."
1,Waste of Money,"The PS130's are an inferior battery. Mine died a sudden death after three years of casual service. Not impressive. Another review suggested the DeWalt DC9071. It has the same contact as the PS130. It charges fine with a B&D charger and works with the 12volt drill/driver. In fact, it puts the drill on steroids. The only problem is that the Dewalt has a ridge around the battery case that prevents the clip holders from grabbing. I just use a big, strong rubber band to hold the thing in place. A little flakey, but it's worth the extra kick and power of the Dewalt battery. Buying a replacement PS130 is throwing good money after bad."
3,I CAN TELL YOU WHERE TO GET THE CHARGER,"...but if you've got the cash, you might as well go ahead and get a REAL drill. The number one problem I have with this lemon is that it can't hold small bits...the chuck is poorly designed. I just had the charger conk out on me...first of all, these batteries don't hold a charge for too long; now, no one carries the charger...Well, almost no one:http://doityourself.com/store/028877325163.htmSo I hope that helps the person who posted about not being able to find the charger."
2,The drill works ok but the batteries die very fast.,I bought 4 of these drills - two for me and two for friends.All batteries get tired quickly with usage and they die quickly ( in that they no longer hold a charge at all ). A new battery costs $35 and I only paid $45 for the complete drill/charger/bits so buying new batteries seems like a waste. I bought the Dewalt drill ($180) which came with two batteries and _really_ like it. It charges fully in 1 hour has _lots_ of power and the batteries last quite a while.
4,no problems,Works just like the one that comes with your Black & Decker tool. Will also work with the DeWalt tools that are the same voltage and footprint. I use the DeWalt charger with mine. Price is well worth getting a new battery here and you may save some not using DeWalt. No use going generic if you can get Black & Decker.
1,Cr*p & Decker,"Went to replace the battery on my Black and Decker drill cuz the battery died. Ordered a new one from Amazon, charged it up fully and.....crickets. Slow power. Bad battery. Waste of my hard earned cash. Cr*p & Decker, I'm through with your cheap Chinese knock-off products (Anything that requires a battery). It's clear to me all you care about is your profits and selling cheap junk to the American consumer. I absolutely LOVE my new DeWalt cordless drill. I it....um..... works?People, do not buy this item."
1,A waste of money,"I bought this battery only four months ago, used it only a few times (no kidding) in my Black & Decker drill and now it no longer holds a charge. VERY disappointed. I wasted my money buying what I thought was a quality battery that would last a few years, at least. It's not a knock-off but a B&D battery! Hopefully Amazon will do the right thing and refund my money. Do not think you're getting a battery that will last and that B&D makes good batteries. Save your money and buy your batteries from another manufacturer."
5,Works good,This is a hard to find battery. I got one from another company before but had a hart time doing it. This wa much faster and better.
4,The only way to get this battery,"This is a rechargable battery for a 15 year old Black and Decker cordless drill. The old battery was not holding a charge and the replacement is no longer sold in stores. The only sources appear to be B&D and Amazon, and Amazon is half the price! It was considerably cheaper than buying a new drill."
3,Please don't bother buying this item!,"I am an engineer and have owned a lot of battery operated drills. I have two of these and 3 batteries. When new, this low power drill was fine for a lot of small jobs. However, the batteries have not lasted long and no longer hold a charge at all. The price of the batteries alone does not justify the cost of buying them, since you can now buy a 14.4 volt or higher drill with 2 batteries and charger for just a little more. You will have more power.If you just like this drill for some reason, then 25 bucks for a replacement battery is not a bad deal. It is just that there are so many better drills with better power now available.Listen to the other reviewers who are recommending other drills.I will be buying a different drill and getting rid of my two."
3,Worn Out Batteries?,"I love this cordless tool set, it does everything. I realy need the jigsaw tip right now but the batteries both willl not take a charge. Did these new bateries solve the problem? No, it appears the charger has died. Now I'll order a charger and will have 4 batteries. That'll keep it going for a while."
3,warranty,"I am trying to find a battery charger for this type battery and can't seem to find one. Our drill is not been used much at all and now we need a charger. If anyone knows where we could get one I sure would appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks in advance.We loved having the drill in our home for the convience but, without a charger it is no good to us. We have 2 batteries but, no way to charge them."
5,Retailers do not keep item in stock,"so happy to find replacement battery ""AND"" at such a reasonable price + no s/hThank you, AMAZON"
1,very disappointed,I purchased two of these anklets for my daughters and both anklets fell apart within a few days of wearing them.
1,Works,I have to say it works fine but I have water and condensation on the inside of the gauge I don't anticipate it lasting very long
3,Gas guage,It was good fast service - the only problem is that the sending unit does not show the amount of fuel properly(wrong amount in the tank)
3,Black & Decker VersaPak - vp650 Multipurpose Saw!,"Black & Decker VersaPak - vp650 Multipurpose Saw! I own and enjoy most of the B&D VersaPak tools. I use them in my laboratory to do light duty hobby activities. I purchased the B&D VersaPak vp650 Multipurpose saw to have a power tool for light duty actions. Since receiving my vp650 a few days ago, I have used it to cut cardboard, fiberboard and plexiglass. It has accomplished these tasks as expected. A point of notation. I would suggest using Black & Decker or Dewalt blades. I found others in my supply to thick. They would have likely been stuck in the unit. I give this unit an average rating in comparison to other B&D VersaPak tools."
4,Good to have,"This is a good addition to your small projects tool list. I used it on small wood planks about 1"" thick and it performed well. I find that if you cut tree branches over 1"" in diameter, you are better off using a dedicated tree/hedge trimmer. The processes is rather slow. The great advantage is you can get it in fairly tight places for fix-it cuts etc. There are many different blade accessories for cutting metal, nails, masonry etc. There is a good saftey feature incorperated- if you drop it or let go for any reason, it shuts itself off."
2,"Corn Syrup, Rice Crisps, and Partially Hydrogenated Oils","I'm in the Army and have these things all the time in Iraq. I wish we had a different option because these have corn syrup (first ingredient), crisp rice (cheap and empty filler and the second ingredient), and also partially hydrogenated oils (bad for you and also cheap). Some people assume that if it is a military approved item that it must be good. Not so. The military is all about cheap but effective solutions. Is this an effective energy bar? Yes. Is it good for you in the long term (especially when compared to other bars)? No."
2,The label gives it away.,"Ingredients are listed largest amount to smallest amount. The first two ingredients in this bar are sugars. That might explain some people calling them ""suprisingly good"" and ""slightly addictive"" ;-) No thank you. There are better choices out there."
2,highly disapointing,"there are some great pics in this book. However, there is hardly a caption here and there. No written material to speak of. It's a big Picture Book and should be labelled as such. RIP Larry u r missed"
5,what can one say?,"so simple and pure, told through the eyes of child's memory of something so horrific, we are all so lucky that Sam Harris has finally told his story. This story touches the heart on so many levels, and I had to put the book down so often, just to be with my emotions. Its an important story."
5,Best Sega Game Ever,"Like this game, brings back old memories of my childhood. in great shape for being used. Works fine, we play with it like we did when we were kids"
5,TJ & Earl,This is one of the most original games I have ever played. It offers an interesting storyline and multi- levels and is just plain out fun.
1,a waste of time,"It is a diffcult reading for most readers I guess.Don't buy it,unless you buy it for the library."
1,It's Jammin' (not due to Bob Marley...),Everyone in the pharmacy department has jammed this stapler at least once/daily - and that is a lot of frustrated jammin'. We have loaded it with Swingline brand staples and still no improvement. Save your money. Invest in Bob Marley...
4,Big brother,"The shape, texture and feel are akin to Powerbars, but I find the HOOAHs to be tastier and a bit softer."
3,not a HOOAH bar,"taste like your typical energy bar, nothing special about this mix of soy protein and vitamin enriched ingredients. I am Infantry veteran and I would probably enjoy this bar during a long forced march. Better than getting out a full MRE."
5,best bar out there,"Since I heard about the hooah bar several months ago, I have been relying on it - in both flavors - to supplement my busy schedule. I need quick, efficient, good-for-me meals. I've tried most bars on the market and couldn't stand either (1) the taste, (2) the texture, (3) the price, or (4) the aftermath of those other bars (some bars left me hungry or just disatisfied, other bars gave me an unsettling rush ... ) The hooah bar tastes great, goes along well with morning coffee/tea, is reasonably-priced compared to many bars and actually provides me the meal-replacement sustenance I need. I love them! (I would recommend the apple cinnamon for breakfast and the chocolate crisp for afternoon snacks.)"
2,Sugar High Does NOT Equal Energy,"The first ingrediant in these bars is ""Corn Syrup"" which is one of the most highly processed sweeteners known to man. Nutritionists will unanimously tell you to avoid Corn Syrup completely.Does Hooah! give you a feeling of energy? Sure! But so does a Snickers. It's called a sugar high.For a healty nutritious bar that won't necessarily give you a rush but will provide long lasting energy check out Clif Bars or LaraBars instead."
2,"""Hooah!"" is not even printed on the packaging!","The package I received says ""Soldier Fuel"" (not ""Hooah!"") and I was really disappointed by that. I thought it was funny & neat so I bought it, but I did not get what was advertised."
2,Made with Palm Oil,"I see no reason other than profit that the manufacturer would use cheap palm oil in a product being marketed as a health food. One bar has 25% of the maximum saturated fat you should get in one day. Why not substitute a monosaturated fat that will lower cholesterol rather than use one that raises it?I also don't need it to be loaded with vitamins and minerals as they are easily taken in a daily pill. Additionally, the texture is like day-old uncooked brownie mix. But it tastes OK relative to other health food bars I've tried and has 10 mg of protein which is good.Might I recommend instead Clif Bars that taste better, cost almost 1/3 less per ounce, have 70% less saturated fat, 60% more fiber, less calories in a bigger bar, and taste better."
5,Not Just a gimmick,"After all the good reviews of these I had to give em a try. Not only do they taste great, they work! I had my first one 20 hours into a 30 hour day and that dreary exhaustion went away almost immediately. I just wouldn't recommend eating one before bed because, not sure if its just me but I get a coffee like pep out of these things...good stuff!"
5,"Great taste, sustained energy","As avid hikers and backpackers in the Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, my partner and I have tested a wide spectrum of trail snacks to avoid ""running out of jam"" on long, strenuous hikes and climbs. By far, the Soldier Fuel bar has proven the best for sustaining our energy. On half-day training climbs, or week-long treks in the mountains, we have come to depend on Soldier Fuel bars to keep our endurance up.As an added benefit, they taste great. My hiking partner's dogs also love them, and always start begging for bits as soon as we start to tear open the wrappers."
4,Great For Emergencies,"I get these to put in my emergency kit, car and at work just in case and even though they are a bit pricey they do taste great (peanut butter) and give you a lot of energy for a small bar. Like any bar they get mushy in the heat but don't melt which is good here in the desert. I don't think the chocolate would do so well in the heat but I can't say for certain as I haven't dared try.I recommend them but admit the cost is high."
4,Great Deal!,"If you're a fan of Bing Crosby, this is a great deal! If you bought each of these separately, it would cost you ... You save almost ... These movies have a great time range, from 1934 to 1940 to 1944 to 1948. They each have a very different, fun sort of plot, and, of course, lots of singing!"
3,condition not soo true,this book was descibed as very good condition and it was far from it. The book was supposed to come with a cd and it did not. This book had quite alot of highlighting in it. It was also wore more than the seller claimed.The one thing that was true was that it did arrive in the 12 day period that was supposed to.
2,"History is good, typos are bad","I recently had to use this book for a class on basic legislation relating to the aviation community. The history about the creation of the American aviation industry and regulation is interesting. On a whole the author doesn't dive too deep into it all, rather touches on major points in the history as needed for this basic introduction. The largest let down though is the self-check modules that are provided with the CD-ROM. There are numerous typos in both the book and supplied modules. It lead to confusion with a number of students on my class, because while trying to answer some of the modules the book had a different spelling or didn't even mention a subject that was being asked in the module."
1,Aviation and the role of Government,"I'll just say this product was ordered 6 Mar, it was supposed to have been delivered on 30 Mar 09, it is now 6 Apr 09 and I still have not received my product, as I'm approaching week 3 of my class."
1,POOR SERVICE,THEY WOULDN'T SEND ITEM I ORDERED THEY SAID THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND LISTED THE WRONG ITEM.
5,No Maggie Thatcher and No government!!!!,"I love this album. There are a lot of good songs that can really get in your head and makes you want to listen to it over and over again. 24 hours, hell, no government, and Iggy Pop's cover of I wanna be your dog are excellent. the only thing I would do is that if the captain oi version is avaliable, get that instead only because their is other stuff on that that isn't on this."
2,Problems as early as Chapter 2,"Haven't gotten too far into this book yet. Almost gave up on the whole book just based on my experiences in Chapter 2. It is full of errors. The calls to the lookups have the parameters in the wrong order in listing 2.1 and 2.2. The instructions in chapter 2 are confusing and hard to follow. You shouldn't mix Sql 7 and 2000 together. They should be in separate sections.He references a task on page 36 that doesn't even exist. I spent a whole day trying to interpret what I was really supposed to do. I finally did so, but someone needs desperately to edit this chapter. As I get further into this book, I will update this review. Hopefully, it will improve as I go thru it."
3,"Although useful, the book needs a revision.","This book does not provide examples of sufficient quality and number. Examples lack in the explanation of the master plan and the end result, as well as the specifics of the data models involved.In fact, those examples that are there, have errors, especially Chapter 2.Although useful, the book needs a revision."
2,Where's the Beef?,"This one is strictly for amateurs. Perhaps the last section on customized Visual Basic programming is better. The first 4/5 ths of the book are Very Superficial. No details at all. I cannot believe a team of ""high-powered Sql Server experts"" came up with this cotton candy. Okay for an introduction if nothing else."
2,Hard To Follow and has Errors,"Catherine is right. I tried to work through Chapter 2 which was touted as buildig a ""simple"" package. The package was simple but I spent hours on it trying to follow poorly laid out directions and missing parts. Chapter 2 needs a redo so that one heads into the rest of the book with confidence in the authors."
5,Not for DBAs,"If you are a DBA who wants all the nitty gritty about DTS, this isn't your book. However, if you are programmer (with some DBA credentials) this will compliment Microsoft's help & documentation nicely. For example, someone trying to create their own custom task with Visual Basic will find Chapter 16 pretty useful. Moreover, if you needed to create a VB application to load up an XML document...All in all, a good read for the programmer wanting to work DTS."
4,"very fun, not for rough play","My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though."
1,"Cheap, don't waste your money","The shuttle bay door will fall off in no time. The booster rockets will be next. The ability to stand it up on the launch pad will last a few days at best. And the robot arm is cheap garbage. This is my experience with a 4 year old boy, but it applies to all ages."
2,Not built for the regular play of 5-9 year old kids,"The Shuttle was a good size, and my son has fun making the booster rockets fall off as it takes off, but I live in fear of the little plastic tabs that hold them on the shuttle breaking off. The set came with no instructions, so I have yet to figure out how the Satellite arm assembles and works. One of the wheels came off the shuttle in the first week (my son specifically requested a Shuttle with wheels, so he could land it). While we were able to get it on, it continues to fall off. They just did not make this ""playable"" for the kids who would be most interested ... 5-9 year olds."
2,Fun Toy,My son loved this toy and was so excited when he first opened it. Unfortunately it is not as durable as it looks. The only part that has survived after 3 months use is the shuttle minus one door. The shuttle is made of heavy metal but the rest is cheap plastic. It sure was fun for him while it lasted.
5,Three for three,"Act of God is the author's third novel and like the previous two is a five star read. Once again, Ms. Sloan has produced a fast paced novel about a contemporary social problem which attracts the reader's attention and requires the reader to examine preconceived assumptions. While the plot concerns the bombing of a medical clinic, which performs abortions as part of its services, and while the book scrupulously examines both sides of the abortion debate, the book is not about abortion. Instead it is an examination of the consequences when both sides loss all sense of civility and proportion and resort to extra-legal measures and extreme rhetoric. My only criticism is that Ms. Sloan is so successful in creating her characters, in describing the ripple effects of the act of terror which is at the core of the novel and in recreating the trial the that I was let down by the ending."
5,Excellent,What a great read from beginning to end and I will definitely be reading more by this author very very good
2,"Courtroom fiction, just like all the others","Someone else reviewed this book as ""dull"". A very good description. It wasn't a bad read, just dull. There are a zillion legal and/or courtroom fiction books these days, and this is just another one of them.I don't need to describe the gist of this story, many other people already did.Susan Sloan does much better than this with her other books."
3,Not as GOOD as her first one (Guilt by Association),"If this is the first book of Susan Sloan's that you read, this would be an interesting reading. If you had read every books of hers like I did, I have to say ""enough is enough"". Although not a bad book, the author rely too much on the same last minute twist for the surprise.Although I still think that her first book (Guilt by Association) is one of the greatest legal thriller of ninieties, this book coudn't lived up to the expectation.I thought her second book was finished about 50 pages short to fully explain the ending. This one is total nonsense. The ending has almost nothing to do with the story line and it almost felt like she put it there just to finish the book abd told us who the criminal was. After two consecutive disappointment from her (Isolated incident, and this), I am not sure I will buy another book of hers. Well I probably will, but my expectation won't be that high this time around. Only I hope that she will prove me wrong."
2,Boring,"I think I am going to be in the minority but I found this book rather dull. I was completely unsurprised by the ending and the plot twists within the story seemed too predictable. I could not understand what the accused wife's affair had to do with the plot at all. Maybe I have read too many books like this and I am beginning to think like the authors!I did think Sloan did a good job of showing the complete picture - the grief of the survivors and families, the need for the police to catch someone, the political climate, etc."
4,This was a good movie,"This movie was good and I like the singing at the end. There were a few fuzzy hiccups in the video, but I was still able to watch the whole movie."
4,Gives Russian mathematicians their due,"Tensor and vector analysis in a Euclidean space gives very elegant and powerful tools for the study of physical systems. Most of the papers in this book will be of interest to physicists. The emphasis is not so much on pure mathematics, but on studying real problems in physics. Quite possibly, engineers dealing in control systems theory and complex dynamical systems may also benefit from some papers.The book is useful at a graduate and postgraduate level, in bringing forth ideas that go well beyond the standard graduate texts on this subject.It also helps gives Russian mathematicians their proper due outside Russia. During the Cold War, their contributions were often unknown outside the Soviet Bloc."
1,"Good god, RECALL THIS ALBUM AT ONCE!","All you need to know about this tribute album is that some idiot covered Lay Lady Lay. Jesus, people, if you're gonna pay tribute to Ministry, try remaking songs that they actually WROTE! Horrible. Unoriginal sound makes this album sound like it's an insult rather than a tribute."
2,Waste of Cash,"Ministry is one of the titanic god fathers of the industrial music scene. However, the fodder that contributed to this album did little more than do lame covers of Ministry's lamest songs. The roster does include a few worthwhile bands such as PIG and umm...err..Yeah, and that song is probably the worst. The mixing for the most part is week and typical and the hellish 80s synth that marked Ministry's early style hasn't distanced itself much. Simply put, this album just isn't worth the cash."
2,Don't Waste The Cash,"Tribute albums usually tend to offer 3 or 4 good covers, and a bunch of lousy ones. Well, this is no exception. Meg Lee Chin's cover of Scarecrow is fine, Pig's cover of Just Like You is surprisingly mediocre (well, even geniuses have bad days I guess), and the Hate Dept. cover of Effigy is a tad too overdramatic. These are the best of the lot, though Everyday Is Halloween still bounces as it should, though this track (as well as most of the others) suffer from unfortunately self-conscious production, a problem which has reared its ugly head too often in the genre."
4,Not perfect but most tracks are really good.,"I was never a big Ministry fan, but I like this album a lot. There a few standout tracks like Meg Lee Chin's ""Scarecrow"" and TRS-80's version of ""Everday is Halloween"". I also really like ""Lay Lady Lay"" but it is strange to see a cover of a cover. I wish someone covered ""Work for Love"" but overall it is a good listen."
1,Did not receive,"I'd love to review the CD, but the order never made it to my home and I wound up with a refund. I've heard individual tracks on different occasions and I really enjoyed the tributes. I especially enjoy the ""Scarecrow"" tribute. Good stuff!"
4,good stuff,"Very good approach to teaching Indonesian. Use of the accompanying CD rom, or work with a native speaker is essential to get the most out of this text, however."
5,"If you are a McMahon in Rhode Island, this is a great book.","I am the auhor of his book. This is a genealogy of the McMahon family as decendant from Patrick McMahon who arrived in Rhode Island in about 1870.I have only had 3 copies of this book printed: 1 for my family, 1 for the Library of Congress and 1 for the Irish Family Research Center in Monaghan Ireland. Beware of anyone who tells you they have a ""used"" copy of this book. It's simply not true.Timothy E. McMahonExecutive EditorNortheast Book Reviewstim_mcmahon@northeastbookreviews.com"
1,Disappointing...,"If you think ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is funny, and that's the kind of comedy you want to do, then this might help. I personally don't care for that. I was just looking for something to help me generate ideas on how to think on my feet as a public speaker. I didn't really find anything useful in this book for neither public speaking nor stand up. This only seems to be geared toward group comedy.I don't know what all the good reviews are about."
1,Good place to Start,"This is not a difficult book to read and gives a fair list of new games that I had never played before. A lot of the games would be quite useful in developing certain skills like physicality etc, but the book doesn't touch on some of the bigger concepts in Impro like Status. Also there is a lot of name dropping and patting on the back, which might add a slight authority to the book, but ultimately doesn't really teach you anything. Still, I got a bit out of it, so it is worth a look."
2,Terrible binding!,"I loved this book, but the binding literally fell apart after a day. Get it from the library if you can!"
5,Textbook for Improv class,"This book is used as the textbook for long for improv at the Pan Theater in Oakland.This book is far more ""compact"" than I thought, and is a quicker read than some of the other books out there. This should probably be one of the first books you buy on ""improv"" concepts."
2,If who you know makes you funny...,"the author of this book is a laugh riot. I had a hard time getting past the name dropping and self congradulatory, over the top story telling. The information that comes later in the book is pretty good, having studied with some of the people Ms. Halpern refers to as if she gave them birth. You are never, however, going to learn the ""Harold"" from a book. Go take a class and get out on stage. Stage time is everything."
5,The Review,"I've been doing improv comedy on and off for about two years now, and I can honestly say that this book is the best one I've read on the topic. Reading Truth in Comedy is the next best thing to actually being on stage. Now I find myself ""looking for the game"" in a given scene and doing other such techniques advised by Charna Halpern and Del Close; two veterans, to say the least, of improv. I've read the book three times now and every time I pick up something new, it's just a book that keeps on giving! Besides being very informative this book also is quite entertaining. I recomend buying this book whether you have and interest in improv or not."
4,great for beginners,"I found this book to be very easy reading. I enjoyed it very much. When looking for basic information, easily understoodfor a beginner, this book is wonderful. It teaches the very basics of courteous play with another improvisor, or a group.I love the Herold!Enjoy!Lynn"
2,Truth in comedy,"Having a bit of trouble wading through the issue of how much better this method is than any other form of improv on the planet. Gets very old, and makes me want to put the book down, which is finally what I did. Can't imagine why it is necessary to continually inform the reader of the value of the stylistic differences, and the superiority of this method. Didn't Shakespeare have something to say about this need?"
3,Pretty decent,"This game is fairly entertaining, with each level being different and bosses like the Sandman, Lizard, HobGoblin, Venem, & ultimately the Kingpin. Swinging around on webs is pretty fun, and you can make a web shield and if your energy is low you can go home and rest for a bit. The game is timed, so you don't have a certain amount of lives. Where it went wrong, for me at least, is in the end where you essentially have to disable a bomb by entering different keys when their corresponding color flashes. It's pretty frustrating when you mess up and the timer starts running faster and then the bomb goes off and you have to start back at the beginning. If you do disable the bomb, which I have only accomplished 2 or 3 times, then you get your butt kicked by the Kingpin."
5,Best Black Sabbath album of the 90's - Best effort post-ozzy osbourne,"Amazing CD productionAmazing CD Black Sabbath 90's soundBest Ronnie James Dio effort with Black SabbathSadly, it was a short reunion-period for this Sabbath lineup."
5,Great purchase!,"I'm 60 some years old and decided I wanted to learn to play the guitar. I make most of my purchases on Amazon. This is a great package. everything you need to learn to play. Great learning instructions. Beside the DVD, they give you a website to download an instruction book. Although I haven't gotten very far, I'm sure this will work. The guitar sounds great. Looks great. Sturdy. Comes with everything you need."
3,good value,Battery is good value for money would have been $20- $30 dollars more in NZdoes the job just fine
4,Battery - so far/so good,Battery price was reasonable.Shipping was fast. So far the battery has been workingwell and holding a charge. I wish there there were a cheap Li-Onoption for this drill.Overall I would recommend this battery and vendor.
3,Black & Decker 14.4volt Ni/Cad Battery,This is a typical replacement battery only this one has not ever held a charge for very long. It's a disappointment.
3,Replacement,This battery charged just fine but the fit is too tight to remove from the drill housing without a huge effort. I was disappointed that Black & Decker would make such a mistake.
5,Good price,I purchased two batteries. They gave new life to my hedgetrimmer. Now I can work for quite a while before recharging.
1,where is it?,"I am sure this product would have worked fine, but I never received the product from the company. I ordered two separate types of battery..I received the one battery, but not this one. I have emailed the company to try and resolve this but I am getting very little satisfaction. It has been almost two weeks and I have not actually heard from Razorback yet. good luck!"
2,Get what you pay for with this battery,"Worked well for about a year of average use, then started having to recharge more often - drilling 4 to 5 3/8"" holes through a 2x4 stud would about drain it - and now, 2 years later, if left unused for a day after a full charge up it drains almost dead and must be recharged - and I get very short time use out of it - suspect it will be dead in a few months - I'll self ""refurb"" it, but find that will only last about 3-6 months and then it will be a paper weight. Would not recommend this battery for field use or heavy duty use, best keep it around the shop with a charger near by. I've since bought a better battery for my 15+ year old BD FS drill, which BTW has taken a good lickin' over the years and still working great."
1,busted battery,got the battery in a timely manner. took it out and charged it over night. died in about 3 minutes...did not hold the charge...so disappointed :-(
4,SOME FACTS ABOUT FIRESTORM POST BATTERIES,"Remember you get what you pay for. I have been told that a battery which goes bad can destroy a charger. Some of the previous comments indicate this may have taken place when they switched a non-charging battery to a new charger and burned out both chargers.The 14.4 post charger can be found on ebay, and reliabletools.com where I bought mine.Dewalt 14.4 batteries will work in OLD STYLE - post type (not the new slide type) tools.Batteries must be fully drained each time to avoid imprinting.Charge for full time requirement, usually 3 hrs., for the old style firestorm charger.Unplug charging unit when not in use to extend life of charger.I have seen Dewalt batteries, Firstorm batteries (post style) and dewalt chargers at Lowes hardware.I have aquired these rules from destroying my own tools and searching for replacement tools. Hope this helps."
3,Battery Charger,I have the Drill And the saw and was pleased with them both until my charger went bad. I cannot find another charger and do not feel I should have to buy another kit to obtain a charger. From the other reviews I see that I am not the only one with this problem. I have worked construction for 25 years and I would still rate the old 12 volt Dewalt slightly above this because battery life seemed longer.
4,It works,Reacts well to the quick charger. Holds a charge well. Powerful enough for about an hour of hedge clipping.
1,Chargers,"My charging unit went to crap, so I go to the local Bi-Mart where I bought my Fire Storm kit, and they tell me they cant order the charger! I called the B&D 1-800 # and it's all automated good luck! Checked the web site and they refer me to hardware stores and well they dont have the way to get the re-charger...... Review good battery if charged!!!"
1,Displeasure,"I'm not able to tell whether it works or not, as the charger for this system died. The replacement charger I ordered direct from B&D was the wrong one, and the replacement for that apparently isn't working either. I'm having such fun with this."
5,battery black and decker,"I have been having difficulty understanding the charge made to myt bank account on May 29, 2011. I have not purchased anything since the battery purchased on April 27,2011. The charge was for $79.00 and taken directly from my account without my knowledge. I am happy with the battery and it functions well, I would appreciate the return of the charge on May 29. Thank you for your efforts.RespectfullyPatrick Boatman"
3,dissapointed,"your page says it fits all Firestorm 14.4 volt tools, however I havea B&D firestorm reciprocating 14.4 volt saw and uses adofferent battery although the number is the same ie PS140. When I returned it yolu said it was not your fault and i had to pay shipping charges. I don`t think it was my fault either."
4,Replacement B&D 14.4V Battery,I bought to replace the original batteries that came with my Black & Decker cordless set. Battery works great. Great Price on Amazon.
5,great product,Great replacement for a battery that gave me 5 years of good service. I'm looking forward to 5-10 more.
2,Didn't solve my problem,Sometimes it just ain't the battery - or maybe it's a bad product. Can't tell. Ended up with a new machine.
5,It works,This battery works just as good as the originals. Holds a charge for a long time and has the power I need.
3,battery,"It is ridiculous that a battery cost as much as a new product. I hate to see all these modern products added to the landfills because it is cheaper to buy new than replace parts, so I bought the battery hopefully to help save the enviornment."
5,B&D PS140 Battery,This is a pretty good battery. This is my second and they holdup well. My first one has lasted five years and still going. Purchased this one to give me a backup for my hedge trimmers.
2,What a piece of crap,"I'm stuck with this black and decker hedge hog trimmer. I never got any real use from it. The batteries die with less than 10 minutes of use. You can't cut branches thicker than a pencil. I contacted black and decker and they sent me a free battery charger, but I hate the tool. I'm afraid the battery or charger will catch on fire because the charger gets so hot with the battery in place."
3,FireStorm 14.v Battery,"The 14.4V battery and Charger work perfectly.Now, I am armed with charged battery for the hedge trimmer...."
4,Does the Job !,Needed a replacement for my B & D drill what is a least 7 yrs old. Best price and OEM found on Amazon. Recommend this method for replacement
3,Doesn't Last for 300 Charges,"I got my cordless drill a number of years ago (probably at least 7). It came with 2 batteries and when one ran out, I would use the full one and recharge the other so that I always had something.In the few years, my drill has had very little power, barely enough to drive in a screw, even when I used a newly charged battery. It also runs out quickly. There is no way I've charged each battery 300 times; maybe closer to 30. I guess batteries go over time.I'll probably end up buying new batteries. The hardware stores (like Ace and Home Depot) sell them. Amazon's prices are way better than any I've found on Ebay, especially with free shipping. If they are cheaper than the stores, I'll order from Amazon."
1,Using Dewalt Batteries for B&D Saws,I took the advise of one of the other reviewers who stated that the Dewalt DC 9091 was the same thing as the PS140. It isn't! It did not fit my Firestorm Circular Saw. It would not clip into place as it was bigger around than the PS140.
4,Hmmmmmm,"These books are interesting, but EXTREMELY unrealistic.Massie is SO immature. She is in 7th grade and has NEVER kissed a boy! ALso, she has only 4 friends? Pul-leeze. She is NOT popular. Also, not even super rich girls would spend 600 on a top."
1,What shame,"I TOTALLY AGRRE WITH KEOLA88 or whatever. but it was quite a DISSAPOINTMENT. I thought it was going to be another gossip girl, or A-list... (because im a fan... and i have to read stuff inbetween when those books come out) But instead, its about 7th graders... SICK SICK SICK. IM A HIGHSCHOOLER."
2,Rich Girls are NOT Snobs,"Um yeah okay, so like, why are rich girls always portraied as rich, selfish, snobs??? Ok, I happen to be rich and I'm totally NOT a snob!!! I have hundreds of friends and we're not mean to other girls like that and exclude them! I get whatever I want and I DON'T have any reason to hate other girls! We're all practickally friends, so yeah!! Mean girls was a better movie than this dumb book because at least Grechen and the dumb blonde were rich, but they were nicer. And you saw how Caddie (Lizzy Lohan) acted!!! So we rich girls should totally not be put down like that! Let's make some POOR girls snobs for once! Geez! What, just because they're poor and have no money or friends means they can't be self asorbed and creul??? Whatever... bye! You know you love me: *Alison*"
4,"Unrealistic, but thats what makes it so fun.","This was a ah-mazing book. Its about a lower-middle class girl who moves into the guest house of a rich girl, Massie. claire, the poor one, expects she will emmeditley be friends with Massie the most popular girl in the school.The only bad thing was it had some really cheesey parts. ""did i ask you to take my tempeture? Then why are you all up my butt?"" and if a girl in seventh grade called a present a prezzy she would get her butt kicked. mabey in canada or whereever lisi harrison grew up it was cool to say that stuff but today totally its not.Yes, i admitt that it is realistic that massie and her possey's closets full of deisiner clothes, but thats what makes this book so fun!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!"
5,I great boook!,"I really enjoyed The Clique, im ?? and i think that it shows greatly in detail look at the life of a rich girls, living in the Westchester/ New York City area. Massie and Alicia are my favorite characters, even though A is a total AIRHEAD!"
3,The Clique,"Overall, this book was pretty good, although there were some aspects of it that I didn't really like. At first, I thought that The Clique would be as good as GossipGirl, one of my favorite series, but I didn't even come close! The first big problemis the age group. The Clique is clearly aimed at, like, 8th-12th graders, but what high school girl wants to read about a bunch of 7th graders? This book is best for 9-12 year olds, but not many 4th graders care about couture and boys! Most of them probably don't even know who Manolo Blahnik is! And it's pretty unrealistic that 7th graders would have Louis Vuittons, or Jimmy Choos, like I didn't get my first pair of Choos until 8th grade! The characters are kind of immature, too. This book is best for younger girls, who are not allowed, too young, or not mature enough to read the GossipGirl books.:)"
3,"It's junk, it's unrealtistic, it's annoying...but so addictive!","I read this book as a joke, because my sister had just finished reading it and I wanted to see how stupid it was. I mean c'mon, how unoriginal can the title get? ""The Clique""? Needless to say, the book was addicting, but at the same time, a complete waste of time to read. For one thing, it's so unrealistic and portrays very materialistic characters. Second, it seems like an excuse just for the author to show off her knowledge of designer brands and typical teen slang(which by the way, most teens, including me, don't say, e.g-""ah-dorable!""). Not to mention there are a ton of spelling errors in this book. Lastly, the plot is pretty unoriginal, if not the entire ""Clique"" series package. If you want good teen reads, look somewhere else."
5,The Clique Review,"This book is the best! i read this book in 1 day because it was full of excitement and tense senes. im sure you will love this book as much as i did! its about this girl named massie and her life is great! shes rich and gets everything she wants when suddenly a girl named claire comes into the picture, shes a visitor from florida and is staying with massie! and there are some problems between them and its just basicly massie's life with claire in the picture. its the best book i have ever read and im sure you will love this book and would want to read the other books that follow! ENJOY!!!"
5,Is this another a clueless?,"Claire Lyons: A thirteen year old girl from Florida who just moved Weschester, Ny with her parents old college buddies. They have one daughter, the queen bee of Octavian Day School. She is pure evil and and has her own ""Clique"" of girls who adore her. Claire struggles to be in the ""Clique"". Massie and the girls play dirty tricks on Claire. Does that stop her? Claire is determined to get in the ""Clique"" . Will she ever be in the ""Clique"" ? Massie has alot on her hands."
5,The Clique by Lisa Harrison,"The clique is a really good book! It shows how it is hard to get accepted. Claire is a girl who used to live in Florida and moved to New York for her fathers job; she has to live at Massie's families guest house until her father finds them a home in New york. Claire wants to be part of the clique with Massie, Dylan, Kristin, and Alicia but they dont really want her in the group. She trys hard to be accepted by them she sneaks in Massie's room and plays with her IM's, she lies to get ""gossip points"" and she changes her style. At the end of the book Claire goes back to norimal and is friends with Layne she drops the expensive clothes and is caught for her lies and IM's."
4,clique books,"Wow!! I loved this book soooo much. It really shows what girls can be like -- catty and mean!! It got my attention right away and it was really hard to pull myself away when I was reading it in class. Definitely one of my fav books.I would have given it five stars, but I think Ms. Harrison has gotten even better after writing this book, and since I've read books 2 and 3, i know that they are a little better than this.All the same, this book rocks and i recommend it to any girl in 5th grade through high school.Great job, Ms. Harrison!!(...)"
4,Gossip Girl... for the younger set,"Basically, I picked this up for no real reason other then boredom.But it turned out to be an interesting look at the cliques that exist in the middle school years.While I have been out of both middle school and high school for several years (out of high school 5 years), I love YA books, and I did enjoy the book on some level.I will buy the follow up book if only because the characters intrigue me, even if the subject matter is a little immature for me.Of course, if you aren't interested in the behaviour patterns of 12/13 year old girls and you are older it probably won't be a good book for you.But if you have a little sister, this might keep her out of your books...."
1,ick,"ick! don't ever buy them! they're a waste of money and your precious time! i hate them! HATE them! ICK, GET THEM AWAY FROM ME!"
1,Pathetic,"This book was just bad...bad bad bad bad bad. I found myself laughing almost all the way through it, not becuase it was funny, but because it was so very, very pathetic. Every single character annoyed me, the plot annoyed me, heck, I'll just go right ahead and say the whole entire book annoyed me. It was an unrealistic look at middle school cliques. The characters were weak and had no personality, they were all the same annoying person to me. It makes me wonder what the authors middle school life was like, because mine was and is worlds apart from what is portrayed in this awful book. Don't buy this book, don't read this book, if you want a good teen novel then go look at some of Sarah Dessen's works, or someone else who is actually better at writing than chatspeak."
1,OMG. What crap!,"Normally I like almost every book I read. This is true with very little exceptions. Maybe I just don't get it or maybe this isn't the style for me but after reading this book, I seriously felt a little bit dumber. This is a book about a bunch of stuck up brats who's insignifigant little problems somehow claim the attention of everyone around them. Maybe I'm wrong and you'll like this Mean Girlsesque book. It appears you certainly wouldn't be alone but frankly it insulted my intelligance."
2,Imitation Gossip Girl at its worst...,"'The Clique' is an imitation 'Gossip Girl'-type book poorly done. I suppose it is understandable if you are within the age range of ten to twelve and you enjoyed it. Why write a book targeted towards such a small group? First of all, there is not as much you can write about, because, face it, what can twelve/thirteen-year-olds do that can provide an incredibly interesting plot? It isn't that appealing to read about kids. I guess I could recommend this to anyone that fits in the previously stated age group, but any older...don't pick up this book, it will leave you extremely disappointed and pissed off (if you spent money to actually buy it)."
1,"Yuck, who wants to read about 7th Grade?","I'm sorry to the author, but this was just a disappointing book. First of all, after I picked this book up to read, I found out that it was about seventh graders. But who wants to be reminded of that time of life? It's terrible, and not fun to read about. The characters are also unpleasant and flat, not at all real or believable. Seventh graders being that mean and spending that much on clothes? I suppose it happens, but who wants to read about it? Poorly written about a bad subject choice, this book is not recommended."
5,Really great book!,"i loved this book. so far i've read up to sealed with a diss, book 7 in the clique series. i think that all middle school girls (including myself) can easily relate to this book and the rest of the awesome series. they can relate to cliquey mean girls, trying to fit in with the ""cool kids"", trying to wear the right clothes, and many other things that normal middle school girls go through. i highly reccomend this book to any girl, going through any type of social situation in school - good or bad. :D"
5,LOVE IT,"Im only like 1/4 of the way through, and i can say that it is by far one of the best books ever!!It is really funny and relates to real girl world!"
5,THE CLIQUE IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!,"How many times have I thought about situations like this? I loved this book so much! All of my friends(we're in eighth grade in NJ. . . snore) are attracted to the interesting cover and story line. I keep having to let a new person practically every day bum this book off of me.For anyone who is looking for a good laugh, read this book. SAVE YOURSELF AND READ IT!!! YOU DON""T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN MISSING! I can't even count how many times I let my mouth hang open during the twists, and laughed out loud!Read the Second book! For those of you who already have, #3 comes out in May 2005, title: REVENGE OF THE WANNABEES. . . how appropriate."
4,The Clique,"The clique is a very good book to read. It keeps you on your feet and is exciting. This book is about a girl. Her name is Claire Lyons.She and her family don't have alot of money ,so they move into there father's bosses guest house. Claire and her brother have to go to a new school. Claire trys to fit in with the daughter of the boss. But the daughter,Massie is to rich and snotty to even care about her. This is great book if you enjoy hard times with girls."
5,very clique material,"In the book the Clique, Lisi Harrison explains how hard it can be in middle school with a leading clique (Massie Block, Alicia Rivera, Dylan Marvil, and Kristen Gregory), EW's-Eternal wannabees (inside joke in book) and people who just want to get by but secretly long to be in Massie's inner circle, Clair Lyons for example is one of those people.She was born and raised in Orlando,Florida but her dad is looking for a job so she is staying in Massie's guest house because Claire's dad and Massie's dad were colledge buddies.But Massie Rejects Claire because of where she shops, what she wears, and her squeaky anoying keds. But will Massie warm up to Claire? And what is Kristen hiding? This Clique is about to get a whole lot more Complicated but can Massie take it?"
1,iv considered this book but under my circumstances...,"""eh maw gawd""k this book has torn me and my best friend apart cuz now shes starting to act popular (which she isnt btw) and its all about dressing in retarted ""fashionalbe"" clothes that would make any sensible fashion designer scream. these books R STUPID and hav no sense. only a true friend could really enjoy these"
2,Stereotypical << Teenage Review,"This is a very stereotypical book. As a teenager I can ""see"" the cliques in school. However, they aren't like they are described in this book. Everyone is NOT focused on how to get into one of the cliques. This is unrealistic. In the book, girls received ""gossip points"" for the ""best"" gossip. Never in my life have I heard someone talk about getting gossip points in school. Don't bother wasting your time on this book. It isn't worth it."
5,What do you mean it wasn't good?,"THE CLIQUE ROCKSI just wanted to say that if you didn't like this book and you were fifteen, there's a reason.On the back of every book there's an age guide. This book's age guide is 9-12!! Hello, why would you read this book when you were 14 or 15?! It just makes zero sense!This book is extremely well written and has a great story line. I know a few people who have read this, and they all LOVED it. I cannot wait until the sequel comes out.*By the way, I have a Luis Vuitton, two Coach bags, a XOXO bag*And I'm not snobby! So all you people who say that it's about little rich girls that are snobby, you're wrong.THE CLIQUE ROCKS!"
4,you think parents won't let kids have credit cards??,"""The Clique"" was a glamorous book, and so easily relatable to my life. I go to a prepatory academy, and our halls are filled with credit cards, Micheals Kors blouses, Juicy Couture sidekicks, Chanel glasses, and anything and everything in this series. Starbucks has got nothing on this book series."
4,I liked it!,"This was a very good book I enjoyed. It was entertaining and well-written. I was practically sucked in the book, I read it in about a week. (I know you'd probably think I read it in like a day, but I'm a slow reader!)"
2,Stereotype!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Like ""Foster Fan"" I also live in a very,very rich area in Westchester, and the girls arent snotty, or mean or catty! And their parents don't buy them prada,louis vuitton,or burbury knapsacks! we have Jan Sport like everyone else! Also, we don't get new computerts just because we like purple more than green!"
1,HUH?????,"This has got to be one of the dumbest books ever. It's about these rich, mean, spoiled, stupid kids and how their entire pathetic lives are consumed by gossip. BORING. Reading it is torture: it feels like all your brain cells are dying. The characters are all very 'simple-minded'. For example, they love to lie and say that so-and-so's booger fell out. (They do that a lot in this book.)In the book, everyone literally worships the nasty, cruel popular girls who love talking about boogers. No one with half a brain in real life would ever look up to anyone like that. Spare your mind and avoid this book! If you love catty drama, go out and create your own, because reading about other people's boring 'drama' is just too desperate."
1,Concerned Father Review - NOT appropriate for Teen Girls,"This book promotes mean actions against other children and some are definitely inappropriate. I've read some of the book. It said who was in and who was out. It said mothers were in and fathers were out. Since young ladies (teen girls) need good male role models as well as good female role models, this book possesses the possibility to lead your daughter to disrespect her parents, but also goes against almost all the things that I have instilled into my daughters dealing with respect and how to treat others. This is Definitely NOT a good message for such impressionable little girls. I feel that some kids are MORE mature than the judgemental brats in this book. They see this stuff at school and it's already hard enough to get them to make good decisions, why would I want them to read a book like this?"
5,Really good!,"Everything in Massie's life is perfect. She has perfect hair, a great clique, and she rules the school at Octavian Country Day. until CLaire comes along. Claire is a really nice girl who just moved from orlando into the Block's guest house. she wants to be instant friends with Massie, but Massie is not so welcoming.everyone in the group is etremely mean to her, from spilling red paint on her white jeans to make it look like a period stain, to throwing food on her head. Will Massie And Claire become friends? Reead to find out.This book is seriously amazing, it describes every teens problem so easily and in detail. it was so hard to put this book down! i read it in like an hour! Everyone of Lisi Harrisons books is amazing, I recommend this entire series along with Monster High."
4,Fantastic!,I think the book was great. It was very detailed. And was perfectly written. I just gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the best book I've ever read.
5,The Clique,"I love this book and I bet you will too. I read the book The Clique. It is a really good book. This book is hilarious, exciting and nerve wracking. I recommend this book to girls all around the world. This book is about five girls. Four mean girls (Massie,Dyaln,Kristin,Alicia) and one new girl (Claire). Find out how the four girls torture Claire.This book is nerve wracking. Do you want to know why? The things they do in this book bring you in and you don't want to put the book down. For an example, what were they going to do to Claire next?This book also had some hilarious things!!! Some parts made me cry because they were so funny. The things they did to Claire were wrong, but sometimes you had to laugh.You have to read this book. It will crack you up!!!Overall this book was great. You should read it. I'll bet you will love it like I did. You will get a kick out of this book. I loved this book so much I am reading the rest of the series!!! I bet you will to after you read The Clique."
5,Talk about Prada!,"This book is something that anyone can relate to. The Clique is an outstanding book about a girl named Massie, who was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Then, her dad's old buddy and his wife, son, and daughter, Claire move into to the guesthouse until they can afford their own home. Massie and the rest of the clique are brutal to poor Claire. Will Claire survive the tortures of Westchester? Will Massie start to lighten up a bit? Read and find out!"
4,Bratty Girls Make for a Funny Book,"This book was very fun to read. The girls in this book are very rich and arrogant. They make very harsh comments on those less rich and less fashionable. The members of The Clique are Massie Block (supreme ruler of The Clique, whatever Massie does, others do), Alicia Rivera (stunningly beautiful, sometimes envies Massie), Dylan Marvil (mother is a famous talk-show host, is always on a diet), and Kristen Gregory (lets her friends pay for everything, is hard-working and smart). Claire Lyons is a new girl living with her family in Massie's poolhouse. She tries to become friends with The Clique girls. Big mistake. Massie makes Claire's life miserable. But the tables turn when Claire turns The Clique girls against Massie. Can all-powerful, permanently popular Massie get her ""friends"" back? ----Great read, funny bookD.E."
4,Very mean girls,"Crazy people are cliquers who wear knickers, they're not happy or snappy or bright!!! La,la,la,la,la, ahh!! Why do u all make me do reviews!?! (And scene)"
2,Not that good,"Lisi Harrison doesn't realize most people can't afford Juicy Couture, Prada, COach, Ralph Lauren, etc., etc. She's drilling into tweens/teens that you REALLY need to act bratty and spoiled.If you throw a fit when you don't get a job and claim to sue, (Alicia!) then call your employer and LBR, you won't get anywhere in life. Being popular isn't everything. All they care about is their ""alpha"" status and they suck up to Massie all the time. It's all about how alpha you are, id you're an LBR, your weight and your comebacks.Kinda predicatble. It's like all other series. As the series goes on, Massie gets kinda better, but it's still not worthit."
5,Just like Me,"Wow this book was great, it completely reaflected my life. I have like the same life as Massie. The only differents if well im probly a little richer and my dad isnt as cool but other then that where like twins!!! I cant belive it"
2,a bit unrealistic,"hi. i'm actually from westchester, ny, and a friend of mine read the book, and when she told me about it, i had to write about it. first of all, not all of westchester is so wealthy, maybe 1/2-3/4 of it. second, some of us people from westchester, or maybe even most, are decent people. this book is kinda steriotyping westchester as a rich, snobby place, but only parts of it reflect the clique. this reminds me of the o.c.- a basically unrealistic steriotype."
3,12 going on 35,"These girls act a bit too old for their age--watch out for a few cuss words--but it is enjoyable and fun. If you are looking for a well-written book, this isn't for you. Looking for pure enjoyment? Look no further."
1,just read my review,"so i would not say this is the best book seris ever but i wouldnt say it was the worst. there is no real way anyone who reads this book can learn anything. this is a good book if you want to read a quick book or if you dont have any other books you want to read. some people on here are saying their daughters are calling kids at school lbrs aka losers beyond repairs, but if your child is calling kids that they are probally not mature enough to read this seris. i know it is highly unlikely for tween middle school girls to be getting designer clothing, but the auther is trying to display of what she thinks a clique is. so ya thats my review....."
2,"Perpetuates ""Mean Girls""","My mother bought me this book years ago and I recently stumbled upon it and decided to just have a fun read. The author definitely has a way of pulling you in with engaging dialogue and funny acronyms. However, books like these are part of the problem of bullying, not the solution. It perpetuates the ""mean girl"" behavior and excessive materialism. Unfortunately, the book does not reflect it's readers in personality or even socio-economic status. Not everyone can afford, or even wants to, a Louis Vuitton bag or Kate Spade purse."
1,Moms...skip these,"First of all, let me say I haven't read any of Ms. Harrison's books and I'm not sure what message she is trying to convey. I do know ;however, if your 13 year old is as impressionable as mine apparently is, give this series a wide berth. By the fourth book, her clothes were not good enough, her makeup was not expensive enough, and her shoes were lame. These things were all fine before reading these books. If Ms. Harrison is shilling for some teen fashion mag by authoring these books, she is certainly doing her job. My daughter also asked me for an $800 bag!(to which I replied ""HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!) I informed her that her $35 Roxy purse could hold just as many lip glosses and love notes as could a Louis Vuitton. If you have a daughter who insists on reading these, make sure she is grounded in reality, I've obviously missed the mark in thinking that my own child was above such pettiness."
1,it was the worst book i ever read,"this book is all about bad values,popularity,and how mean girls can get."
1,Sorry!,Sorry. i think this book is for people who are mean gossips who enjoy hurting people and backstabbing. Please dont waste your money and time on this book.
5,The Clique,This is an very intrestting book about a group of girls who are best friends they had many fun memories but when they had big plans they were interrupted by a girl who was staying with one of the other girls of coures the girl in the group of other girls was verey upset and did not want her here ggggggrrrrrrrrr she was mad her whole plan was ruend but soon she will meet someone who si so asome she was stuned to see that it was the.......... cant tell you half to read this book to find out trust me u will want to read this book i of coursed loved it.Again this book is called The Cique affter u read this book you will want to read the whole series!I recome this book to all girls!!!!!!!!!!
2,If you were looking for at least slightly interesting....,"Do not read this book. It will only bore you to death. There is scarcely any character development, and really unrealistic. What 7th grade girl wears Manolo Blahnik boots? No matter how rich you are, chances are this would not be a possiblility, especially with the way Massie's mother was portrayed. It is completely cliche', with the whole ""wanting to be with the 'in crowd'"" thing. Naturally this is a common plot for books written for teens to follow, but this one does not follow that plot well. If you want a good read, read Gossip Girls, as this book is probably more fitting for 10 year olds. Sorry, but I don't want to read a book about a girl who or her 'newly sprouted A-cups.'"
5,AWSOMNESS,"I lOOOV this book it rox my sox, and its totally awsome..........ive read all three so far, and all the girls at my skewl cannot wait for the fourth.!i actually get excited for SSR at skewl now! its sad but i like the book!!HECK YESS!!!anywho i have better things to do so TATA FOR NOW""peace luv and surf naked""lata aligata"
2,Depends on what you want your kids reading....be careful,"My 10 year old tore through the first 4 books in this series (borrowed from friends) before I realized what was happening. I've never seen her read so fast in my life. While they are apparently quite entertaining to 5th graders, to me, they are trashy and mean spirited. Parents, just read them first and decide if this is what you want your daughter to be reading. I will not allow her to finish the series until she is much older."
1,This is CRAP,"Okay. First of all, this book is about girls that are,um, 11 or 12 years old. Personally, I would never want to read about little kids. It's so pointless. And the characters are probably the most annoying, stupid, unrealistic, moronic characters I was ever tormented into reading about. I mean, the whole time the stupid characters are just trying to act older than they really are. It got on my nerves. And no one calls a present a ""prezzy"" without getting their ass kicked. Prezzy? Ehmigod? I actually liked Claire better than the popular posers. But still, why was she so desperate to be in their ""clique""? I mean, a real 11 year old would find another group to hang out with. And what was with Massie thinking a 16-year-old guy liked her? My favorite part in the whole book was when she saw that 16-year-old with his wicked pretty older girlfriend. That cracked me up."
5,BEST BOOK I'VE READ!!!,This book is one of the best books I have read because it is very realistic. You get to know the main characters' point of view and why they do certain actions. You also get to know if they are feeling happy or sad. I also like the book because it is in modern day life. The author showed how the rich girl lived and the middle-class girl lived and how they don't get along very well. It ends showing that the two very diffrent girls could some how get along.
2,"Interesting, but unrealistic","I read this book, and it kept my attention, but it is very unrealistic in my opinion. There are very few schools in the US with a Starbucks inside it, and the girls are VERY cruel to the girl that moves to Massie's mansion. I don't know many girls that would leave someone out like they do because they don't own a Gucci shirt or a bottle of Chanel fragrance. I don't think it's a good influence on the age girls it's written for, as it could give them the idea that they have to own designer outfits, accessories, and cosmetics in order to be able to fit in, or worse, even treat other people wrong because they don't own this stuff. Again, it is pretty interesting when you begin to read it, but it's cruel in many parts and unrealistic."
1,Mean spirited Collection,"We purchased the Clique collection for our daughter for Christmas because she loves to read and asked us specifically for this series of books. Two weeks later we received a school detention for our daughter from the principal stating that our daughter had called someone a LBR. Guess where she learned that. See the first page of ""It's Not Easy to Be Mean"",(What does that title tell you)? LBR means, Loser Beyond Repair.These books are mean spirited, snobbish, name dropping, and petty, and if there is any type of lesson to be learned, (at least a valuable one), I could not find it. I threw every one of them out. Do not buy your children these books unless you want them to turn out like mindless twits."
3,unrealistic,"This book starting interesting but then after a while it became too fake. Nothing like this happens. There are no schools like OCD and no one is this obsessed with their social status. -- Laura, 14I am Laura's tutor and I agree -- it became overdone, exaggerated, and a little too much. But it was funny sometimes to read about how the extreme wealthy live and how lost they get in the material world."
3,Hmm.. Well,"Well.. I've read Gossip Girls, The Insiders and The Clique and what I see the difference from the clique is that it's about 7th graders. Hmmm can we say age difference. Maybe that's why some people didn't like this book if they had read the other series because it's for younger kids i.e. 10-12 year olds. Well.. Anyways. .The book was about Massie this rich, popular, snobby girl in charge of Octavian Day School (or whatever I can't really remember :P) who was in charge of a clique. Her clique made up of Dylan (Second in charge and also overly concerned about her weight), Alicia (The disgustingly beautiful and very mean girl), and Kristen ( What can I say.. another mean girl). Then along comes Claire Lyons the new girl in 2 year old gap overalls and Keds. The clique just suddenly decides to hate Claire and do all the nasty things they can think of to her, But Claire decides to get revenge on the clique.If you enjoy books about mean catfights and such this is the book for you."
1,Multiple Choice; a horribly useless book,"This is yet another book I was made to read in school, and once again, it is a horrible disgrace of a book. It is meant for girls (definatly NOT for boys) there is a bit nof cursing and the plot is boring and pointless. I was told that it would help me get through middle school, ya right!. This book just increases the dread within everyone to go to middle school. I can't wait. Trust me, this book is nothing but a moral decimator and just makes you feel as if you have nothing, reading about girls who buy a $700 skirt. This is nothing but a person who was obviously oblivious about middle school ramblimg on about some peopole's problems. Wake me when it's over.P.S.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
5,a must read 4 preteens!,im 12 years od amd i think this book is a must read.i loved it. it really seems like a real middle school life and is just like the experiences i have had as a 6 grader and now that im a 7 grader it still seems real.young girls must read this.some parents may not want their kids to read this for the following reasons1.language2attitude3.the way they acthopefully they wont rub off on your kidschloe
2,Slide Viewer,"The slide viewer was smaller than what I expected. In fact, the way it was packaged with other items, I initially thought this viewer was not in the box."
3,Pana-vue 3 slide viewer,I am satisfied with this product. It was inexpensive and allows my to view my father's old slide. With this I can narrow down the ones I want to have made into photos.
3,Poor guy,"This pana-vue slide viewer came on time, it works just ok. It is kinda cheap in quality and did not perform all that well. I would not buy this item again or recomend it to others."
4,Exactly that I needed,"I have a lot photos on paper, then slide viewer works very good for making digitals photos using digital camera."
3,Bit pricey for what it is,"It does what I needed it to do, but I'm sure I could have bought a similar item for $1.25 if I had bothered to look."
5,Best Value,We had 14 trays of slides to view and this little viewer was THE most economical way for us to cull through all the slides. There were other options available to us but they were all more expensive. Believe me. this is what you want.
4,Small slide projector,"This small slide projector did just what I needed it to do. Would have loved to have a larger one, but this small one worked just fine."
1,No better than a CrackerJack prize!,"I've gotten better prizes in a Cracker Jack box! The picture, in comparison to the other viewers next to it, is deceptive....makes it look MUCH bigger than it is! I guess if you have PERFECT eyesight, it might be useful, but not for me! Adorama camera suggested I mail it back (at my expense, of course) and that would have cost me more than I paid for it!! I asked them to simply credit me my purchase price (a measly $2.99) towards a bigger and better viewer that I was willing to buy, but they refused. You've lost a customer.....I will NOT buy from Adorama again. Buyer beware! If you are looking for a way to really SEE your slides, this is NOT for you!!"
3,slide viewer,It doesn't cost much but is very adequate if you are not using it long term or for great details from the slides you are viewing. The problem is the shipping and handling costs more than the viewer!
4,Good for digitalizing slides,"I needed a slide viewer to make digital copies of my favorite slides. Could have bought a special adaptor for my Nikon Coolpix 990 for $50 or so, but decided to give this a try. It works very well; I got excellent results with it.The only drawback is that although it precisely covers my lens, it cannot be fastened onto it like the special adaptor would have, so I have to hold it firm with my left hand while holding the camera with my right, but it can be done. I'm happy with it."
4,Pana-vue # 3 is for me!,"I usually use this for making digital copies of old slides. It is a very inexpensive and simple way to do just that. Check out my ""related image"" to see some results."
4,"Simple, practical","Like the fact that this viewer is so simple, no batteries required. All you need is a good light to view your slides."
4,good saw,"I have had this saw for 2+ year now and this is an ok saw for cutting wood with the standard blade but I strongly recomend buying a carbide blade and tossing the standard one because it cuts 100 times faster and the battary last longer. The bottom line is that this saw is good for short cuts (because it is hard to keep strait on long cuts with out a strait edge) 1/2"" plywood or less, expecialy luan. P.S. I read that this saw was originaly desinged to cut veneers."
3,Just not enough power for a circular saw.!,"I bought this because I had several other VersaPack tools. None of them are powerful, but they are great for light duty. Adding the 7.2V circular saw was a bad idea. The only time I appreciated this tool was cutting some 1/4"" plastic lattice. If you want to cut spruce 1X4's, figure 3 boards to a charge and you'll have to go s-l-o-w; this saw bogs easily. Blade spins too slow to attempt a plunge cut even in 1/4"" softwood paneling (I stubbornly tried until my arm and wrist got sore from the kickbacks). No depth adjustment. Would be good if you crosscut tinkertoys, just not very versatile. I wish I'd spent the extra money for the 3-3/8"" Makita."
2,Why Bother,"This saw has like zero power. The only thing it is good for is cutting branches. I tried to cut some plywood, and got about 2 feet before it died on me. I like most versapak tools, but this one is just useless. Get the Recropracting saw instead."
3,Be realistic,"Some of you OBVIOUSLY didn't read the specs on this thing or you'd have known what you were buying. I bought this with a specific purpose in mind and it serves quite well. I cut branches, and make small cuts that are easy and don't require the power (or the bulk) of a standard circular saw. This thing is great for small stuff and is easier to make straight cuts than with a recip saw in most cases. Know what your buying and you won't be disappointed."
2,Numerical Geometry of Images,"If there's one topic this books is not about, it's the numerical geometry of imagesdespite its title.This book should have been titled ""Introduction to Geometry of Curves on Surfaces.""The closest the author gets to anything resembling the study of the numericalgeometry of images is the Taylor series expansion of derivatives taught in mostundergraduate calculus courses - and two simple MATLAB program of questionablevalue at the end the book.There are a handful of simple algorithms in the chapter 7 but they only addressfast marching methods applied to two silly boundary value problems. The authorcompletely ignores the corresponding initial value problem.I'm giving it 2 stars since the title of the book was completely misleading.And after reading it, I was left wondering how would someone apply the informationpresented in this book to a simple 2 dimensional image since there are absolutelyno examples of any practical value."
4,dash mount,perm glue pad great until it needs to be removed. The temp pad is not worth the time to try it.
3,Bad Adhesive,I followed all the instructions and mounted it with the permanent adhesive after the temporary one melted into a gooey mess (cleaned up easy). Sometimes it holds fast and other times it's useless... I am afraid to try another adhesive just yet so I deal with the adhesive woes. The base its self is great the Garmin locks right into it securely and you can adjust it to any angle you want.
1,garbage,I had to return the item because it didnt even stick to my dash. I ended up using the window mount instead which works great! very dissapointed with this item.
1,Piece of junk!,"Don't waste your money if you live in a warm climate. The temporary only lasted about an hour, and I don't want to put a permanent tape on my dash, and have it there when I trade in the car. And yes, I did clean the dash with alcohol per the instructions."
1,review of garmond dash mount.,"garmond dashboard mount for street pilot c550 [010-10747-02]the product comes with a temporary mount stick pad and a perminent stick pad. the temporary stick pad lasted for less than 24 hours despite riggidly addhering to the install instructions. the instuctions on the perminent stick pad stated that if it came off, one would not be able to completely remove pad residues from the dash board, leaving some perminate residue. therefore, i was afraid to use the perminent padart kirchner"
1,This Thing is TERRIBLE!,Buy the dash mount unit as this suction cup windsheild mount will freeze to your windsheild and you won't be able to get it off after about a week. (no kidding)I just bought the dash friction mount (with heavy nonskid beanbags) and it works great on a contoured dash. Worth ever penny of the $25. Buyer beware on this item... Garmin should re-design the rubber on this suction cup to be able to deal with high and low temperatures without damaging the cup!
5,This is just what I want,"The new design of the dashboard mount gets rid of the wear and tear of the air-tight suction mechanism, which eventually will deteriorate and cause the GPS unit to fall off from the dashboard. With this new design, it's carefree! Just out of curiosity, is there any phone holder that can accommodate this ball-joint swivel mechanism? I am thinking of turning my mobile phone into a car black box video camera recorder (with a simple free app.), which requires a ""carefree"" holder."
3,Garmin Dashboard Mount,"When our Garmin 2720 StreetPilot died we purchased one of their NUVI units. To our surprise the dash mount for both of those lines is the same. The NUVI does require a gooseneck adapter that connects to the unit and slides into the dashmount. If you are making a similar transition, you may be better served by using your old dashmount and save the money needed to buy a new one."
2,Adhesive fails in sun,"The temporary adhesive pads soften in hot weather, which can cause the GPS to fall off your dash. Beside the risk of damage to your expensive GPS, this is potentially dangerous, because the GPS could slide under your brake pedal.Other than the issue with the adhesive (which has been a problem for years), the mount is reasonably well designed and effective."
2,windsheild mount,"While occationally they let loose and allow the unit to fall, i always mounted mine low on the windsheild so the fall was only an inch or so minimizing damage to unit.However , i am having to order a new one because (i am guessing) i left it attached to the windsheild during a trip west and the sun was so hot it ""melted"" to the windsheild.Recentley attempted to move it from one vehicle to another and half the rubber stuck to my windsheild."
1,Did not work,"This was useless and waste of money .It does not work.The Glue is not strong enough, this product does not use sucktion"
2,It Sucks!,"The peice that's supposed to stick the mount to the dashboard had a very, very weak substance. It did not stick at all. I had to buy velcro and use that instead."
3,Works ok,The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the adhesive on the mounting disk is poor. the mount came off of my dash in less than a week. I fixed the problem by using Velcro strips.
5,This is a collected sample of a genius!!!,"Babyface is one of the greastest in RnB. A mastermind in what he does and this CD is just a sample of all the amazing songs that he has wrote. Classics such as ""Everytime i close my eyes"", ""Its no crime"", ""whip appeal"", ""Never keeping secrets"" are just a few of what is on this CD. Before listening to this CD, i did not know much about his music, but after listening to it, i had to buy all of CD's. These are all great songs on the CD, but there are songs that are just as good or even better on all of his other albums. Babyface is a must have for all RnB lovers!!!Quantrell RobertsonJefferson City, Missouri"
4,Mixed Collection!,"This has some good stuff on it, but still missing is the single or radio versions of some of the songs like When Can I See You Again. The single version of I Love You Babe has a much better ending. The version here, however, can be found on 2 previous CD's. There is a 7 minute unplugged version of Change The World with Eric Clapton on guitar. Why isn't his first big hit with his group The Deele on here? Two Occasions is pure Babyface! Someone To Love with Jon B would have been good too! Overall it's a smooth R&B set for those long winter nights to come!"
3,Babyface greatest hits collection,"Babyface has always been a great singer, writer, and producer. I love his music and the artists that he has collaborated with throughout the years."
4,Baby Face Greatest Hits,"Mellow, yet pleasant to listen to. Some songs I was unfamiliar with but nevertheless no regrets in purchasing this CD from Amazon. Would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mellow and relaxing music"
3,"His greatest hits, not his greatest songs","This is the Babyface you hear on the radio, which is a pretty darn good Babyface, but some of my favorite songs, like ""Given A Chance"" and ""This is for the Lover in you"" aren't on here. But it does hav ""when can I see you"" and ""change the world"" which almost makes up for it. Get it if you like Babyface, but for all you Babyface fans, there's nothing new on this CD for you."
4,Mixed Collection!,"This has some good stuff on it, but still missing is the single or radio versions of some of the songs like When Can I See You Again. The single version of I Love You Babe has a much better ending. The version here, however, can be found on 2 previous CD's.

Overall it's a smooth R&B set for those long winter nights to come!"
2,Not impressed,"Not impressed. Assumed it would be great, since I normally love his voice. I actually wish I could return it."
4,Good collection of some of his finer songs,"First I'll start like I do on many ""Hits"" albums by saying, yes there are some good songs that were left off of here, like there are in many ""Greatest Hits"" album, not everyone likes the same exact songs, but on theis one, you do get 14 of some of the better songs he recorded through the years. You get some upbeat songs and some slower love songs on here. Most of the songs are produced by and written by himself, and of course he did a nice job. Of the 14 songs, you get 1 classic, 1 almost classic, 5 ok songs, and the other 7 are good, with most being real good. Guests ar eon 3 songs. A nice album to have from one of the more consistant R&B; singers.#1 - 8 (upbeat song)#2 - 6 (another upbeat one)#3 - 9#4 - 9#5 - 9.5#6 - 10 (CLassic)#7 - 7.5#8 - 9 (f/ LL Cool J, Howard Hewitt, Jody Watley)#9 - 9 (f/ Stevie Wonder)#10 - 7 (f/ Reic Clapton)#11 - 7 (upbeat song)#12 - 9#13 - 6.5#14 - 7Kenneth Edmonds -- b. 4/10/1958 -- Indianapolis, INCheck all my reviews"
2,Not the best design,"I'm a big fan of Lego and Lego Technic. This is an otherwise interesting set that is beset by two problems: the track undercarriage is a bit flimsy and the worm-gear on the arm is too weak to drive both the middle and outer arm segments. With extended play, I expect the 8-tooth gear on the worm to fail. This set has been discontinued so prices vary wildly. You may find Lego's more recent excavator, #8294, to be a better value proposition. The new model is larger and mitigates 8419's shortcomings with new tracks and two linear actuators."
5,Great tool box,I would highly recommend this tool box. This is my second one. Not replacing just wanted a second one. I use mine for a condensed electrical tool box. Works great for small repairs.
4,pretty good,the final two songs make it a worth while buy album if you are a fan of Serial Experiments lain if not well good luck
3,This is US version album,this album is US version albumUS version was two tracks removedtrack number 2 (remix duvet) and 12 (TV version duvet)
5,Great toy,"My 6 y.o. son received this as a birthday gift and he loves it. The coolest part is that it has a little ""weight"" that can be attached to the sea monster's belly to make it float in the bathtub. I have stopped buying tub toys for my two little boys because Playmobil keeps them entertained!"
4,Very tasty but a bit too salty,"These peppers are very tasty but a little too salty; however, the flavor is better than other similar products. I used this twice to make fritattas and also on pizza. My results were very good.When I used these with eggs I didn't add any salt and it tasted great. They're low in calories and fat and the ingredients are simple enough. I'll buy these again."
5,Fabulous!,This pot rack was easy to put together and it looks really nice up on the kitchen wall. Highly recommended!
4,A decent pen and ink set,The blue ink and the ink pen are great! The grey ink has a thin texture and you have to shake the bottle a couple of times in order for it to become less watery. Once you do it shows that subtle silver color. Overall very pretty and easy to use!
4,Good quality at fair price.,"This is a fine, smooth-writing pen. I only wish the set had come with larger ink pots, especially the blue. Now there's an intriguing color. Highly recommended."
1,Is this even a game?,"Boring graphics. Boring sounds. Awful level design. This Tom and Jerry game is just boring and basic. I was hoping it would have the crazy action in the cartoons, hitting Tom with a hammer, trying to blow up Jerry, but all you do is scroll the game to the right, die, wait for Tom to come back, die, then run out of continues. The end."
5,Great screwdrivers,"bought these screwdrivers when I started doing electrical work as an electricians helper.They really hold up well under severe jobsite conditions. I have never had a tip dull or break on me and I Find the rubber grips give me extra torque compared to a standard plastic handled screwdriver.These tools have a very durable finish- I have never had a problem with the shafts rusting like on other cheaper store brand tools.The 7 piece set is a good starter set as it gives you all you really need to get started in the field. The Cabinet tip is great for switch and outlet cover plate screws, as well as being long enough for work in a braker panel. the phllips and standard drivers are good for the screw terminals on switches and outlets.The long slotted driver really fits the bill for removing panel covers as well as occassional light duty prying.I would recomend picking up Kleins nut drivers to go along with these as well as the stubbies and swivel drivers for more rapid screw removal."
3,Sandisk cover,"The products was far over priced. Had I been able to see them I would have only purchased the silicone skin and the travel/home charger. The arm band is made from a non stretch material that fits only around my lower arm. I purchased it specifically for using while I was weight training. The belt clip is very cheesy and I threw it out only minutes after I opened the package. The silicone skin was well worth it, but you could purchase it alone for far less than forty dollars. Overall, I do not recommend this purchase."
1,You can't run these through a laser printer,"The heat generated by a laser printer shrinks the cellophane window causing the whole envelope to crumple. I tried three different printers. To add a return address you need to use a label, stamp or possibly an ink jet printer. To me, that doesn't look professional. Will not buy these again."
2,Quality Park #10 Redi-Seal Left-Window Envelopes are FLIMSY,These Quality Park #10 Redi-Seal Left-Window Envelopes are FLIMSY. I will not be ordering them again regardless of their cost.
2,Not what I was after,"I was hoping for a book of comprehensive tab, this book is only chord charts (most of which are too general to be of use). It would be good for someone only interested in strumming along or for lyrics, but not for the serious guitarist."
5,Great guitar sheet music,"Not surprisingly, this book met, even surpassed, my expectations. Containing the exact sheet music that The Edge uses, the songs are easy to pick in the guitar, instead of losing time deciphering the notation. Even though some songs do not have been included in this collection, since the guitar part is minimal, this is because it includes the music from the album ""Best of 1990-2000"", and that's the album's fault.All in all, a fantastic piece of music for the U2 fan."
3,Nowhere near as a good as Americana!,The best album the Offspring has produced to date is still Americana. Conspiracy Of One is not a bad album but comes nowhere close to topping Americana. It is worth buying though.
5,These guys can't make a bad album.,"I have all 6 Offspring cds, and they are all great. This one is no different, all 12 songs rule, especially the fast ones. ""One fine Day"" is my favorite."
3,What happened to the offspring?,"This is album isn't terrible like Americana but it is probably just a little better. Unfortunaley for the offspring they have to make a complete album instead of just 3 or 4 songs that they can release as singles. I hate to compare them to their contemporaries like Green day, rancid , nofx and other mid 90's super bands but it seems like you have to because all these bands have kept making good albums while offspring have gotten away with putting out singles and horrible singles at that. The worst song on this album is ""original prankster"" which sounds a lot like ""pretty fly for a white guy"" which is probably one of the worst songs in history. They have some good songs on here and i know they are/were talented and can put together a good album it's just a matter of focus or purpose. Best tracks: ""i want you bad"", ""one fine day"", ""million miles away""."
5,great bands produce great albums,"Offspring's previous cd, americana, was a favorite cd of mine for a very long time. after i heard a new offspring cd was out i immediately thought about how good americana was. i bought the cd. i was nervous because i only knew one song, and feared dissapointment, but something told me this would be great. and i was right! if you're a big fan, or just a new listener, this is a great cd for you and i recommend giving it a listen! enjoy!"
4,Brilliant,"I think this is one of the offsprings greatest albums. I listen to it everyday and i cant get it out of my head 24/7. My fav songs are 'dammit, I changed again' 'special delivery' and 'want you bad', I really reccomend you buy this album. YOU'LL LOVE IT!!"
3,"Offspring, Conspiracy of One","The Offspring's new CD is mearly average. There are a handful of good songs like Million Miles Away, Vultures, and Original Prankster. Their honky voices get on my nerves after a while."
3,Ok......,"There are some good songs on this CD, Come out Swinging, I want you bad, and Million Miles away are all great songs. I have to say though, after hearing Original Prankster i was very dissapointed, The Offspring have beomcome to commercialized for their own good. This band used to Kick ass on the Punk Scene and now they just packed up and left all together. This is still a good CD, dont get me wrong, but if you want a great Offsring Album buy ""Smash"" or ""Ignition"", especially if you like punk."
4,Additional Features,"I live outside of the US so I got this CD at regular price. The additional features (the fact that it's an enhanced CD, with videos, a karaoke option, and entrance to the official Offspring fan club) mentioned by a previous reviewer are, as far as I've heard, the same as the features of the regular CD. The only difference between the import and the regular one is the song ""Huck It"" which is a very good song, it all depends on whether you're willing to pay extra for just one additional song. I wouldn't."
4,Punk voices mixed with hard rock... it sounds good,"The Offspring have always been a punk band. They still are a punk band. On Conspiracy of One, they throw a few more had rock elements into their music, and keep most things the same. They manage to stay the same while changing, resulting in a loyal fan base and more people coming into their circle."
3,not their best cd,"this cd is ok, but is more main-streamed and has less hardcore punk edge to it. dexter's voice has gotten alot better and prettier, unlike smash. it's noticeable. i think it is one of their lamest cd's, although some songs are pretty good. i rank the top 3 this way;1. want you bad--good, punk rock song2. one fine day--funny song about drunken fights3. special delivery--ok, hard-rockingi suggest that if you like americana, buy this, you get your money's worth."
3,good for the first week,this CD is not much different than any of the previous ones. the first couple songs are very good for about a week and then get old because they sound so alike. the rest of the songs on the CD just arn't that good. It's not as much the music that gets old as it is his voice gets anoying. I would recomend an earlier offspring album.
3,"not as good as americana, but still pretty good","The songs, or at least some, are more serious than Americana's line-up. The music is more heavy, well usually but not in the case of songs like ""Original Parankster"" and ""One Fine Day."" Overall this is pretty good rock/punk."
5,This CD is F-U-C-K-I-N Great,"This Cd is great.. it's one of Best from OFfspring,+ it has like videos from old songs so it's good. every one should buy this Cd.. all the songs are on this cd is great.. especially the second one.. forgot the name..."
5,Fantastic! You won't be disapointed!,"I was told that Conspiracy of One wasn't as good as the other Offspring albums, but I bought it anyway because I decided they'd earned my money from making such great stuff in the past. And they've kept it up! Conspiracy of One is the bullet paced, funny, smart, and angry album that earns Offspring their fans! The CD Rom extra is great, and the album achieves the ultimate cool and just plain rocks! This is going to be in my player for months!"
2,Pathetic.,"This is not real emo. It's not punk either. Hardcore? Nope. Crap? Indeed. See, the only redeeming factor about this album is the song ""Want You Bad"" which sounds like new New Found Glory. If it sounded like old NFG or Knapsack, I'd hate it. But the rest of the CD is just really really bad. It's not real emo like KoRn and Sunny Day Real Estate. Besides, Redman guest stars on the album, and rap is really bad. Well, except Limp Bizkit, but only on the new album cause I love when Fred Durst does that squeaky thingy with his voice. But that's another review for another time. In the meantime, get the only good Offspring album, Milo Goes to College. Word to your mother, says Nick Hexum of 311."
2,....not that good really,....I know that these guys started pretty good at the early 90's and that they along with rancid and NOFX made Epitaph went up....but now in their latest musical effort they just recorded another set of boring songs like most of the ones in Americana...they just made a one hit wonder....a hit between all american pop fans....they just made a...boring album.....they are truly sold out....and that's not about the record label....some time ago Bad Religion and Green Day change Epitaph and Lookout for Major labels too...but they kept their sound and their convictions to the end....not like these posers.....
2,Straying from the Formula,"I don't understand what the big commotion is with Offspring's new album. I am very disappointed with their newest offering. The band is not the same Offspring we have all enjoyed in the glory days of Smash, Ixnay, or even the half-decent Americana. If you're a die-hard Offspring fan, you might be thrilled at their new offering, but if prefer Offspring's earlier works over Americana, don't pick up Conspiracy of One."
3,Die Hard? No.,Many of us have come to know The Offspring by their edgy lyrics and great riffs but nowadays things have changed. The Offspring have adopted a new sound more MXPX meets Green Day sorta thing. Basically theirs next to no swearing and the lyrics don't really make much sense and don't envoke the anger they once did. This is a good CD to pick up I guarantee Smash or Ignition will still reign as the best Offspring CD.
1,...,"I used to like The Offspring, I liked all the stuff they did before Ixnay on the Hombre. But their newfound sound, mixing latino rythms into their punk-sound just didn't do it for me. I am all for artistic growth and evolution...but damn' I really wish they would have stuck with what they did best, playing catchy punk-rock music. One can only hope they will return to their old sound, although it is doubtful."
1,very weak...,"I'm gonna keep this simple. I own about 400 discs and have listened to all types of music, good and bad. This disc is weak and is a sorry excuse for an offspring effort. It has about one fourth the attitude Americana and Smash had. How can any true Offspring fan even compare this to those two releases. There is about 2 really good songs and the rest are blaaaaah. Americana and Smash came out of the gate aggressive and in your face and never let up the whole time. There was passion in their aggressive punk rock attitude. This disc never gets you pumped up or gives you that old Offspring ""I wanna smash something"" feeling. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,ThEY'vE doNe WaY BEttER!,"The offspring have done way better. ""Smash"" considered their best album (also of my opinion), ""Ignition"" , Their self-titled, ""Americana"", and ""Ixnay on the Hombre"" are all way better than this one. Once they left Epitaph and signed with sony i think they pretty much went downhill from their. I still enjoy some of their new stuff but my heart is with their older stuff with their true punk sound. Offspring is still my favorite band but i just don't listen to this album anymore. when their first album came out i don't even think i was born yet, I'm only 13."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"CONSPIRACY OF ONE got some good songs like Million Miles away, I changed again and the title track...But i don't think it's a inspired moment from OFFSPRING...Even Splinter is better than this...If you wanna love OFFSPRING stick to their albuns until IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE from 1997 or maybe AMRICANA from 1998...All the rest got good songs but also some filler songs!"
4,Ok,"This album isn't as good as smash or ixany but is probably better than ignition.I'd say its about on a par with Americana it still rocks though.Dammit I changed again,CO1 I want you bad and one fine dayare the best tracks on the cd to my reckoning.One fine day rocked live at the M.E.N but anyways its a good album if you like the album buy it.If your a sad pop poser who thinks the offspring are the hardest punk gets, still buy it.If your a... actually ifyour anyone buy it, its worth the money."
5,Must have...,"I really didn't like the past albums...but this one is a MUST HAVE. I love all the songs! But my favorites are Original Prankster, Want you bad, Million miles away, and One Fine Day. These songs I rate a 10/10. The rest are 9/10, while the song Conspiracy of One I give it a 7/10. The songs are very catchy, and will stick in your head for a while, and you will find yourself singing along. It's one of my favorite albums to date. So don't delay, if you don't have it, buy it. It's worth the money."
4,Don't Judge By First Hit Single,"When I bought Americana, you have no idea how dissappointed I was. I don't think there is one song that I like on that CD. I thought that Affspring had gone off the deep end, and I thought that Conspiracy Of One would suck to. Then I heard Original Prankster and I knew that CD would suck. I gave heard it a friends house and I was blown away. Original Prankster is the only song on the CD that I don't like. I think that they made a bad choice in having that song be their hit single. This CD also passes Americana way up. Americana sucked.This CD is awesome."
5,Great Follow-up,Jim has written another well crafted modern fantasy story that follows the only advertising wizard in Chicago. His characters are well fleshed out and filled with all the human frailties that make a character interesting. His plots are wickedly twisted and his imagination is well rounded.This second novel of the Dresdan Files series is highly recommended.
5,Best Book of the Series,"I really enjoyed this book, well I really enjoyed every book of the Dresden Files, but this book is by far my favorite! My favorite quote comes from this novel. ^.^"
4,Summer Knight,"Fun!!! Exciting ride with hummor and characters you can't wait to meet over and over. The tongue in cheek references are too cool. Harry Dresden is one of my favorite characters. I am surprised that someone has't put a tongue binding spell on him, but he would probably explode."
4,dresden files,"I first saw a segment of the Dresden Files on TV. Had never known about it before, so I thought I would try a book. Enjoyed the book, so I have now read the whole series of books and am waiting for the next ones. I personally don't know how much magic there is, but the principles of the book are good. Light, dark, good , bad and all the temptations out there that send people to the dark side of life."
5,Definition of a page turner,"If you like fantasy, sci fi, mystery, or all of the above, you will get sucked into the Dresden books. Summer Knight is one of the best."
5,Butcher's Best,This is my all time favorite Dresden Files book. The story is unique and fun. Sure it has a lot of the same old elements in it like the beetle and getting into too much trouble. It just has a different level of dimension to it as well. It was a fun easy read. It will continue to be my favorite Dresden File for many years to come.This series is one I recommend repeatedly to friends who love Harry Potter. Think adult Harry Potter with a slightly less well knit community.
4,"Faerie, Vampires and Wizards; Oh My!","Harry Dresden, a wizard private investigator is in trouble yet again. Harry is worn out in this book and the white council is meeting to judge him about the war with the Red Court vampires. Harry's faerie debt to his godmother is traded to a fellow faerie. He agrees that the debt will be wiped clean after 3 favors. The first favor is that he must find who actually framed the Winter Faerie Queen.How Harry manages to survive in these books I do not know, but each and every one of them are intriguing and I cannot get my fill of them. Harry shows his human side in this book, he has to make some decisions on if he should help his problems or help everyone. I have read books 1-4 so far, and this was by far my favorite. I cannot wait to read the next!"
4,Enjoyable read,"I'm not much of a fantasy fan, but when a friend gave me this book to read I gave it a try. I found I quite liked the private eye combined with wizard aspect and the prose was face-paced and engaging. Enjoyed the Fairy pizza humor and ended up being pleasantly surprised."
3,What's up with Coke written 14 times?,"I enjoyed reading this book as well as the earlier books in the Dresden series. Butcher has interesting characters and situations in his novels, making his novels fun to read.In this book, I noticed Coke written several times on a couple pages so I started counting. From page 247 to the end Coke(coca cola) is written 14 times, too commercial for my taste."
3,incomplete description,"I was dissapointed with the condition of the book. There were a few things about the book's condition that were left out of the description, such as multiple breaks to then spine anda tear to the outside of the spine. The book is still in readable condition however I would have appreciated a more though description of the product."
3,Not my favorite but...,This book sets in motion events that will change the magical as well as Harry's life for everthis is not my favorite of the series but it is a necessary link in the chainesp when you get to the 2 most recent booksas always butcher as a nack for writing what feels like a pulp detective story from the 1940's but set in the modern world (more or less.
4,Best Dresden yet!,"Really engaging story. No terribly irritating characters. Even Murphy managed not to behave like an idiot. I look forward to seeing more of the political side of things.I took away a star because thus ebook is horrifically overpriced and, even for the extra money, they still couldn't manage to put spaces between words!"
3,The weakest so far,"Dresden gets caught up with faeries, after an encounter with his faerie godmother, concerning his debt from the last book. The faeries quickly take over the story, which is all about their power and politics. Familiar characters are mostly absent or not further developed, as a consequence. I found the faeries to be less interesting than many characters from the previous books. There's still a little humor, and some action, but the charm and wit of the previous books is hard to find. This one reminded me more of a typical fantasy novel, of which there are many. Fantasy with a blend of other attributes, like Butcher so effectively developed in the earlier books, is missing. So as standard fantasy, it was okay. In terms of what I had expected, it was disappointing."
5,"Clever magic and guts to the rescue, again!","Harry is in worse trouble then usual. His girlfriend is now a vampire. The vampires have put out a contract on him. The white council is deadlocked trying to decide whether to let the vampires kill him or do it themelves. It's raining frogs and someone just sold the mortgage on his soul. What could be worse? Well, if he doesn't crack an unsolvable crime in the next couple of days then it's the end of civilization (and life) as we know it.As usual Harry is out classed, out gunned, out muscled and out magiced. If straight forward magic won't see him through then maybe imaginative magic, unexpected resources, dirty fighting and being just too plain stubborn to realize he's beaten might save the world.The best in the series so far!"
5,Dresden Files,"The ""Files"" are so much fun. Adult oriented, a pinch of sex, life's hardships magnified, keep you up all night, just when it can't get worse, this guy could be real (if he could be), great sci-fantasy, I'd buy the writer a beer kind of reading. A great mix of modern day and fantasy. A super series! Summer Knights is the best of the series so far, talk about on the edge of your seat..."
5,Butcher does it again!,Jim Butcher does it again with another great book. This book was a page turner from the first page to the last.
4,fun reading,Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series are well done and enjoyable reading. Make sure you read them in order though. Harry Dresden continues to develop as the series continues.
4,Summer Knight book 4 Dresden Files,This book is slow in places and doesn't keep my attention. It seems more technical then the firt 3. I will read more however.
5,summer knight EXCELLENT!!!,I love this book. The Dresden Files are riveting reading. I recommend Summer Knight to all Dresden fans old and new. I am rereading it on Kindle. I own it in hardcover as well.
2,"Just a few too many Fairies, Fae, Silde, Werewolves and Wizards to keep up with","Butcher continues this series in typical frenetic style, throwing Dresden amongst the Winter and Summer faery Courts, apparently tasked with the job of finding the Summer Knight (I think)Unfortunately with a few too many sub, mini, side, and overarching plots it all becomes a little too much. I couldn't even tell you who the big bad guy was.Still this is Butcher's style, so if you like it you do, if you don't two stars..."
5,Fantastic,Wow. They just keep getting better. This 4th book of The Dresden Files is for and away the best one yet. IF you even remotely liked the first 3 then buy this book.
3,I hope they get better again,"I've really enjoyed the prior books in this series, but this one was pretty flat for me. Harry is even more of a mess than usual, and the faerie politics were just a little too complicated. There are a few decent spots of action, and the climactic final faerie battle is written well enough that I could picture it in my mind, but overall I was left wanting more. It may be that there just wasn't enough of Harry's supporting cast here... Murphy only plays a small part, and Bob, one of my favorite characters, is only in one scene. I do plan on finishing this series, so I hope they pick back up!"
4,Knight's Alright! (4.5 Stars),"After a disappointing third outing, I was reluctant to pick up Butcher's 4th installment, but after letting it gather dust for 8 months I finally bit the bullet and started reading. I kept on reading, and found it hard to put Summer Knight down. Harry Dresden's character was spot-on, back to the hard-boiled gumshoe I knew from the first two books in the series. The plot is sprawling, but the pacing is taut. There's lots of humor, magic, and plot twists and far less phiolosophizing.Bring on the next book!"
5,Amazing,"(...)I just wanted to say i listen to this CD everyday. I really admire Carrie because she is not some fake-voiced, beauty and makeup obsessed star. I think she should be way more famous than she is though. I recomend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to great songs sung by great voices."
2,SORRY NOT FOR ME,"Given his age at the time, Michael's voice is mature beyond his years. Alas this is not matched by Carrie. Carrie sounds like someone has their hands around her throat restricting her. She is also singing partly through her nose - nasal sounds. The theme and choice of songs are very good, and the orchestra are superb. Worth getting for the rendition of ""Ben"" but otherwise go for the subsequent solo albums.I don't like to be -ve but like Simon Cowell, I have to be honest"
5,Fantastic for 2 or even a large group,"My wife and I love this game. It is about the only game we play any more because it is quick, easy and enjoyable. More importantly it expands to play with up to seven players. So if we have company we can play it as well. So far we have introduced several other people to the game who have gone and out bought it right away. Definitely recommend it to any game lovers."
5,BOHNANZA - - A REAL BONANZA OF FUN,"It takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game, but once learned, it is a lot of fun. A good game for four players, and a great game for six players. It generates lots of lively action, with the bidding for the cards.We played this game on a cruise with four strangers. They were no longer strangers, after the game. Everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it. That's how we got it. Bought the game after playing with family."
3,Good but not great,"This is a relatively simple card game that can be played with a range of players. It is nice since you can have an odd number of players without disrupting game play. There aren't a lot of good 5 player games out there. The rules are somewhat convoluted, but once you play a round it makes perfect sense. The game isn't terribly complicated so it is fun to play when you want to talk and not focus totally on the game. It is a good ""party"" game, but not something I would go out of my way to play. Being a card based game it is rather portable which is also a nice feature. I think it would be difficult for children under the age of 7 or 8 to comprehend the rules."
4,If only planing real beans was this fun,"When explaining the premise of this game, it comes across as the most boring game you could possibly play, planting beans! Yipee! But once you actually start playing, it turns out to be quite an entertaining game with lots of intense bartering and yelling at each other in our case."
4,Fun and Fast Strategy Game,"I was glad to find a strategy game that was enjoyable to play with my wife, mostly because a game lasts 20 minutes or so with 2 player. Longer strategy games such as Agricola/Puerto Rico/Power Grid definitely have their place for a more in depth experience, but this game found the gap in my game library of quick and fun."
5,who knew?,"This game is so much fun. You end up doing a lot of math and figuring, as well as strategy! It's crazy how much fun such a simple game is! I really enjoy this game and I am 25... I don't know how well young children would like it, but for my friends and I, it's perfect."
5,A game you must play -- beans you must plant.,"How can anyone not like this game? How can anyone not be interested in learning the German name for soybeans? How does anyone not want to get to know the deeper bean trading skills of your friends?This game is fun, easy to explain, easy to learn. When I teach it to people, we usually do not need a trial round. It's intuitive, there's a bean planter in all of us. I have a Taiwaneese, South African, Indian, Hongkong, and Australian friend who all asked me to get this game from Germany. Shame Amazon doesn't have it at the moment!!!"
2,Inappropriate details on bean cards,"First, let me say I love this game and it came in perfect condition. With that said, when I played it with a group of adults I never actually paid attention to what the beans were doing on the cards. After buying this game for a friend with younger children, I noticed that some of the beans are smoking, drinking, have guns, and are throwing up. Even though it indicates the game is for 10 years and older, I know my friend doesn't drink/smoke, etc. and wonder how appropriate the cards are for children that DO notice details like that. The whole reason for buying this particular game is so that my friends could play it with their older children (8 year and up). If it weren't for the inappropriate graphics on the card, it would be 5 stars."
5,Very Addictive!,"A very fun game to play with 2 players, or more!! Not like any other card game you have seen before!. A must have for any gamer! You wont regret it!"
5,a blast,"This game is easy to learn and addictive. The pictures on the cards are sturdy. It gets one star for durable because, hey, they're cards, and your two-year-old will find a way to destroy them, but they really are well-made. If you like games like Apples to Apples or Settlers of Catan, I recommend this game. (It's not really like those games... I just think you'd like this one, too.)"
4,A Fun Quick Game for Everyone,"The game does not require much strategy but it is very addictive. Its a fast game that you can play with up to seven people! its quick to learn and easy to set up. Its not very good with two players, you can have fun with three but four or more is when it gets really fun. Highly recommend for people who want a quick fun game."
4,Easy game to learn and play,"We play a lot of games and we like this one. I have eleven children, some married and some still at home, plus grandchildren. We have a fun time playing this game and many of us can play at once. That is always a positive."
5,Be careful who you teach this game to as some people are prone to addiction!,"Bohnanza is a great game and fun to play. I have introduced it to numerous people and all of them enjoy it. One of the few downsides, and this will depend a lot on who you play with, is when people try to guilt trip others into doing them certain favors. I like to keep things straight and objective and find this aspect of play can be rather repulsive."
5,addictive fun for the whole family,"Who would have thought planting beans could be so much fun?! Our kids (ages 9 & 12) LOVE this game -- in fact the whole family gets into it: the creative trading, the wheeling and dealing, the planning, the anticipation... all make for lots of laughs and excitement. The game is fairly easy to pick up and moves pretty quickly. Good clean fun."
4,A fun card game using strategy and planning,"This game is different than any other game I have and I had to read the instructions several times before I felt qualified to play it. As the players also caught on, we found it was competitive and a lot of fun, requiring strategy and planning. The illustrations on the cards were also fun."
5,So fun!,"This is one of the best games to play, especially in a group of 5-6 people. Even though it takes a game or two to catch on, the strategy that it requires keeps it really interesting and fun."
5,Our family loves this game!,"This is a fun, family oriented card game. My 6 year old learned how to play, and has beaten her 17 year old sister! There is strategy, risk, and just plain luck. A fun game, easy to learn and great for a group."
4,A cute family card game,"This game is a nice addition to our family arsenal of games, with a logic sufficiently different from other games that it was of interest to all players. One just shouldn't take beans too seriously, so this game is best played in a suitably wacky mood - the card graphics help with a laugh or two. I suspect that the game could be played in cut-throat mode, but we found that all benefited when all cooperated - a message one just doesn't find very often these days."
3,"Yes, I'm an Idiot","Not exactly what I was looking for, but there was certainly much I didn't already know. Great resource referrals! I wanted more specific, step by step instructions, but now I know where to get it from reading this. I did not waste my time or money."
3,Collector Car,Simple (good) read but it is not going to be a how to guide or give you a ton more information the reading Hemmings publications.
4,Steppenwolf Live (1971),"Some have said that this is a ""fake"" live album and I guess if by that you mean not live in a concert hall then you are correct. It is a live in the studio re-recording with different arrangements (ala a live concert) but with the crowd noise pre-recorded and mixed in. You should not blame John Kay for this as record companies of the era had a lot of power over their artists and this type of ""faux-live"" release was not entirely uncommon at that time. It is still a fantastic record and a great collection of songs and I give it a definite thumbs up, but you just have to get past the fact that this was not recorded live in a concert arena. But it is representative of what Steppenwolf would have sounded like in a concert of that era, with one exception, ""Hey Lawdy Mama"" is a full out studio recording (think of it as a Bonus Track) and while it fades into ""Magic Carpet Ride"" in a rather clumsy way, it's not a deal breaker."
4,Steppenwolf - 'Live' (MCA) 4 1/2 stars,"Believe this CD has been released on several labels through the free world.My copy mentions inside the info fold-out that this album is from 1970 and it is IN FACT a fake-live lp at that.I thought to myself,""Don't tell me they're pulling the 13th Floor Elevators scam..."" I've listened to this CD several times and it doesn't sound fake to me.But then again,I've heard some horror stories of how vocalist John Kay does have some enemies out there.Either way,'Live' is a good pick.Tracks that had me playing this disc numerous times were ""Sookie Sookie"",""Monster"",""Hey Lawdy Mama"",""Magic Carpet Ride"",the memorable ""Pusher"" and the FM radio staple ""Born To Be Wild""(I've heard doo-wop stations play this song in the afternoon).Very old school biker rock&roll.Line-up:John Kay-vocals,Larry Byron-guitar,Nick St.Nicholas-bass,Goldy McJohn-keyboards and Jerry Edmonton(R.I.P.)-drums.A must-have."
2,"Haven't read it all, but I was not impressed.","I was thoroughly disappointed when looking at the very first map I found that the book listed two Costa Ricas in Central America, the first one overriding the presence of Guatemala (and it didn't even point out Belize!). Then I found the spelling of llama listed both correctly and incorrectly (one l) and I knew I wasn't going to be able to proceed..."
3,Nothing To Crow About Too Much,"First of all, I am baffled by the many people who is hyping Pharrell as the ""next soul"" singer of his generation. Anybody who says this, DO NOT know soul music (I am grateful my parents introduce me REAL soul). Pharrell has a decent voice and its different, but its nothing to crow about. Pharrell copied alot of his vocal style from Marvin Gaye. But if you want to hear the real thing...get Marvin. And as for the music? Typical Neptunes. What I mean by that is the beats are bangin', but the lyrics are wack and weak. Get this cd for a party, but that's about it."
1,"The Neptunes are ""frontin'""","I don't like the Neptunes, because they are ruining hip hop. Snoop Dogg is known for his gangsta image, and it's being ruined thanks to Pharell's poor production skills. The Neptunes are making beats that sound like pop music. If I wanted pop music, I'd listen to Britney Spears or Clay Aiken. Pharell will never amount to what Dre and Timbaland are. Pharell and his Neptune buddies need to stop making beats. They SUCK!!"
3,depends,This cd is ok but if u like rap it is kinda different its more funk music . there are a couple of hott tracks butt most of em are ok. there are 9 songs i like out of 19 but there are about 7 hott tracks
5,The Best EVER,"Neptunes once again prove that there is no match - Nas track is by far the best - can't type anymore, gotta listen again-"
5,NEVER DISAPPOINTED,"I've followed these guys ever since ""Rump Shaker"" was a hit! This album features so many hot artists and the beats are NEVER a let down with their originality and catchiness.There is something on this album for everyone - alternative, hip hop, r & b, rock & roll...My favorite is Busta Rhyme's track (""Light that Ass on Fire"") - the beat on this song is SICK and will be thumping in my car for quite some time."
4,The beats straight bump,"Hugo and Pharrell lay it down hard on Clones. There are some sub-par tracks, but overall the variety of commercial mc's do it right. The ninth track with snoop, is hella crunk. The 3rd verse opens with the line, ""it's the diabolical, chronical, mythological, psychological, make a model hoe f**k a g"" i didn't know snoop was capable of such witty wordplay. there are other gems on the album but i haven't heard snoop come with such force since he dropped doggystyle back in the day. anyway, overall its a sick album and the instrumental version is a must for any self-respecting dj."
3,Clones? How IRONIC!,"Granted if you want to get the party going, play something by the Neptunes. Their funky beats are a great breath of fresh air from over-produced artists of yesteryear (IE: Dr Dre and P Diddy). The only dissapointment is if you listen an album entirely produced by them, you'll see a lot of repititions. I heard some songs from ""Clones"" and they all sounded like other songs I've heard before. Some reminded me of ""Beautiful"" by Snoop Dogg, and others reminded me of ""Girlfriend"" and ""Like I Love u."" I only reccomend this CD if you want background music for a party. Otherwise only get albums with only 2 or 3 Neptunes songs, NOT THE WHOLE CD!"
2,"I Hate to naysay...but,","The Clones has some hot tracks by some not ""well known artists"" and Frontin. The others I was dissapointed, Busta Rhymes just...oh goodness, terrible. I felt some twinge of dissapointment on NERD also, I come from old-school hip hop, real hip hop and The Neptunes can make some slammin beats but can make some wack tracks here and there. Overall this is an album to try before you buy, seriously. A lot of artists are against downloading music, but earn the money! Make better records, this is one that pretty much fits the download category."
1,Luckily i listened to songs before i decided to buy this,a couple days before the cd came out i was able to listen to the whole thing on aol instant messanger. the beats on this cd are okay even thought they should be amazing because its the neptunes. the lyrics on this cd are pretty horrible because the artists are all horrible except snoop dogg. the clipse are on it a lot and suprisingly there lyrics weren't bad i guess they stepped it up a lil bit. anyway theres no really good song but some okay ones so don't buy it.
5,Phat CD,This album is the sh*t. The beats are off the hook. If you had a choice of one cd this year The Clones is the choice.
3,Expected more,"I was expecting something special here, and this album didnt deliver. People often compare the neptunes to the likes of dr dre but this offering didnt even come close. the neptunes are renound for killer beats such as nellys hot in herre, snoops beautiful, britneys im a slave for u, common senses come close, only 3 tracks came close, if feat nelly, frontin feat jay z and don of the dons feat jadakiss. if you wanna here a killer album with the tighest emcees try hi-teknology by dj hi-tek, beats for your ears, rhymes for your mind."
5,The Neptunes make it,"This album is amazing. The style is hip-hop and a lil' rock. Everysong is a winner the lyrics are brilliant. You could listen to this for days on end and wouldnt get bored (i found out myself:) ) If you like most hip-hop, rap and r 'n' b music you'll love this, also if you like rock to you'll love it. Drum's, guitar's, great rapping and singing and of course the wonderful voice of Pharrell. What more could you want???"
2,Disapointing Compilation For Neptunes Fans,"I just got this album today expecting some of the best production from the Neptunes and feel cheated. There is nothing groundbreaking on this album. Basically 7/10 of this album is filler with some particularly sub par production from the 'tunes. The lead singles ""Frontin'"" featuring Jay-Z and ""Light Your Ass On Fire"" by Busta Rhymes are the best songs on the album. Some tracks such as ""Blaze of Glory"" and ""F**k n' Spend"" are just plain awful. Overall the reason why I gave this CD only 2 stars is because it is a huge disappointment. Preview a few MP3s from this CD before you buy it!!!"
5,GREAT BUY,"This is a really good neptunes cd, feat luda and all the home boyz from the hood, i recommend this its the best cd i boughten in a while, number 15 and 4 are the best but all the songs are really great"
2,Average,"the Neptunes have a true sense of Catchy Grooves&Hooks here&there but after a while it thins out&then you have been down this road before.""frontin"" Cracked me up with Pharell Singing.I dug the Skeleton element of the Song.the Hook was cool.Musically they have some Moments but these Guests don't add nothing really.I think the Biggest Problem I have with the Neptunes is that they are Hot Shot Producers who are all about Sound&Less on Lyrics to Me.as long as the Beats&Grooves are cool they are safe but if they have to survive doing Words&Music then they will have to Clone off Someone to still maintain what they have build up thus far."
3,"It's ""OK""","But for producers of this caliber, is that good enough? I actually liked their N.E.R.D. outing much better. A few songs caught my ear: It ""Wasn't Us"", ""Hot"", ""If"", ""Rock n' Roll"" (nice beat, tissue-thin lyrics), ""The Don of Dons"", ""Hot Damn"" (my co-favorite, long before the album release), and the biggest treat on the whole album (and other co-favorite): the return of Dirt McGirt, AKA Ol' Dirty Bastard with a beat that fits him like a glove on ""Pop Sh*t"". That song is wearing out the drive mechanism in my car's CD player. The rest of the album simply sounds too much like filler, despite the contributions of some of the hottest names in music today. I realize every album has it's fair share of ""filler quality"" material, but this album is akin to an all-star game in sports. A-list artists backed by the hottest production duo on the scene today. There should be no filler, let alone this much. However the songs I do enjoy justify my purchase. (Dirty's joint is worth it alone)"
4,Busta at his uncensored,I got a Rap song in all of it's explicit glory. I could not get such a copy anywhere else. Yea Busta Rhymes.
3,I bought it for one song.,"When I bought Clones, it was for that lovely song Frontin'. Who else other than Pharrell could make the crude line ""and I was gon' tear your a-s-s up"" sound romantic? This album is hit and miss at best. I would say I only listen to 6 or 7 songs. But if maybe 5 songs from the album had been cut, it would be at least a 4 star affair. Frontin, Hot, Hot Damn, Good Girl, Popular Thug, and Loser are the only GREAT songs. The rest range from average to bad. I understand the rock songs F***N Spend and Half-Steering are on here to show an eclecticism, but they break the flow of the album: plus, they're not good."
2,okay but not great,"The neptunes have had many great collaborations before they released this album, most being creative but then the productions just started to sound the same. Unfortunatly the productions on this album sound quite the same. The guest appearances on the other hand are mostly good with a great appearance by busta rhymes and for once clipse sound good on this cd. You should buy this cd if you are a hardcore fan of the neptunes otherwise I would advise you to save you money"
2,Let Down,"I know what you're thinking - hot damn a whole neptunes album - its gonna be banger after banger. Imagine an album with a track like ""Hot in Herre"" followed by a track like ""southern hospitality"" followed by ""Beautiful"" followed by ""Grindin'"". True Nelly, Snoop, Jay-Z and all the other rappers that the Neptunes have made amazing tracks for are on this album, but none of these songs even comes close to matching their more famous collaborations. Basically, it's an album of afterthoughts and half baked ideas that the Neptunes would normally have left on the cutting room floor. Oh I should also warn you: there are three gawdawfull rock tracks in the middle of the CD."
3,"It's the Neptunes, however it could be better","Ok I listened to the whole album, its not as good as NERD, their sophmoric album turns out to be about average. The good songs include Snoop, Nelly, and Vanessa (new artist) I hope to see more of her in the future). I think Neptunes need to drop all these phonies like Roscoa P Coldchain, and keep people like Kelis this girl has brought a lot to the plate with the Milkshake song. Check out her new album if you like the neptunes. Peace 3 stars, AVG."

1,An unsatisfying experience,"After hearing ""Frontin'"" on the radio, I was very excited to purchase the Neptunes ""Clones"" album. Here's the verdict: they are GUILTY! Guilty for leaving me EXTREMELY disappointed. I can't wait to get my $20 back (if I can)! The only really good song on the album is ""Frontin'"". The rest are loaded with obscenities (particularly the ""Light Yo A**! on Fire"" song--was all that cursing and sex imagery necessary?!), tepid lyrics, and nerve-wracking beats. I was expecting much more; they failed to deliver. Nonetheless, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams are extremly talented artists, and songs like ""Beautiful"", ""Change Clothes"" and ""Excuse Me, Miss"" made a fan out of me. I will afford them this one misstep, and am confident that on future efforts, they will live up to the name they have made for themselves. I truly hope they tap into the talent that was NOT displayed on this album!"
4,neptunes=pops savior,That is very true B.N (Before Neptunes) most didnt listen to pop because of it new kids on the block like qualities. Thanks to Pharrell and Chad for opening the eyes of Justin Timberlake to show him all he had to do was to get a little soul in his Nsync hole
5,Soviet Lavish Production of Full Length SLEEPING BEAUTY,This SLEEPING BEAUTY comes in the form of two cassettes - Part l and Part 2 in order to include almost everything that appeared in the original production of 1890. The performance of Irina Kolpakova partnered by Sergei Berezhnoi is ideal. The audience response is overwhelming. This is a rare performance to be cherished.
5,A Great Sampler,"This is probably one of the best single CD compilations of American Soul. Although these songs are available on other collections, this CD is all meat and no filler. A great mix of party classics, novelty, ballads and blues from some of 20th century America's seminal artists. Five stars!"
4,fascinating look at a true shaman,"I am very pleased to see the life and work of Don Agustin Rivas in print. This man has and continues to lead a remarkable life. Having worked with Don Agustin as a teacher for several years and heard many of the stories, it is good to see that the book remains true to them and captures the heart of Don Agustin's adventures. The book focuses on Don Agustin's personal challenges and accomplishments, but also contains many teachings and wisdom from one who has sacrificed much to be of service to the people and to the Earth. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to know more about ayahuasca shamanism and/or the life of Don Agustin Rivas."
1,Screw Kindle,Can't believe anyone would pay $85 for a DRM laden Kindle book. Used copies in hard book are reliable.
4,not what I expected - and that's a good thing,"I thought this movie would be so corny that I would have to turn it off after a few minutes, but to my surprise I really liked it! It's genuinely funny and fairly unpredictable. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's actually not just for kids, adults will enjoy this one as well."
3,Tooth Fairy,"Everyone said Schwarzenegger was miscast forKindergarten Copand yet it is one of the more popular films he made. His comic relief in movies like it andTwinsandTrue Liesshowed he had far more talent than he exhibited in movies likeCommando [Blu-ray]. I think Dwayne Johnson is showing he is more than an action hero as well. I certainly like his toughness in movies likeThe Scorpion King [Blu-ray] andThe Rundown [Blu-ray]. I have enjoyed everything I have seen him in so far, and although I love his action movies, I am entertained by his comedies as well. Another good one for the family here as he plays a mean hockey player that has to learn to respect peoples dreams including his own. He shows he can be tough but with a softer side as well. His ego takes a bruising and he learns the meaning of team player. Good quality DVD with a standard content. If you enjoyed this catchThe Game Plan (Full Screen Edition)andRace to Witch Mountain (Single-Disc Edition).CA Luster"
1,Almost unwatchable,"There hasn't been a Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson movie that's failed to deliver yet (as far as I'm concerned), but Tooth Fairy is the first disaster on his resume. He'll bounce back just fine, I'm sure, but this movie is as close to unwatchable as any movie I've seen.I'm shocked at the majority of favorable reviews on here. I'm not sure if I was watching the same movie! Or maybe they watched the movie with their 5 year old kids, and the kids laughed and had a good time. But for an adult without children, this movie was a complete disaster."
4,fairy good fun,"this was a good movie.Dwayne johnson was funny,and able to stand up to big names like julie andrews and billy crystal,the only thing i wasn't happy about was the extras,their was no bloopers on the dvd,surely there must have been blown lines,right???i say buy this movie you won't be disappointed."
5,Hilarious movie starring the Rock,"The Rock has some good movies out. His comedies are pretty funny but I think this one takes the cake. Great story line special effects. It will definately have you laughing almost the entire time throughout the movie. You have to see it to believe it. Pun intended. Great movie for the whole family, go pick this one up today, you won't regret it!"
3,Not a bad little family movie.,Cookie cutter plot about tooth fairies and childhood faith in such. Even Julie Andrews seems to be phoning it in. But The Rock goes all out and so does his beanstalk British case worker/mentor/wish-he-was-one. Has some cute moments and The Rock's smile lights up the screen like I haven't seen since Maurice Chevalier (albeit without the continental slyness). For the junior set it's a fun little family movie...for the adults it can't quite make you forget that missing tooth despite Billy Crystal showing up in an energetic mini-supporting role and again in the end credits. I just had the feeling when it was all over that something was missing besides the tooth!!! But the kids loved it and The Rock in a tutu is their new hero...and I guess when all is said and done...that's what it's all about. (for the tweeners there's an interesting turn by Ryan Sheckler (skateboarder) as the hotshot up and coming hockey player)
2,I watched it....it was painfull,I really believe that Dwayne Johnson was miscasted for this movie. Dwayne's moviesare action movies and he never smiles as much as in this movie..and it really feels fake. Or is the problem is having seen Dwayne Johnson in all kinds of action films where he is the leader and is always cool and under control. But in this movie he plays a regular guy....who smiles a lot ...Could be good for kids or others that dont know the Rock. Nice to see Julie Andrews is still getting acting roles.
4,Okay Movie,I enjoyed Game Plan more than this movie. It was a little strange with his supervisor that dreams of becoming a tooth fairy. The story line needed a little work but overall a pretty cute movie.
3,Tooth Fairy dvd,"The Rock is good in this, but not as funny as he got later in movies. It is funny and worth getting if you like The Rock."
4,cute movie,This is a cute movie for little families. It shares a good message and is entertaining for all to watch.
4,Cute movie,Purchased this as a gift for someone. Great family movie. Kids of all ages should enjoy this. You'll get some laughs out of it.
2,???,"Got this for the grand kids, but I thought it was a silly movie. The kids didn't like it much either."
3,It's ok,My daughter is beginning to loose her baby teeth and I thought this would be a good and funny way to ease her into the transition. It was ok for me but she had fun watching and had a lot of questions afterwards.
2,tolerable til the end,"Though plagued with bad acting (but it's okay, since it's a kid movie right?), certain parts of this movie have merits. However, toward the end, logic goes completely out the window with the scene where he talks to the fairy godmother and what she does to him. That scene completely make the movie up to that moment pointless."
2,"movie was OK, but kind of slow","This wasn't a terrible movie, but it is kind of slow and the jokes are a bit lame. But who cares what I think since it is a kid flick. Well, my 7 year old thought it was OK, but not fantastic, just OK. My 11 year old didn't like it at all and thought it was dull. So it might be an OK movie for younger kids, but the older ones, not so much."
4,good movie,Good movie for family entertainment. Kids and parents alike will enjoy the Rock as the unwilling Toothfairy and the situations he finds himself in.
4,Tooth Fairy movie,I bought this movie for my children and they like it a lot. It doesn't stack up to a lot of their other comedy movies but all in all it delivers some humor. Just not enough that they want to watch it over and over again like many of their other movies.
4,fun movie for kids,"My grandkids loved this movie. A little potty talk, but overall very fun and lighthearted.This was a gift for Christmas for 5, 8, & 10 year olds."
4,Surprise!,I bought this DVD because I saw Julie Andrews was in it. It was wonderful when I watched it with my grand kids. But to my surprise there was Ashley Judd and Billy Crystal also. Triple treat!
4,Family fun,Enjoyable movie that shows how small acts of kindness towards others can change us for the better.A spin on priorities. Its drives home how the lesson that a family is the only source of true happiness and what really matters in this life.
5,POsitive thoughts,Good inspirational movie. Good for any ages.Any time we need to rmemeber that only good and positive make you happy and healthy. Watch this movie take all goods from it and apply in your life. It's fun.
5,DVD,"My order was originally lost in the mail. However, when I contacted the seller they were very quick to send me another DVD. I certainly recommend this seller and will be buying from them again."
1,tooth fairy,got it at a store for 19.99. and didnt have to pay a shipping charge. so i saved some money. if you charge like stores do why buy on line.
1,Nothing received yet,"The whole shipment not received since Sep.01/10, thanks to check or return our money immediately."
1,Even my kids wouldn't sit through it.,"This movie was really, really bad. My kids got bored. Bad script, bad acting, bad effects. Just plain bad. Don't waste your time or money. I want my money back!"
2,5-Piece Dining Set,"The table is nice. The chair spindles are not made properly. The finished parts of the spindles are not long enough and the unfinished wood shows. I tried a replacement set of spindles, but they looked worse than the first set."
2,Not a good game,"Billy and Jimmy Lee are back -- unfortunately, so are ten of their biggest enemies in this fifth installment of the famous Double Dragon series. Some things have changed, however, and players will face off in one-on-one battles instead of the side-scrolling action found in previous Double Dragon games. Four to six special moves are available for all 12 playable characters, and a plethora of secret codes and options are waiting to be discovered. Also, character attributes are customizable, allowing players to configure a fighter to match their personal fighting style. No matter whom you fight with, the Shadowlord will be ready for a final confrontation."
1,Berkeley graduate student,"Hello, although this book is probably a classic book in fluid mechanics, I would have to say it is a bit advance. I am currently a first year graduate student at Berkeley and I find that this book is not a very good reference to my fluid dynamics class. To any mechanical engineering professor out there, choose a book that is a bit more elementary!!!"
5,Awesome cult classic video game,"This game holds so many great memories with me.I remember playing this game when I was about 11 years old with my best friend at the time.There was just something really special about running around and shooting Zombies with a squirt gun lol There are also other cool weapons you can use against other ghoulish creatures.Such as Vampires,Killer Dolls,Huge Spiders,Jason look-a-likes and sooo many more.This game is a thrill to play,but its even better when you play it with a friend.So check it out.I highly recommend it.Also...you might wanna pick up a six button controller if you don't already have one.It makes this game alot easier to play."
4,Freshly Squeezed Living Room,"I hate housework. Vacuuming. Mopping. Shining up the commode. I especially dislike dusting, so usually put it off until I can draw little pictures on the coffee table with my finger. So when it's time to polish up the furniture I might as well enjoy the added bonus of a fresh citrus scent, which is why I dust with PLEDGE ORANGE SPRAY.Just spray, wipe, shine. I've been a fan of Pledge dusting products for many years, as I like the way they shine up wood furniture. Coffee tables, end tables, dressers, bookshelves, cabinets, window sills--anywhere there's wood I'm dusting away. The wood is cleaned and moisturized--and smells like fresh oranges.Sometimes it even makes me hungry.So when it's time to dust, use a product that not only cleans good, but smells good, too. PLEDGE ORANGE SPRAY. Your living room will smell like a citrus grove and shine like a new penny, all at the same time.--D. Mikels, Esq."
2,Not loving orange clean multisurface,"I used to use just plain Pledge for wood surfaces but I have not seen that on shelves for a while. All I've seen is the newer ""multisurface"" types that claim no waxy build up. I was skeptical but decided to try the new type. Well, I'm not thrilled... It works fine on most surfaces but not on the surface I care about the most... stainless. Pledge used to be my ""go to"" product for shining my stainless kitchen. It used to leave it perfectly streak free and shiny. Not anymore. This multisurface stuff leaves streaks all over my stainless. It also leaves streaks on my granite countertops. This is not an improvement over the old formula."
5,Great Tool for Pulling Nails and Details,"I have the blue handled version of this tool. Same thing just made for cutting harder wire. It is very well made and hasn't rusted yet although it is best to spritz these tools with WD40 (the only real use for the stuff other than taking grease off of car paint) to be safe. I have used these mostly for pulling nails that are hard to get at. I don't use them for electrical as I find they are not near as handy and unlike the previous reviewer I cannot easily cut 12 gauge romex with them - it is simply too hard on the hands to use them for this purpose. 10 gauge Romex would be out of the question. I also don't believe that they are intended for cutting Romex and unless you want to stain and hurt your hands I wouldn't use them. To cut Romex, the proper tool is the Klein linesman's pliers. That tool cuts the Romex without much effort."
3,Not the Same as the Super NES,"While the main portion of the game is 95 percent the same asThe Original Super NES Version, There are a few flaws.A. The music and sound effects are slightly differentB. The Graphics are slightly differentC. There are 2 new mini games.Now, some people may not consider the mini games a flaw but I don't believe in updating the classics with new material. Now, An album re-released many years later with material recorded back in the day that was cut, different story.Plus, when it comes to the main portion of the game, it's no different that theGame Boy Color Release, which I really didn't care for either. If this game was a straight transfer ofThe Original Super NES Version, I would probably like it better."
5,A little challenging than the SNES,I loved donkey kong country when it came out on SNES and now it's on GBA which is a little more difficult with the bosses and some levels. Im glad they didn't change the music in the levels they were awesome when you play DKC. vulture culture/ice age/oil drum alley were the levels with the music I liked.
4,FUN FOR TWO PLAYERS!,MY BROTHER AND I LIKE THIS GAME! I GOT TO PLAY DIDDY AND MYBROTHER GOT TO PLAY DONKEY KONG.IF I WOULD RATE THIS I'LL GIVEIT FUN AND OUTRAGEOUS.
4,"Good game, okay remake","When Donkey Kong Country came out nearly 10 years ago, it was unique with its new computer generated graphics and ""collect everything"" gameplay. Now, nearly ten years later DKC debuts on the GBA. It is basically the same game. But now, on the GBA, the graphics and crispness look faded and are not as impressive. The gameplay is reminiscent of Mario World but not nearly as good. Despite there being varied levels, the gameplay is more memorization and timing than anything else. One small mistake could end everything. Things like this make you want to chuck your game boy at the closest wall. The game is challenging, but not in a good way. The add-ons like Funky's Fishing are pretty yawn inducing but some are nice. And the cameras are rather tedious to collect. Nintendo could've done more to this game, like added new levels or something. The hardware on the GBA was not used to its fullest on this game. DKC could've been great, but as it is, it's just average."
3,Not that Great!!,"I rented this game from Blockbuster for a week and didn't play it after the second day. One of the best pars of the game is when you dance, but that's the best part. When you play the actual game, you die way to easily. i have beaten all the Zelda games within a week each, but i could not get past the first level, mainly because you don't see enemies until you hit them and die."
2,Donkey Kong Country?,"Not exactly. I was a die-hard fan of Donkey Kong Country when it came out for the SNES, and I had hoped that this game would be a re-release of the same game for new fans to enjoy.It's not.This is why, more or less, the grade is so low. I loved that old SNES game to death. I think I may have loved it a little TOO much, however, because I waited several days before actually entering my name to play it. Why? Because although I turned the game on the very first day, the absence of that wonderful image of Cranky with the phonograph made me realize I wasn't back in Kansas, so to speak.Yes, you may get some kicks out of this game if you're a new gamer. Yes, you may find it amusing if you were a casual fan of the original, but for an orthadox Kong-aholic like me, I just don't reccomend it."
3,This game is not really difficult,"I found this game, ok... i guess. it wasnt really all that great. I mean, sure, at first it's fun but then I simply began to play for the pleasure of finding out what the next level was about. I was also playing the Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 and I played more often because it was more fun and then I beat the game. Once I beat the game I began to play Donkey Kong and it was SO easy. I beat it in a few days of 1 hour per day. If you want a game that is really difficult and will last quite a while, dont pick this game. It was extremely boring."
4,Fun While It Lasted,"I really wasn't planning on ever playing Donkey Kong Country, but it came with the GameBoy SP that I bought so I thought I'd give it a try. The game is ok and there are some difficult levels, but on the whole it was pretty easy as it only took me 2 days to beat. Bonuses within the stages are extremely easy, and it won't take you more than 10 mins to get yourself 99 lives so you won't ever game-over. The mini games are fun though, you can either fish or play DDR; I think those kept me more entertained than the actual game. Even if you're a moderate gamer this game can't last more than a week, not worth the money in my opinion."
2,a cumbersome translation,"Master Ni does not trust the reader to be able to understand the Tao without his using many words to explain it to us. As a result, his translations are long and cumbersome compared to the original text, and completely devoid of its beauty. If you want everything spelled out to you step-by-step, then this is the translation for you. But remember that the 'Tao Te Ching' starts off by warning the reader 'The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao.' It is up to each person to find an understanding of the Tao in his/her heart. By trying so hard to 'speak' the Tao with his words, Master Ni ignores the spirit of the true Tao."
2,interpretation rather than translation,"Whether you will enjoy this version of Lao Tzu's work depends a great deal on whether you are looking for a translation or an interpretation of that work. It may also depend on your reaction to the author's assertions regarding the influence of the Hua Hu Ching text.As a translation, I can't recommend it. Like other ""interpretations"" of the same writer, it is difficult to figure out where Lao Tzu ends and Ni begins. There are clearer, more direct translators - David Hinton comes to mind - that do a better job of stepping aside and letting the original text have its say.As for the controversy regarding the Hua Hu Ching text, the author presents one version of its history; other sources present quite different versions. I found the text to be quite different in content and form - especially the later chapters - from what I understand to be Lao Tzu and am skeptical about the assertion that this it informed the formation of Mahayana Buddhism."
2,Meh,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas a few years ago. I thought they'd have fun with it because they love arts & crafts. It was fun for them, but they blew through the pages quickly and the stencil didn't hold up long. The ""lite"" part of it didn't work well and the black on the pages made a big mess."
4,ENJOY THE PIC'S!!!!,"ENJOY ALL THE VINTAGE PIC'S BUT, WOULD HAVE LIKED IT BETTER IF THEY WOULD HAVE INCLUDED HISTORY FOR THEM."
3,excellent playing but poor choice of programme,The bands skill level is as good as ever but I was disappointed in the poor choice of programme. Would have liked some more well known pieces. Apart from Floral dance a bit flat.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!,"I made the mistake of ordering a box of #4 Kraft bubble mailers from this vender, and received some cheap knock-offs that are not self-sealing. The description of the product is false advertising!"
1,Not durable,"These mailers are not good for mailing books which is what I purchased them for. Even just taking the mailer from the house to the post office, and they are already torn. Who knows what condition they are in once they arrive at their destination. I tried to contact the seller about these ""tough"" mailers but they haven't responded. Definitely not worth it."
4,"Great price, great product","I use these to send out items I sell through Amazon and eBay, and they are very good for that purpose. They're inexpensive, but they work just as well as any name brand item would."
4,"Cool game, fun at times, can become repetitive.","Cool game, fun at times, can become repetitive. I play this game once a week and at first get so engaged, but it may become repetitive. I used to love these Gradius games and I bought it to return me to my childhood times. Its fun for people who love it and I highly recommend if you have the time for this game."
4,A Nostalgic Trip to the past,"You know, this game is awesome in ALMOST every respect. It emulates the Gradius games perfectly, from the very first all the way to Gaiden. It keeps the good ol' music intact, the controls are easy to pick up on, and the it's nostalgia is pure. The one problem is that these games are a wee bit difficult. As in, original japanese difficulty. The good news is that they've implemented save states, so you can restart at a tough level. Overall, It gets 4 stars from me."
1,Mucking up perfectly good songs!,The orchestra that plays these songs is REALLY bad!!! No sense of rhythm or any idea how to make a song come alive.yuk.These people shouldn't be allowed to play this music.
3,Top Zipper could use re-design,"The Sherpa Pet bag is study and well padded, but the top zipper issue is ill designed... it is very difficult to zip the top panel as it travels to the narrow curve near the front of the bag. You must pull up as you zip and be very careful not to gather material into the zipper. I can see the possibility of the zipper sticking and may break if force is applied... but this was the best bag for airline travel in it's size."
5,"good seeds, germinated well","Great seeds, they had a very high germination rate (which is impressive for rosemary). The plants have a very nice and strong rosemary scent."
1,Gun Not Included.,"I received the game only, and on the receipt that came with it, it said no light gun included. The other reviews, the product features, and the pictures led me to believe the gun would come with it, but that was not the case. And the normal controller doesn't work with it. I tried the NES Zapper on my trio system (that plays NES SNES and Genesis and has controller ports for all three) and it didn't work."
3,Doesn't have buffer on all sides,Its good. But has a blank side. Does not mention this in the listing. Use for buffing before applying gel nail polish.
3,Innacurate summary,"I haven't read the book but I probably won't due to the incorrect review. Yes the Me 262 was the first operational jet fighter, the United States could not respond to the 262 with the X-1 because :1.The X-1 was never an operational, mass produced, combat aircraft. 2. The X-1 was rocket powered. The whole book is about Jet Combat, not Rocket Experiments. Maybe exchanging X-1 for XP-59 Airacomet would be more accurate. But still the XP-59 would not be exactly accurate. The P-80 (later changed to F-80) was the first OPERATIONAL jet fighter. [...]"
4,Good entry level book for the casual reader,"I used this book in researching my Air War College paper on Vietnam. It was useful in its description of tactics and the deployment of aircraft. The book's focus is primarily on the application of (jet) air power. It does not dwell on the overarching strategic decisions or the overall campaigns/conflicts. A reader would be well served by having a historical familarity with the conflicts before reading this book - but it isn't essential. It is an enjoyable read with good information and photos. (But, I agree with the earlier reviewer - the name for the book carries some strongly negative connotations - at least in the States.) Try it."
2,Childrens book,"I was disappointed. This is a book for very young children, it contains few words, and simple ones at that.Halala means 'congratulations' according to my zulu dictionary...which is wrong?"
4,Fun,"The book is a fun guide to the finger. There's a bunch of different types, but the book is lacking. The illustrations are excellent and add to the humor of the book."
5,The humor leaps off the page.,"One would imagine that the mere written words that make up The Office scripts would lack the dark humor and timing of the show. Fortunately that ain't the case as the scripts are just as funny and draw attention to elements that may go missed on the show. And from a writing point of view, it's interesting to see how well characters and situations are developed with the sole use of dialogue and minimal action description.The scripts are printed on glossy paper with 2 or 3 high-res photos per page and are book-ended by funny e-mails and notices from David Brent himself. A definite must have for fans of The Office."
5,Breathtaking Collection of Poems,"Naomi Ruth Lowinsky has done it again, and beyond. Her STORIES FROM THE MOTHERLINE moved me deeply, and then her poems in RED CLAY TALKING. Now I'm immersed in the new breathtaking collection from a treasured poet and colleague, a ""sister-in-dreaming."" In CRIMES OF THE DREAMER, Lowinsky's poems are infused with the animal body - and at the same time spiritual heritage of sensations, feelings, emotions, multi-sensory imagination, spontaneous physical action. Similar to psychotherapy and analysis as it is meant to be, the encounter is joyful, insightful, deeply moving -- at once limitless and well held. Don't miss it! She brings us the food and water of life."
5,We loved it!,"We love Megan Follows in Anne of Green Gables. She was quite good in this as well. My daughter and I very much enjoy watching this movie. It is engaging, clean, fun and teaches good moral lessons. We highly recommend it."
3,Looses novelty after time,"Death duel is an interesting game for the Sega genesis. I looks really neat on the box but the game isn't as dark as it looks. It's a game where you are on a planet as a robot and you have to kill other creatures. You can also shop at a store to get more weapons to battle with. It's not really a great game but its so bad it's good. You can tell how bad it is with its bad controls and bad fight scenes but it's cool because it is bad. Sadly though, it looses novelty after time. It's fun for a while but not a game you will pick up all the time to play."
3,"Decent, bright self contained light-bad handlebar mount","I ride on unlit trails and subi-urban streets-this light is not quite as bright as I would like for the narrow, unlit bike trail, but is ok for streets when there is some street lighting or even bright moonlight.I don't like the mount-it rattles at speed and wavers back and forth--I've had several other cateyes and the mounts were stable and didn't rattle. On the EL300, it has a right to left adjustment--but this stays loose even when the adjustment is fully tightened--the light wanders from left to right on it's own.Sadly, cateye also switched the slide-on direction, so you can't use this light with other, more stable cateye mounts:-(.On the bright side, the light is tough, resists water- I've used it in several pouring N. Cal. rainstorms and it sat outside for a few months when I forgot where I put it--and lit up as well as ever when I found it again:-)."
4,Young rascals,A great sampling of teh Young Rascals. Has some very good songs but some not so great to fill out the disc.
5,stop here,"If you're looking for the best Rascals collection, you can stop right here. I excitedly bought the 2 disc collection when it came out years ago, and was disappointed with the sound and the fact that most of the first disc was mono. I knew this collection existed, but was leary as it was released at he dawn of the CD age (way back in '86). I finally took a chance and it's fantastic! All the tracks are stereo, all the essential Rascals tracks are here, and it sounds better than the 1992 remaster! Go figure.If you're looking for the perfect 20 song distillation of essential Rascals, you've found it. Ah, go ahead. Remind yourself why these guys had so many hits between 1966 and 1968. They were awesome!"
3,Pick and Choose,These guys nail it and blow it consistently throughout the CD. The best of the Rascals reiterate the best of the era.
2,Ping Pong Stereo Effects,"Unfortunately, the engineers decided to add some gimicky stereo effects to the remastering -- moving a drum roll from left speaker to right, putting Felix Cavaliere on the left for one phrase, then on the right for the next, back to the left, etc. This is all unnecessarily distracting."
1,Not remastered,"I'll be selling this one on ebay. It is not remastered and sounds really bad. There are a lot of songs that I would not consider ""Ultimate""."
3,A self promotion magazine,"I discovered this magazine features items from their own store mostly. There is only 1 issue during the year that is worth the subscription. This is the issue where it presents next year's trends and forecasts. The magazine is OK, but I felt it was very repetitive in its loud colors room set ups. I did not renew my subscription."
2,Only one reason to buy this...,"Collectors will want this CD for only one reason: it contains the single version of Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way."" Everything else is commonly found on other CDs with better sound."
2,not a good quality brush,"have to say, the brush is of poor quality. It arrived without a cap, and with a broken hair. This is unacceptable for a good brush. Also, it does not give a smooth writing, and loses hair always. So, I do not recommend this brush to calligrapher. Price is not lovely either."
3,MY Lord's Desire,This book was ok the female lead started to get on my nerves after awhile the male lead was good but i couldn't get going the storyline was interesting but it was a hard read for me I think I might be on readers burnout so if you are looking for a good story and romance give this book a chance
3,my lord's desire,"the book is okay nothing special.the heroine really disappointed me i found her very arrongant and uppity i kept hoping he would find someone else and leave her .i had problems with the hero too i guess i like the strong silent type,he tried to explain everything he did to everybody.i have read other books by this author some i liked some i didn't,this one i would put in the middle not her worse but not her best"
5,The Archer King,"Heartfelt thanks to authoress, Reyna Lorele. Although I Am not an authority on 12th century history, I was transported to a place of mystical proportions. A place where I felt empowered. A place where I wanted to remain just a little bit longer than pg. 454. Ms. Lorele has a way of weaving Wiccan philosiphy into a classic tale. A truly new way (but strictly not new age) bent on traditional themes. The kind of story that makes the reader review for themselves just what real riches are. A page turner for the human spirit."
2,the archer king,"Touted as ""Robin Hood from the pagan perspective"", I find this book to be nothing to crow about. The ""pagan perspective"" is limited to dancing skyclad in one or two scenes, dreams about the horned god, and Robin using magic, not skill, to win any situation. The plot line is basically the same tales told by Howard Pyle and others plus a thought or two from ""Prince of Thieves"", with not much new material added. The characters are flat, with little to bind them together or give them energy. Maerin's religious introspective is stultifying after a while, and there is no spark between her and Robin. If you want paganism in this tale, stick to watching the series ""Robin Hood"" with Michael Praed as Robin. If you want better characterization in the written tale, check out Jennifer Roberson's ""Lady of the Forest"". Her storytelling is choppy, but her spin on the tale is interesting and her characters are better defined."
3,"Finally, a book on Armani","I have ben searching for a book on Armani for years and as soon as I saw this book... I snapped it up. It is not as comprehensive as I had hoped, as it has only 79 pages. The written section appears to be a collection of comments from interviews over the years and the second section includes photos of a sample of his fashions from 1982 to 2000. Anyone in love with Armani fashion will be keen to buy this book. I would love to see a larger volume with more of the same, including more information on Armani's philosphy of fashion design and his everyday work methods."
3,A Great Personal Closeup of the Vietnam War,"Mr. Rowell has written an interesting account of his tour in Vietnam, featuring his relationship with The Eskimo, plus revealing glimpses of his childhood featuring his relationship with his grandmother. The story explores the belief that these two people were ""the angels"" who kept him alive during this coming-of-age period. This belief is bolstered by a psychic event experienced by his mother. Interesting reading."
4,A story of faith and courage,"Mr. Rowell has given us a story of faith and courage. In Granny and the Eskimo, he shares his personal story of growing up in Louisiana and then going off to war in Vietnam on the brink of adulthood. Rowell makes the jungles of Vietnam come alive, and not just in it's stray bullets or land mines, but in the everyday feelings of being in a strange place. In one quirky moment, the enemy is not people, but fire ants that he and his friend have distrubed. Instead of discovering the dark side of life, he discovers his faith through two ""angles""--his grandmother and the Eskimo, a mentor and friend in the Army."
3,"Work well, but only for short stops at the dock","These work well and serve the purpose that I intended them to. My boat doesn't seem to have cleats placed in the most convenient areas and the location(s) where I want cleats would require a pop-up style which is quite expensive and requires cutting the fiberglass. I thought I would try these, and they seem to work ok. The suction cups stick where I need them to, but I wouldn't trust them for any extended period of time. When docked in rough waters, the fender can get pinched or ""rolled"" between the boat and dock, which is enough to force the suction cups to let loose.Overall, these work for what I usually use them for and would be good for someone who docks infrequently or only for short time periods. I would not recommend these to someone who slips their boat or plans on leaving their boat docked for extended periods of time."
2,didn't stick,This suction cups did not hold onto the boat. We had to just tie the straps to whatever we could find on the boat. Would not recommend this product.
1,Poor Suction Cups - Lost overboard,"The suction cups on this product are really bad and I've stopped using the product. Fortunately, they were secured to floating fenders, so I could retrieve them. After the first few times, it dawned on me that I made a mistake buying them. Save your money and mount a permanent attachment point on your boat."
3,Do not stick very well.,"Tried it on rough surface, smooth surface, waxed and non-waxed, wet and dry.They do stick and stay in place if no force is added. As soon as something is attached, they will either slide on the surface or come off."
2,Doesn't hold,"I bought these hoping to avoid tying knots every time i needed to get the fenders out. They served that purpose but I found they didn't hold well enough. I left them on my boat overnight and came back the next morning missing the two bumpers that these were hooked to. I don't recommend them for docking, but they seemed to work OK for tying up to other boats."
2,Suction cups lose staying power over time,"The suction cups lose their staying power over time (or maybe it was just not great to begin with). In their second year, they have fallen off several times even when mounted for less than 15 minutes on a flat horizontal (and clean) surface (with just Kwik Tek Contour Fenders attached). And this was with the boat at idle or docked. I can't rely on them, and will be using a carabiner or snap hook on my cleats."
2,Just to balance the other reviews...,"X-Men is a fun game... on ameatur difficulty level. When I cranked it up to Hero (since you can't get any farther than the third level on ameatur), I found it almost impossible to do anything. I got tired of playing the levels all over again, fighting the same, almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me. Although the game may have captured the feel of the X-Men, I didn't think they did a good job with the actual game aspect, which is probably the most important thing. If you want to play a good Marvel game, try Marvel Super-heroes: war of the Gems. It is much more balanced and fun than Sega's attempt at making an X-men game."
2,This book is a fraud,This book pretends to offer real life stories that different people have sent in about their extra-marital affairs. It does not take an educated reader very long to realize that this book is a complete fraud. The stories that populate the pages of this book appear to have all been penned by a single author--most likely a man. Key mindsets and language are virtually identical from chapter to chapter.
5,Insights into sex lives,It was a fantastic quick read that my partner and I were able to share and talk about. It is great to read actual interviews about other people to realise how different we all are and what things turn us on.
1,Not compatible,The above rating is inaccurate since I am unable to play this game. Didn't realize it was only for Windows 95 and 98.
1,not what i expected.,"it did not provide me with clear information.i did not show me how to make the windows i was hoping to build and i feel it was written for an actual tradesman or someone with a lot more window building experience.if i had that knowledge and skills, i would not have been looking for such a book in the first place.not happy with the purchase."
2,Not worth it!,"collection one was much better, this is really not up to par, I really don't like the songs on it, look into my eyes remix is o.k, but the can't give it up rock mix... big time, buy coll 1, they are classic joints on that c.d, this one just has o.k songs which we are already tried of."
5,i like it,hi my name is mari and i like this webside becase i love music very much and thankyou for have this web thankyou
3,average album...not surprising as vol.1,i was not pleased with this release..the batch of songs on this cd was bad...unlike the vol.1 this cd has too many remixes that just ruined the whole collection volumes...the unreleased songs on this cd is not that great either..most of it are only mediocre songs..hope they will carefully choose what to release in the next set collection.
4,why put remixes on the cd,"this would have been a five star cd if they would have put the normal versons instead of the remixes, the best track on the album is thug luv off the art of war, this is one of the best rap beats ever and the lyrics are deadly, I also luv hook it up, people hate this song cus no limit members master p an silk are on it, people say no limit is bad, that aint the case cus this track is short but very good, frontline warrior is a great track to and slep walkers with eazy e, I still aint feeelin ghetto cowboy though, I think the beat is wack, but apart from that and the remixes this is a very good album but if u have a choice get east 1999 eternal or the collection vol 1"
3,Aight,"This CD is aight, tracks are tight but too much remixes and songs from older albums. One thing that made me sick was on ""Don't Hate On Me"" was to hear Krayzie talk about flossin which Bone Thugs in not about. Hooking up with Master P was a pathetic effort too. Bangin tracks include ""C Land IA"" ""Frontline warrior"" and the new one ""Sleepwalkers"" The remix of ""Look into my Eyes"" is off tha hook and there's always the classics ""Thug Luv"" and ""Ghetto Cowboy"" This CD isn't a must have for true Bone Thugs fans, but maybe is a possibility for people who don't know whats up."
3,ok representation of this troubled group,"BTNH has had the potential to be one of the classic rap groups around, but too often their lineup is mixed with legal issues...songs are ok here and represent whom they are."
4,Great Chair,"I am very pleased with this purchase. It is exactly what i pictured. the other reviews lead you to beleive that the chair is way huge. It is not that huge, although it is large. This chair is very comfy, my two children and i sit in it to watch tv or read stories."
5,Gigantimous,"As mentioned previously, this beanbag chair is GIGANTIC. Got it for the boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES it. Thing is, it is about the size of a small loveseat, so it will be interesting finding somewhere to stash it while it's not in use. But it's exactly what he was looking for so he could play his video games in comfort. Very nice outer material, and the beans inside are really comfy. Much better than those cheapo things you get from Wal-Mart for $30."
5,Awesome Bean Bag,"This thing is fantastic. Easily the best bean bag chair I've ever owned. For those worried about the negative reviews, it's really not hard to figure out. They ship it vacuum packed and without a zipper handle. This is important because it's going to be squished and should never be opened. Mine arrived at roughly 1/5 the size it ends up after several days. I mashed up the bigger chunks of stuck together filling by simply rolling them under my hands through the bag when I first got it out of the box. (Do NOT open it, there is no reason to, at all, seriously.) Also at the beginning I kicked mine around until my legs got tired a couple of times a day to help it along on fluffing up. After just a couple days I could no longer easily get it through doorways. The filling is in there, honest. It's just the air in the filling that needs to find its way back in."
5,A great chair,A large comfortable chair took it about five days to fully expand. the only trouble you might have is storing it if you do not have much space.
4,Fuf Large Foam Bean Bag Chair/Black twill,"Came in a small box with plastic straps holding it together. Opened the box to find a black, cloth cube. No directions but had read previous reviews. Had the kids pull and kick the cube until it loosened up. Took about 10 minutes and we left it for the night. Came down the next morning and it had really filled out. I can honestly say that my 4 kids love it- so much so, we ordered another black one. No smell..but..it does pick up lint and animal hair. We now keep them in the basement tv room- where the dog is not allowed- so not a problem. I would recommend to a friend."
2,bad deal,"This is the worst bean bag I experience, I remember my 70's bag was made of small round pellets that contour your body to perfection, well this is nothing like that, is made of a clumpy material that does not contour your body at all, you have to beat it to your shape, the worst is that after you open the vacuum pack bag is impossible to return it expand to bigger that you can afford for post.Don't buy this bag, seat on one before you put you money, amazon make it sound great but it's not, see I'm 62 and my generation make the bean bag, I know better.alberto caputo"
1,Breathing Problems,"These bags seem really cool on the site, but they are way too large. Also, has anyone else had an issue with their child developing breathing problems after getting one? We had to get rid of ours as our child started having asthma attacks. The dr says she's probably sensitive to the powerful chemicals used in the manufacturing process. It is basically plastic, filled with styrofoam, wrapped in plastic. The plastic smell is very strong, like benzene or something! I had no idea how nasty these things are."
1,Disappointing,"Very large but I sank right to the bottom. Felt lumpy and insufficient - no support at all. Heavy and very smelly. Returned, even though i could not get it back into the box. Just compressed ad much as i could and taped the bag. UPS accepted the return no problem."
1,Its not a bean Bag!!!!,"As title says, this is not a bean Bag. Its a cloth which contains a lot of foam.Zero comfort and not worth of being at home. You sit on it and all the foam would go aside, letting you be on the ground.Spend a bit more and get yourself an actual bean bag and not this piece of foam bag.Lost my buck, dont lose yours."
2,not very informative,"Not a very informative book about the actual science of supplementing to avoid nutrient deficiency - more a blanket statement that it's a good idea. It's written mainly in short-section bullet-point style. It is unrelenting in letting you know that Dr Rath is a great medical revolutionary. I was surprised to come across a section on the benefits of Vitamin C for diabetes, so I googled the topic and immediately came across a study where vitamin C had a negative effect for diabetics - at odds with the glowing recommendation of vitamin C for diabetics in the book."
2,"Vitamin C, so yesterday...","This is stil another book about healthy living through vitamins. Except this one promotes massive vitamin C doses, come on this is so yesterday..."
2,Animals and heart attacks,So silly. Elephants are totally different than humans. The author is not comparing apples to apples here. Let's get real..
3,Good but not Great,"Na Leo is best at their original and hawaiian songs. ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" and ""You've Got a Friend/Lean on Me"" are not as good as songs like ""Hawai'i Nei"" or ""Hapai Hula"" or ""Saving Forever"". This is still an enjoyable album, but I don't like it as well as ""I Miss You My Hawaii""."
2,"Death metal, but thats it.","I don't think Deeds of Flesh will ever come near the brilliance of Trading Pieces or even Gradually Melted. I have all of their albums except Inbreeding, but this one is the last one I bought, looked for to most, and was consequently most disappointed by. Hit the double bass switch for the whole album and turn on the tremelo guitar fuzz, and then just let it go, baby. That's the whole album. The soundwave of it looks like ||||||||||| (static). Really disappointing. Trading Pieces is one of my top death metal albums, but I don't really know what happened after that...I guess they stopped singing about violence and lost the touch completely."
1,Come see us for yourself,"Before buying this guide, one must keep in mind that fewer than 2% (25 out of about 1300 students) of the student body completed the surveys Ben distributed. Many students on campus (including myself) feel that parts of this book paint an inaccurate and often negative picture of Reed. The only way to really understand what Reed is about is to take Humanities 110 (the one course all freshmen must take), but failing that, come visit us. Sit in on a few classes, drop by the radio station, spend some time in the pool hall, eat at Commons and the Paradox Café, go to a party, investigate the numerous posters around campus, get a feel for who we are. It only takes a day or two.Reed really is an incredible place, and I would be very sorry if anyone who might benefit themselves and the rest of the student body with their attendance dismissed Reed before getting a decent picture of this unique institution."
1,a reedie complaining about reed? how novel,"i got to listen to this for free for 4 years. but you know. thanks for making a book about it or whatever so other people can pay to read what they can overhear in commons. it's not like most reedies rave about the college anyway. maybe i hung out with an overly pessimistic group, but complaining is what i remember most at reed. followed very distantly by actual work. and yes, i graduated- with only 3.5 years of actual schooling! it can happen! maybe even faster if you don't whine. plz help! i'm locked in an amazing opportunity! oh the pain! oh the suffering of the liberal arts education!"
2,Not the best of klein stripper multitool,"Being an electrician i have used these for about 3 years. The pliers on the tip work ok, and the strippers themselves are ok but klein make alot better strippers than these. The bolt cutters would have to be the best part of these by far they work exactly what you want. The crimpers just don't work very well. You have to put alot a pressure on them to be able to crimp anything, and even after that the insulation can fall off.So my recomendation is if you are going to use these alot by something else. But if you will use these very rarely they will last and will get the job done."
3,Not as listed,"This listing states it is a quantity of 25 items per order. It is only 1 for the listed cost, not 25 containers."
5,Great Add-On,This addition to Carcassonne is SO much fun to play. It took me awhile to get the hang of it but my sister & I play it so much herhusband is going nuts.
5,Good product,Ordered this for my brother and he was happy with it. He is an electrician. Better price than the hardware store too.
3,Poor finishing,"These are a heavy duty plier, but they are very poorly finished and nowhere near the standard of knipex. Which I can get for much the same price."
5,Favourite tool,"I am a technician with a telephone/cable company, and this is by far my favourite tool to reach for. It cuts through anything with ease, whether it be old copper drops or metal drop hangers, and they are sturdy enough that I don't mind using them to hammer a small drive ring in to a pole if I have to. This was my first Klein's tool (bought by my employer) and I like it enough that I just bought a Klein's Diagonal cutter out of my own pocket to use at work. Tried cheaper brand tools and they aren't the same."
4,Great Irish-American Movie,Good Movie. Irish Actor Stephen Rea ( the Crying Game) stars in this Inter-continental Prison Break Saga. I may be a bit bias. I love the star's acting and I love IRISH ACCENTS
5,What a mix.,"This book contained an incredible mix of philosophy, journalism, sociology and psychology. How many writers would have had the skill, let alone the knowledge to pull off a work like this...not many. Regarding its content, the book almost requires its reader to prepare to read it by reading philosophy and history beforehand. I don't know that one could truly appreciate the book without having done that. A couple of the more memorable segments of the book are when Eichmann tries to invoke the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant to justify his actions and those of his comrades and when (on more than one occasion) Arendt poses the haunting question of how the jews could have let themselves be led off to their deaths like lambs to the slaughter. This book warrants more than being read once; multiple readings would be worth the time and effort."
5,"Oh, really.","Amazon.com: in the future, please be sure that your reviewers read more than the back of the book before posting a review; the incompetence of this one was inexcuseable. Arendt, whose ideas have influenced our entire notion of evil and malevolence, writes a thoughtful thesis on the distinction between evil in its mythic and actual forms. An essential read for students of human nature in general and the Holocaust in particular."
2,AN OVER-RATED ACCOUNT,"As a lifelong admirer of Hannah Arendt, especially her thrillingly suggestive ""The Human Condition,"" I was surprised, when I finally picked up her ""Eichmann in Jerusalem,"" to find it a poor account of the subject: disorganized, digressive, meandering. Arendt seems to start the story in the middle and assume too much background from her readers, a fault that grows only more irritating with the distance of time. Every straightforward discussion soon degenerates into a thicket of scholarly throat-clearing and asides. This is the sort of thing best handled by a clear-eyed journalist who starts the story at the beginning, introduces every strand properly, nails every discussion with plenty of concreta, and never abandons the reader. Properly told, it should get more interesting as it proceeds; with Arendt, it only gets more obscure and tiring."
5,A chilling and insightful look into the human mind,"Eichmann in Jerusalem is one of those few books concerning the Holocaust that offers both the historical authenticity of primary texts and analytical perspective of secondary sources. The actual trial itself is, as Arendt has written, surprising in the banality of the defendent, and yet ever more chilling because of it. Arendt herself is an arcute observer and her reflections during the trial offer fresh insights into the mindset of the perpertuators even now. While many of the Holocaust books offer intimidate details on events, few dwelve into the minds of the 'villains' the way Arendt has. I highly recommend this invaluable book, not just for studies of Holocaust, but for anyone who is interested in how the human mind works, and how typical assessment of the these situations fail to account for psychology."
4,Eichmann in??,"The most serious flaw in this work is the lack of detail provided about Eichmann himself. For a book where Eichmann is the central character, it is surprising how little time Arendt devotes to the man himself. Of course, the larger picture of the Nazi killing of the Jews must be provided, but it seems Arednt errs too closely on the macro side, leaving aside the micro. Her propensity to study mass, totalitarian movements left her little prepared to write a biography, or report on a trial of one man.That said, there are some wonderful passages of analysis here, well worth tackling. You can sense Arednt's simmering resentment at every turn, and her spite and rage are a strange pleasure to read. In a world where moral categories are too often drawn in strict black and white, Arednt in Eichmann in Jerusalem was not afraid to write a book almost entirely in gray."
3,Eichmann in Jerusalem,The book offers a look into the trials of Eichmann in Israel. Arednt attempts to explain the banality of evil and how the German people did not react to the tragedies done to the thousands of victims; the evil done within Nazi Germany towards the Jewish people. This book is superb in its explanation and analysis of the role of Eichmann and others like him within the Nazi regime. Arendt does a great job of analyzing Eichmann's psychological condition and attempts to explain why Eichmann did not protest his or the government's actions. It is a Great read - I highly recommend it.
5,Nuclear Terrorism,"Nuclear terrorist are already on the loose. I can only imagine when we will get nuked right here in the greatest nation on earth that cannot protect its citizens from these barbarians who care nothing for their own lives, much less others lives.Convincing and Impressive piece of fiction that should have been nonfiction."
5,Tastes Perfect,This product is great. I made homemade raisin filled cookies for christmas and my family loves them. The filling tastes just like the homemade kind. You can't buy raising pie filling in stores anymore and I don't exactly have the time to cook the raisins and make my own so I tried this product. It's perfect.
5,"A ""Great"" Lake Historian","Wes Oleszewski has become THE historian of Great Lakes adventures. His expert detail and research will take you back in time and put you on board many ill-fated ""lakers."" Anyone who has a remote interest into this subject, will not be disappointed. I especially liked the segment concerning the ""whaleback"" boats of Alexander McDougall. Refreshing in the spirit of Walter Havinghurst!"
5,Cant go wrong with Klein,"Bought these to help with a home theatre install. I used it primarily to strip speaker wire (16 gauge). I have actually used it a few other times around the house and it has worked great. My father has been an electrician for almost 35 years, and he swears by Klein. Now I know why. Great, solid tools at a good price."
5,Wow,"My wife had her nose pieced over 2 months ago. Within a few weeks it looked a little infected and a nasty looking inflammation appeared around the piercing (she knows the medical term for it, I don't). She cleaned it with sea salt up to 6 times a day which seemed to do nothing. I stumbled upon this product while searching for quality nose ring and read some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I made the purchase but I was extremely skeptical. Well it's been about 3 days since she starting using it and the irritation has almost completely disappeared. I'm very impressed with this product! I think I earned some brownie points with my wife too."
5,Great stuff :),"I got two piercings at the same time, side by side on my cartilage. It swelled and became infected within four days (granted I wasn't taking good care of it so the blame is all on me.) I began cleaning it with antibacterial soap and hot water which did help (along with antibiotics) but it dried my ear out a bit. I began using H2Ocean more often instead of the soap and it worked just as well! I like this better actually because it saves me the trouble of having to boil water and mix the soap and wait for it to cool so I don't burn my ear (yes laziness!) Now I only use antibacterial soap on my piercings once while I'm taking a hot shower and use H2Ocean during the rest of the day. I just spray some on both sides of my cartilage and I'm done! And since the can isn't too big, I can carry it with me and spray it as needed! :)"
5,Good stuff.,I bought this quite a while back to care for my septum piercing and am only just now getting around to writing a review. But it worked great! And I used it for other new piercing I got as well.
5,This stuff rocks socks.,"H2Ocean hasn't miraculously cured any infections for me or anything. That's because I haven't had any for it to cure. However, it's really good for just spraying my belly ring when the crusties start to stick the ring to the hole (uncomfortable and not good for healing) or if I don't have time to wash my piercing before my first class of the morning. And, let's face it, H2Ocean just *smells* like it works. It smells like salty ocean and happy belly button."
2,Did not work,I was so excited to use this because I read really good reviews on it unfortunately this made my navel piecing 10 times worse ill stick to sea salt soaks from now on
2,A good product in theory...,"I had my cartilage pierced about 8 months ago, and the lady who pierced my ear recommended that I purchase H2ocean to clean my ear. My ear was fine with using H2ocean for about two months before it got infected. I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month. Despite warning against using alcohol on the area, I finally decided to just switch to using an alcohol-based toner solution that cleared up my infection within a week! H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn't really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean! The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer. Good luck!"
2,Just OK,A little disappointed. All the reviews I read make it sound like it worked right away and would get rid of the bump around the hole. I really am surprised to see all the 5-star ratings. I have an ear piercing that is not in the regular cartilege. It hasn't changed much in a month and I use is 3 or 4 times a day. It keeps it clean though.
2,Good product..rip off seller,I'm giving the seller 2 stars not because the product isn't great but because of the seller's $8 shipping charge. The shipping for this product was just as much as it's cost...this is ridiculous and a rip off.
5,an essential with nipple piercing's,I've had my nipples pierced for about 2 years and they still get infected every once in awhile and ever since I've been using this product they havent got infected and I wish had got this stuff when I first got them pierced. So I very highly recommend this product for any body with nipple piercings.
5,great stuff,"my daughter had her belly button pierced and I was very worried about infection setting in. The ocean spray has kept it in top shape, it's a great product."
5,Cleans piercings well.,"I felt this was a good product for cleaning my piercings. Doing a little soak made even the pain lessen along with healing any irritations I might have had from minor bumps to my fresh piercing.The only thing I dislike is the price, but I would recommend this product."
5,Wonderful,This product worked absolutely amazing! After just about a week of using it for my nipple piercings the lil tiny keloids went away. I highly recommend this product to anyone with piercings
2,product itself works well but...,"The spray itself works fine but the packaging it came in was very poor. It was a plain manila envelope, without any extra packaging which caused the cap to arrive shattered. For the most part it's not a huge deal, but when traveling/moving it's a pain to have to worry about whether or not something will make it spray off in my bag. The lack of care when mailing gave me a poor inpression of this seller."
2,Could be better,"The product was delivered very quickly which I loved. But the nozzle was defective.. the seller was apologetic and offered some suggestions as to how to fix the nozzle. That didn't work and now I am left with a full can of h2ocea. That is completely useless to me. Perhaps it was just my bottle that was defective. In terms of delivery, I would say the seller did a great job at getting it to me quickly. Too bad."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,This product did exactly what I was hoping !! Plus it was at a Fantastic Price !!! I would definitely recommend this Product !
5,truly a miracle!,"I was skeptical this product would work as I have tried numerous things to try to help heal my helix that I've had for months with no luck. After reading how many positive reviews there were, I just had to give it a shot as I was just going to let my helix close and get it re-pierced. within a day or so of use , I'd say the crusts went away and it wasn't sore and reddened. Not only do the crusts go away, but it makes it easy to remove because they don't seem to harden with this product. In addition to my helix, I have been using it on my new Tragus as well as my snug to reduce inflammation and it's truly a miracle product! I'm getting a rook piercing within the next few days, so I just bought a second bottle; you can never be without this item! I WOULDN'T RATE SOMETHING SO HIGHLY AND BUY FOR A SECOND TIME IF I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WASN'T GREAT!I will buy yet another when I reach the end of the bottle, I couldn't ask for a cheaper more beneficial product! THANK YOU!"
5,Amazingg for nose piercings,"I recently got my nose pierced and shortly after my nose got infected, a lot of people recommended this spray so i tryed it, it works amazing after a couple days my nose was not infected anymore. Great for piercings!"
4,Quick and effective,"I got my navel pierced and the spray was recommended. Nothing beats salt water soaks using a shot glass, but I'd recommend this for ease-of-use and portability. I recently went on a trip for a long weekend and found it very convenient."
5,Don't waste your time or money with any other piercing after care,"This product is AMAZING.I have my industrial pierced and I got the dreaded bump.My bar is way to big for my little ear so it got bumped around ALOT.I got a nasty looking blood boil and the piercing was starting to get infected.I soaked a cotton ball and put it in my ear. I also took a piece of cotton and rolled it around the top of my piercing so it wouldn't get bumped around. I would soak the piece of cotton throughout the day.THIS STUFF DOES WONDERS. It's been 2 days and my piercing is completely normal now.Just spray your piercing, and for the love of God, leave it alone!"
5,Travel Size Awesomeness,I have several piercings and have used H2Ocean since the first puncture. Works great! Recently got a new one and I like to carry a 1.5 oz can in my purse so I can spray it on when needed.
4,"AMAZING for healing, but found something that works better.","I recently bought another bottle of this because my small one that was given to my by my piercer ran out. It did help heal my belly button piercing, HOWEVER I found that Witch Hazel actually works better. I've been using the Dickinson's Witch Hazel and It's almost fully healed!! This product does help though, and especially for a fresh piercing, I would recommend it."
5,Just what I needed,I ran out of H2O ocean and no one sells the 4oz bottles by me. Ordered it. Shipped fast. My piercings feel much better :)
5,H20cean,"I really wanted a belly button peircing but I was worried about infection. After I researched it and found a safe place, I decided to do it. It got a little irritated on the third day, and then I heard about H2Ocean. I got it and the irritation was gone! It cleans the area, makes it less crusty, and this is gross, but it gets all of the icky stuff out from the inside which is really good for healing. All you have to do is spray it on a couple times a day. I have extremly sensitive skin, but I have not had one infection while using H20cean."
2,Not my favorite for ears...,I got this to use while stretching my ears. I found that using a $1.99 bottle of nose saline worked just as well if not better. The spray nozzle on this sprays instead of streams so it goes everywhere including into the ear canal. Not my favorite...
2,Ummmm . . .,"IDK why but it seem like this didn't help my piercing at all . Saline Solution works better to me than this, & when my belly ring got infected it seemed like it made it worse . Maybe it's just my body . IDK ."
2,Not impressed,"Not impressed at all! Product didn't seem to help with piercings almost seemed to make it worse and dry (hurt) had to stop using and switch to another product, didn't work good for me"
2,Worked great at first..,When I first received the product it worked like a charm; however after about a month the spray broke and I couldn't use the rest of it. ):
2,Made my piercing worse,"I got this to help keep my bellybutton ring clean during the day when I couldn't do salt water soaks. A day or two after I started using it a big red bump appeared around the top of the piercing, and was bleeding. So after another day or two of using H2O I stopped and went back to just salt water soaks, it's fine and back to normal now. I'm not sure what the problem was but H2O did not help any, if anything it made it worse. But I'll keep it around, only because you CANT return it."
5,classic disney game,i got this game as an adult but it didnt matter i enjoyed every second of the only thing is its to short when i beat the game i was like really its over i think it has only 5 boards but definately worth but i would get it used 50 bucks is a little to high
5,Great product,Really good quality! Looks just like the picture and is of great quality!! Comes with a lot of good hints in order to get on airplane.
3,Good pet bag,"THe product is stiurdy, well ventilated and easily accepted by the airlines. I gave it 3 stars becasue is is difficult to stuff under the seat unless you are in first class"
5,Like old wine that improves with years,"Since Ofrah Haza suddenly and sadly past away, it's a good time to start collecting her albums and giving the respect she has earned. This Album - ""Adama"" - earth, is probably the most safisticated album she ever had. Using the top Israeli writers and composers, Ofra takes us to a journey of passion, exotic and warmth in the trails she knows the best, her own trails. Yemenite background, Israeli color and a voice that is one of a kind. Eventhough it was realeases more then 10 years ago, it's simpley one of her best. The words have a new meening as well... like ""someone is always walking with me"" and ""mother earth"". Run to buy it, listen to it, listen and listen and listen, It will never leave your stereo system."
3,YOU STILL NEED SUBTITLES....,"You still need subtitles, so what is the point of singing it in English? Certainly, artists like Janet Baker and Rosalind Plowright could sing in Italian ""like everybody else"". Mostly, I find that the sounds of English do not go very well with music that was meant to be sung in Italian. I tried to watch the DVD with Italian subtitles, i.e. I tried to hear it in its original language; it did not work that well. In the end, I could not wait for Janet Baker to be beheaded; she was (not on stage though).I much prefer the Maria Stuarda from La Scala, with Anna Caterina Antonacci and Mariella Devia, although the staging and the costumes are not as nice (not as expensive). If you like Janet Baker, you may want to buy Owen Wingrave (1970) or The Beggar's Opera (1963), both in The Britten-Pears Collection (Decca), both available from Amazon."
4,Butterfly pillow,Bought this to go along with a butterfly necklace as a gift. The pillow was absolutely loved and the little flowers and stars comes off and you are able to reposition them on the pillow. Fun present!
5,Great Product,This is a great product! Does everything it says- no problems. I feel the out loud verbal directions is a must in the navigation system! Very user friendly! Highly Recommend this one!
5,Best GPS at lowest price! Highly recommended.,"I was initially skeptical to buy a GPS because I thought it would make you not notice the routes you were taking and hence would make you retarded! I have definitely grown out of that ideology after I bought this GPS. Apart from it being sleek and with a clear display, my favorite feature about this GPS is the fact that it announces the street names that you have to turn into, ensuring that you know which roads you took! This is the cheapest GPS that you can find with all the features as competitor products with similar features price at atleast 70$ more! I would highly recommend this GPS to anyone who wants a value-for-money GPS."
3,"Neat toy, but...","The set up was effortless, but don't bother trying to use it until you've updated it. Unless you live in a major metropolis, this device will not have your address. My home has been built for over 5 years and my street doesn't exist in this device. In addition, it does not provide the closest routes to major shopping centers or points of interest. I could see on the map provided a shorter route, but the system provided a much longer ""fast"" route. Enjoy, but use with caution. Compared to other models, this one is the low priced option... for a good reason."
4,Magellan Maestro 3140 a great GPS at a great price,"Got this about a month ago, and I have to say it seems to be a great GPS for the price I paid ($177). Works well, easy to use, quick satellite acquisition without loss, even in some parking structures or surrounded by the buildings in Vegas. Nice features, including Bluetooth, for the price, plus you get double the warranty if you are a AAA member. Only wishes that I have: that it came with an ac to dc charger/adapter (I bought one on Amazon that appeared to be both, but it doesn't charge, just powers it); and the mount could be a bit easier to use. Otherwise, I love it and would purchase it again."
3,Portable GPS,"Received the GPS and the screen did not work. I notified the seller immediately. I was told to return the unit for a refund, but had to pay to ship it back. There are two issues here: The unit was damaged when I received it. I don't think I should have had to pay to send it back to get a refund."
4,GPS,"I sent it back and got a Garmin.Now, my reason was only because the Garmin had a feature that this one lacked. As far as startup time, the Magellan BLOWS THE GARMIN AWAY! If I were to by a new unit, I'd probably get a Magellan. Too much time wasted with the Garmin."
2,Inconsistent,"I researched GPS' before settling on this one, as it received good reviews. It was such a mistake. The day I got it I drove 3 blocks then put in my home address. It got me to the intersection then said to turn left - my house was on the right! It would not re-route me if I made a mistake - just kept telling me to turn around. One time it took me to the airport parking lot instead of my destination five miles away. It then began locking on previous destinations and it took minutes for the unit to re-program. Finally, after 18 months, it froze permanently. I called Magellan and they said it would cost more to fix it than it cost. I purchased a Garmin Nuvi and love it!"
2,Magellan Maestro 3140 GPS,"Worked ok, but maps were not as good or as accurate as my Handheld Garmin GPS. No longer own it."
5,How did we ever live without this???,We absolutely LOVE this GPS! We are so glad we got it. It makes travel/ day trips a breeze!It was so simple to use right out of the box!
1,Overpriced piece of junk,"I don't know how much you have to spend to get a decent GPS. Some inexpensive GPS devices get 5 star reviews while more expensive units get low reviews. In this case, this unit performs horribly for its intended task, since it freezes every time it tries to calculate a route in New York City. For a device that can't do it's basic function I give this a 1 star.More annoyingly though is the cheapness of MAgellan not to even include an AC adapter to charge the GPS at home, given that the first screen you get at bootup says how dangerous it is to program the GPS in your car while driving!!!!Customer service is awful, as anyone on this site can attest to.If anyone has a better suggestion for a GPS please respond. If this is supposed to be one of the better units out there, what can I expect for less money?"
3,Non-existent Magellan customer support,"I bought this Magellan Maestro 3140 over 2 months ago from Amazon. I like the product, but I PRAY nothing goes wrong with it so that I would have to send it to Magellan. I bought an accessory for it directly from Magellan, received the wrong accessory, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to return the item to Magellan for any refund. I've been trying for over a month to get a return authorization for it. 20 emails and 5 conversations with a foreign call center (sounds like Saudi Arabia and they obviously have difficulty comprehending) and everything goes in one ear and out the other with them. So, unless you are able to order through Amazon and return to them if anything goes wrong, forget about dealing with Magellan."
4,Great product for the price,"As my first GPS purchase, this device has everything that I was looking for. It functions well and is easy to use. The screen size is sufficient and the display layout works well. The text-to-speech capability is quite helpful and the voice is clear and easy to understand. As with any GPS device, the routes the device calculates sometimes aren't the most direct, but the routes it has provided me have always get me to my destination accurately. On the downside, one needs to keep in mind that the maps in this device are from late 2006 and are scheduled to be updated later this year (addt'l cost ~$70). The AAA tourbook is also a bit outdated, but can be updated for free if one is a AAA member. Overall, the features and performance of this device can't be beat for the price I paid ($149)."
2,Website/Customer service is a joke.,"I bought this product to use with my boat and car since it is advertised as being marine capable. What they don't tell you is that the marine maps do not come with the unit and must be purchased from their website. Here is the problem. I purchased a downloadable version of a marine map online which states it will only take minutes to download. Well, here it is 11 days later and still not able to download. I have been on the phone with their obviously overseas customer support staff over five times, and many hours with them trying to resolve this issue. To make a long story short, the website does not work when trying to download. If you do buy this product and wish to purchase a map, order the SD card version and have it shipped through the mail. Don't fall into the same trap I did."
2,Ready to pay extra for Map Updates,I bought this Costco and have used it fairly across USA and Canada. Though the product is fine there are some quirks that everyone should know about -[1] Wall Charger is not included. Unit takes around 3 hours in the car to be charged completely.[2] Updates need a full battery. Quite difficult if you dont have an AC Charger.[3] Map updates cost $79.99.[4] Non-existent Magellan customer service.[5] Slow GPS acquisition.[6] No MP3 support.This will be my last Magellan product. Period.I dont think I will ever pay to update a closed dedicated piece of hardware. A good day-to-day example would be Microsoft charging you $$$$$ to send OS updates.
5,Magellan Maestro 3140 GPS,"This is an amazing unit, plug and use with no setup needed. It has made my driving anywhere so much easier and I believe everyone shouild have a GPS and of all the units available I like Magellan the best. I have had one for about 4-5 years and it has saved my sanity several times."
5,Magellan Maestro 3140 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,Its great one from amazon but drawback is little late to get signal great bluetooth no noise nothing good one from amazon for great price
1,way too hard to set up and use,Magellan Maestro 3140 Portable Auto GPS System for U.S./Canada/Puerto Ricosetting this up and attempting to make it work was very difficultI returned this and bought a Garmin which is much easier and customer friendly
2,Ouch. Ear-grating. Quite annonying for kids and adults.,"I dread--truly dread--when these tracks come along. They're just painfully cheesy and lite. I am reminded of Velveeta and Muzak rolled into one. The whole thing with times tables in song, is that a good one begs you to sing along. You find yourself singing along, tapping your toes, humming the tune even when you're not listening to it. I grew up on Hap Palmer, but I'll bet there's something even better. Shop around, and skip this one."
2,It's not worth for REALLY learning the Language,"My dad got this for me because i like to learn languages. It was misleading for me what is says on the package ""each disc a complete course"". It is useful for you if you want to learn basic things like phrases for traveling but NOT if you REALLY want to learn the language. If want to learn basic travel things this WILL be for you. But if you want to REALLY Learn the language you better get the Instant Immersion Laguage course devoted to one language.From PaulFlorida"
5,Another gift from my husband,A great Rye Bread book. The number of recipies is tremendious and all look and sound wonderful and leaving you want to try them all immediately and wondering which to choose first. It's a keeper!
2,"I DON'T LIKE IT, WISH I NEVER BOUGHT IT","I HAVE MANY MANY BREAD BOOKS, THIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF MY LIST. i DON'T LIKE THE FORMAT, IN FACT I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THE BOOK."
3,"Not the best book on Orlando, but worth the read...","If you are looking for the definative guide to all things Disney and Universal, this is not your book. In fact, you'd be much better off with ""The Unofficial Guide.""But, if you are looking for the quirky and less well populated, the odd and the sublime, and sites which will give you a taste of the ""old"" Florida, this book can be worth the read.It provides good information on many of the area attractions which are not so ""Disney""-fied, but be prepared -- due to the age of this edition you may need to make some phone calls to verify these places are still in operation."
5,More good Tile play,"If you like Carcassone, you will like this version. It has a little different play features, and is a great addition to the game collection."
2,Am I missing something?,"I bought this game because I love board games and I though I'd try something new. I particularly like Settlers of Catan, Diplomacy and Risk. I've only played Hunters & Gatherers a few times and it seems way too simple. Is this game aimed at younger kids? Do I need to play it more to pick up on strategies that I'm missing? Maybe this game is better for people who don't enjoy more complicated games."
5,Have red it in one run - - - !,"Fun to read at first! Brief, packed only with importanant facts.I had to laugh from first to last page - even though I was often aware I'm laughin at myself, sarcastically and ironically (which is main base of czech humour,too) .I can't deny anything written there, just being it a shortcut and siplification in a way - which it just the way it was meant to be.-I'm born & living in Czech Republic."
3,Helpful!,"Yes, I agree that MacArthur is promoting his study bible. I find no fault with that. It is up to the reader to decide whether to buy it or not. But I will say that I found this volume helpful."
2,Poor Guide,"As with many of John MacArthur's books, he seemingly takes an awful long time to get to the subject matter of the titles to his books. I feel that he takes far too long (10 Chapters out of 17 total) in giving background issues about the Bible and its history and much too little time in teaching about ""How to Get the Most from God's Word"". Once again I am very disappointed with his method and content in dealing with the subject matter. There are many more excellent books available which deal with this subject far more realistically than MacArthur does.He is also guilty of accusing others of being ""people who want to remove this verse or some other verse from Scripture"", when he himself is a Cessationist and deletes whole chunks of 1Corinthians to suit his particular viewpoint. In my book that's biblical hypocrisy!"
5,A Must Read For Everyone,"What an amazing book. It is the best book I have ever read in my life. I learned so much about my life and about the Universe that I have changed my life drastically. It does not matter what race, political party, or even religion you are associated with. Everyone can learn something from this book.James is a wonderful author. He takes the complex concepts and make them understandable without dumbing them down. James explains everything in his book from how the Universe works to how people work. Did you know that everything including the Universe vibrates? My life has changed big time and I like it.If you are a skeptic, the book may start off a little ""WTF"", but before you know it, the ideas and concepts begin to make more sense than anything you have ever read. A must read for everyone."
3,Anatomy of positive attitude,"The book has some views and dogmas of its own. The author has done a good job of putting forth his views. But, then it lacks quality, in the sense, not many ideas seem to be profound. The ironic thing about this book is, though it speaks so much on the postive attitude towards life, the examples used for ilustration had so much to do with negativity. On the whole, one can learn some of the priciples, which can be applied to daily life."
2,"Good concepts, poorly organized","This book presents some good concepts but in a wandering, disorganized fashion. It could use some serious editing, and the same material could have been covered much more concisely."
3,Good but...,This is a good book but I found it a bit philosophical and not as practical as FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz. I would suggest reading both of them together.
1,Good Layout Doesn't Make Up For Poor Content,"I purchased this book when I bought Visio and regret it. In a hurry, I glanced through the table of contents and it looked complete. I also skimmed through the pages, and the layout looked clear and well done. All of this was on quick inspection. Once I started reading the book, I couldn't believe I got snookered into buying it from these things. This author can't write her way out of a wet paper bag, and I seriously doubt that she can even use Visio. I took the book back. Don't make my mistake."
2,Not much of Everything,"This book contains massive typographical errors. Many of the illustrations don't match the text. A lot of the operational instructions do not match the menu and tool options in the actual software.I purchased the book to learn how to create a new shape. Chapter 9 has a paragraph entitled ""Creating an Entirely New Shape"" but only tells you how to modify an existing shape. At no time does it explain how to create a new shape from scratch."
2,Incorrect Quantity,"I just opened the package today. I looked through it, and I only see one controller, and I ordered two. I was, however, charged for the correct quantity, so I need to have this fixed.The controller that was delivered is working, so hopefully that continues. The rating would have been higher, but I do not like being charged for items that have not been delivered. And I checked my e-mails to make sure that I did not get a message of a delayed delivery."
3,sort of misleading actually really misleading,when i ordered the product i got a 3 button controller but from the image on the page i was expecting a 6 button controller. its fine but it was really misleading
2,Order Abruptly Cancelled,"I was very upset to go through the whole ordering & billing process, only to have the order cancelled 2 days later. Boooooo"
5,we all sparkle and fade,"i don't know why that other person was so negative because i have the same book. and regradless of what he said i believe that book is outstanding. Warner Bros. is the publishing company and i have always trusted them with all of my books, from Collective Soul to Jewel. they have, in this book, all of the songs that you would find in the second album and i would recommend this book to anybody that likes to play this type of music."
4,brilliant razor handle,"The razor handle is of a solid heft and the weight of the handle alone will suffice to move the blades across your face. The handle is a good 16cm, or 6.5 inches or so for you Americans. The construction leads me to believe I will have this for a very long time, the solidness of the handle cannot be overemphasized. The balance is keen, placed at the large end of handle.Although this may be inconsequential in some circles, I feel the handle could be a very effective self-defense weapon. I travel a great deal and have stayed in places where an additional weapon, especially in the washroom, would have been gladly had.I didn't give this razor handle 5 stars because the metal working is visible on the surface and under light. I would have liked to have seen more of a polish. The handle is more utilitarian than a piece for esthetic purpose."
3,Nat's Words,"What makes this date a gem is Nat's commentaries on the music and his special relationship with his brother, Julian. The band is in fine form and Vincent Herring is playing his butt off, not copying Cannon, but showing the same enthusiasm, but the story here is what Nat has to say, not play. No one could tell a story better than the Adderley brothers and Nat tells some stories here."
1,a skinned rabbit,"Ye gads, as I was looking for a poncho I find something made out of fur. An animal is killed and skinned for what? A helpless animal, at that. Bred for death, confined for life, and maybe the end by having a neck broken or anal electrocution. Is that what we do to creatures for people's fashion? Well, not me. It is a shame that there is no compassion at Amazon, otherwise this wouldn't be shown. For those that buy this cruelty filled product, often try and think how it was made. Perhaps 40 live rabbits were hand-killed and skinned for this baby. Wear it proudly, knowing that you contribute to the worst in people and the deaths of the helpless creatures."
1,Please Choose Compassion!,"With all of the elegant and warm synthetics available these days, there's no reason for anyone to wear fur. I can't tell you how disappointed I am that Amazon would offer such a cruel product. To anyone considering purchasing one of these monstrosities, please think hard about how much suffering went into each and every one of them."
1,Thinking about buying this fur poncho?,"Before you decide to purchase this rabbit fur poncho, or any other product made of fur or containing fur trim, you might want to consider the following: In addition to the millions of of wild animals who are viciously trapped for their fur, untold numbers of dogs, cats, birds, and other ""nontarget"" animals are also mutilated and killed in barbaric leghold and body-gripping traps that were set for others. Fur-bearing animals are killed each year on fur farms by anal and vaginal electrocution and in the wild by drowning, trapping, or beating. By wearing this poncho you will be covering yourself with the skin and fur of a tortured dead animal. Please make a statement on behalf of our animal friends and do not wear or buy fur. COMPASSION IS FASHION!"
1,Unbelievable,"I've known many rabbits in my life and I haven't been tempted to wear one of them. They are shy, caring creatures who bond with their humans and show joy by grinding their teeth or leaping in the air. The thought of murdering even one of these animals just to satisfy someone's vanity is abhorrent. How would you feel if you saw a ""Women's Cat Fur Poncho"" on sale? What about reading that ""cat and dog fur is all the rage in the fashion industry and with people in the know""--would you even be tempted to buy such horrible products? Think about it. ALL animals are feeling creatures who do not deserve to die because their fur might make someone look cute or popular. Don't put your selfish interest above all else--be a caring human being. It might just save the planet."
1,A waste of animal lives.,"Santa wears faux, why shouldn't we? Have a happy holiday without harming animals and choose cruelty-free alternatives to fur!"
1,FUR IS DEAD!!!! This is an ATROCITY - AMAZON WAKE UP!,How many rabbits had to die to make this poncho???? I thought Amazon was much more aware and I am very disappointed!
4,warm and chic,"This item is really warm and cozy and for the price you cannot get more luxurious than this. Belive me, cows are not extinct thanks to the fact that we eat them if you are thinking this is animal cruelty. Remember that leather and wool come from animals and people still wear them. Plus, sheep are not killed for their fur as it can be with rabbits, since the shedding is used to weave with wool. Down, an animal product from geese,is also used and loved by everyone because of its warmth and coziness and I do not see anyone complaining about cruelty or wasted animals in this case, only when rodents, RODENTS, are in question, everyone goes berserk. Do not judge without knowing how it is made."
1,Cut Little Rabbits Were Killed for This!,Hundreds of millions of rabbits are slaughtered for their fur and their flesh every year. They are often killed by having their necks snapped or having their skulls beaten before being strung up by the legs and having their heads cut off.
4,Only Worth $19.99,"This is a very strange racing game. It is based in the futurewith you driving a racer floating on air. Graphics are not thatgood, however what can you expect from a game that retails for$19.99. In a strange way this racer is enjoyable in mostlythe multiplayer mode. If you enjoy racing games like I do,it is a good game for the money."
4,A great album but not the VU's best.,"Loaded is full of classics. Sweet Jane and Rock and Roll of course come to mind. But other songs such as New Age and Oh Sweet Nuthin' also deserve mention. The problem with this release was that it was not much different than it's predecessor ""Velvet Underground"", only the songs are weaker. The great thing about the first three VU releases were that they were markedly different from one another. Also Cale's influence on this album is sorely missed as the songs sound more commercial on Loaded than on any of the first three releases."
2,I love the Velvets...,"But this would have worked so much better as a Lou Reed solo album. After 3 masterful albums, including one that could make a serious claim as the best of all time, with another as the most inifluential, they put out this poppy rock album that was so loaded with pop tunes it largely overshadows whatever merits it has. As far as being avante-garde, it doesn't compare to their first two albums at all. As far as stripped down rock songs go, their third album destroys ""Loaded."" The actual sounds remind me mmore of Lou Reed's solo stuff, like ""New York"" or ""Transformer,"" only I think those albums had more passion and guts than this one. But, still, it has it's merits. The songs aren't terrible, though none are great. The real problem I have with the album is the name. As a Lou Reed solo album I wouldn't be so harsh. As a Velvet Underground album, it fails miserably. I wouldn't trade a single ""Venus in Furs"" or ""Sister Ray"" for this entire album, and that should never happen."
4,Loaded with Lou Reed's soon to be signature sound,"""Loaded"" is the least sounding Velvet Underground album. With the departure of John Cale, The Velvets lost their creative avant-garde force and Lou Reed took over making a solid album that would establish Lou Reed's sound for better or worst (depending on your opinion). While I can't say this is as good as the last three VU albums were, it definitely has its moments. Songs like ""Who Loves The Sun"" and ""Oh Sweet Nuthin'"" would make it on my list of favorite VU songs. ""Sweet Jane"" is probably Lou Reed's most classic song. ""Rock And Roll"" tells the tale of rock and roll in its finest glory. ""Head Held High"" shows a more powerful side of Lou Reed, vocally. ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"" is a display of good country like The Byrds and Bob Dylan have done before. Overall this album is more solid and well produced than the first three albums but lacks the high energy and creative force that made The Velvet Underground different from the rest."
3,Lou Reed comes into his own,"I'd like to give this more stars just for ""Sweet Jane"", but you probably know ""Sweet Jane"" already. Or maybe not, so: ""Sweet Jane"" very strongly evokes middle-sixties Bob Dylan (""Bringing it Back Home"", Highway 61 Revisted"", ""Blonde on Blonde"") in its vocal mannerisms (especially), its lyrical imagery, and its music. It isn't terribly original then, but it IS terribly good...Ooops! Sounds like a contradiction in terms....It is VERY good. ""Rock and Roll"" is punchy; ""Who Loves the Sun"" is mildly amusing; unfortunately, the rest of ""Loaded"" isn't really worth listening to once.Recommended: Lou Reed's ""The Blue Mask"", his ""Legendary Hearts"", his ""New Sensations"" and, for musicians, ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns."
5,"Doesn't sound like the Velvets, but Velvets nonetheless ....","To be honest, I was disappointed listening to this album. The first three Velvet Underground LPs I would've rated 7 stars out of five if I could have, and I'd heard that ""Loaded"" was ""loaded with hits"" ... it lacks the distinctive Velvet Underground sound, but as a classic rock album it still whips the hell out of most everything out there ... ""Wild Cowboy Bill"" is actually reminiscent of the Grateful Dead, and ""Who Loves the Sun"" sounds like Hollies-esque pop. The highlights of the album are the definitive ""Sweet Jane"" and the sweet slow final jam ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'""."
2,what a joke,"thought to be a lost album among the other amazing velvet underground records, i was very excited to have came across this record. this record is almost done with the second song on the second side and i am incredibley dissapointed already. This album lacks a great deal of substance that the others had. It is complete studio pop from 1970. lou reeds vocals have changed so much since their debut album. for some odd reason he thought rock and roll growls were the way to go on this one. the only songs that i found had potential were ""who loves the sun"" and head held high. now that the third song on the second side is playing, i realize that there is no hope for this album. im sorry lou but john cale was the real man behind the velvet underground. buy "" the velvet underground and nico"" first. you can almost disregard this as the real deal. thanks."
5,one of the top ten rock n roll records of all time,ok so vu is known mostly for vu and nico but i think this is one of there best all around albums i mean i can listen to it from start to finish over and over agian lou reed is with out a doubt one of the best songwriters of all time and songs like o sweet nuthin and rock n roll and one of the best rock n roll songs over sweet jane i mean this album is what i think of when i think good all around albums now i would say vu and nico is there 2nd best album but if your lookin for your money worths you want velvet underground loaded its a masterpeice
4,Loaded But Uneven Too,"Yes, Loaded has Sweet Jane and Rock 'n Roll, two of the Velvets' or anyone's best, but also contains quite a bit of pedestrian work. New Age is interesting, and Oh Sweet Nothing has its moments, but I can't be on the bandwagon that the rest of the album is brilliant. This is by no means to say it is sub-par work, for Lou has difficulty writing a bad song. And the overall image of Loaded to me remains the brilliance of Sweet Jane and Rock 'n Roll."
3,half of this album is incredible the other half is average,"this album starts out with one of the most incredible 1-2-3 punches of all time. the first three songs (who loves the sun, sweet jane, and rock and roll) will all blow you away. the song new age is also incredible, but after that the album has a bunch of weird or bad songs. i don't like the song lonesome cowboy bill at all. if you get the version with the studio out-takes has some amazing songs on it. the early versions of satelite of love and sad song are much better than the versions on lou's solo albums."
3,The back-to-front Velvet Underground,"Perversely, this sounds like an album a fairly conventional rock band would have made before being bold enough to record more experimental albums like 'White Light, White Heat', and 'The Velvet Underground & Nico' later on in their career. It's not that it's bad; it just isn't, well, different enough to warrant being listed as an Essential album. Get their debut album first."
4,An okay port of Turrican 2.,"Many Turrican fans make fun of this game, I cannot blame them, I do so all of the time. ""What happens when you take Turrican 2, get rid of the spaceship levels, replace them with bad levels and change a few of the sprites? THIS THING!"" However, the game isn't badly programmed, the music is well converted (for the most part) and overall, it's Turrican 2! It also adds a few cool details to the game as well, but I'll let you find those on your own. If you want a game directly based off of the movie, you have come to the wrong place. This game makes no sense when you compare it to the movie (which makes little sense to begin with!) simply because the scenes do not match up at all. It's much better than the movie (after all it is Turrican 2!). If you give this one a chance, it can be fun. However, if you can get an Amiga with Turrican 2 instead, you won't be missing much!7.75/10"
1,Warning may cause headaches,Universal Soldier with Van Damme & Lundgren rocks the game sucks it takes Turrican 2 and it puts characters from the movie in it. It doesn't even resemble the movie like most licenced based games but at least most movie based games I have reviewed are good like Alien 3 Batman The Terminator on Sega CD & Judge Dredd. The controlls are bad to fire automatically you must come to a complete stop & hold A & there is a 1 second delay & that second delay can lead to you getting getting a** r***ed by so much s**t attacking you in every direction. Van Damme didn't use guns in the movie that much why couldn't this have been a beat em up. You know Van Damme just used martial arts in the movie. Level 7 is the only thing that looks like the movie. Level 10 is a f***ed up version of the Alien den in Contra. You either die by the Sushi of death or aliens driving the hybrid vehicles of death.
5,"Great game, easy to learn and fast to play!",I bought this for a 13 year old I didn't know well in hopes that we could all enjoy it together. I was right. Everyone could play with no problems and winners rotated. Yeh!
4,Good introduction to train games,A great gateway game. Easy to learn and quick to play. There is a good mix of strategy and luck.
5,TransAmerica is a great game for the whole family,"This is a very fun game with very simple rules. It takes about 5 minutes to learn the game or teach it, and it is fun for a wide range of ages and gaming skills. I got this for my Mum over Thanksgiving and all of the family was able to play it and enjoy the game.It is also quasi cooperative, so there is no player elimination and no direct agression between players, making it a great family game.While it is a light game in terms of strategy and complexity, it makes up for this by being fun and easy to get non-gamers to play."
1,Not a strategy game,"Hi, as a board game collector, I can tell you that this is one of the most boring games I had purchased.The strategy to win this game is almost null and to win you just must be lucky, no smart.I first played it only with my girlfriend and at the end of the game both of us were laughing, but not because it was fun but because it was pointless. I though that maybe playing with more people will be better but after two more tries with 4 and 5 players the outcoming was the same, it's a boring and nonsense game, at least compared with games as Puerto Rico, Settlers, Bohnanza, etc.So if you're looking for a good and challenging game, look elsewhere. And if you're looking to learn USA state names, search for an Atlas.This is not a fun, neither interesting game. And for the same price you can purchase excellent board games. Best regards."
2,Looking for great strategy game.......not here.,"For guys game night every week we play a whole host of strategy games. When you see the ""people who viewed this also viewed these games"" list we basically own and have played all of them with the expansions. One of the guys got this as a present and it was played that day and only once since. The second time we came up with a bunch of our own rules and guidelnes to make it remotely strategic and fun. After that we went back to our Settlers of Catan, Acquire, Puerto Rico, San Juan, Bohnanza, Ticket to Ride, Ruise and Bruise, Carcassone and......................."
3,Better than settlers?,"Is it better than settlers? Ehe. If I wrote this review 2 months ago, I would have sworn this was a great game. Light, fast paced, high player interaction, explained in 2 minutes, played in 20 minutes. However, after two months of play I have seen some glaring flaws. The luck element is just too high. I have played a game where the lucky winner went out in the first round - a five minute game with no strategy. I have then played a game that lasted an hour and a half and bored everyone to tears do only to bad luck in darwing the destinations.Bottom Line: Is it fun? yes. Is it worth buying for a couple of months. Sure. Is it for kids? As long as they can read."
5,Great simple game,"It should be noted, TransAmerica is one of my longstanding favorites. It is quick playing, fun, and it handles 6 as well as it handles 2. The last review is very detailed so I will not duplicate - but this is not a 6 hour super strategy game, this is a fun 30 minute filler game that can be played over and over."
3,'Highs Of The '60's' - Various Artists (Warner Bros.),"Twenty track budget-friendly various artist CD of many good songs by plenty of your favorite one-hit and two-hit wonders like Electric Prunes, Count Five, Blue Cheer, The Seeds, Beau Brummels, Kingsmen among others. Most of the tunes here are of the mentioned band's best known songs. A few artists offer a 'deep album cut' - like the Association's ""Six Man Band"" and the Standell's ""Sometimes Good Guys Don't Where White""."
3,"Welcome back, Kotter.","I loved Leading Change, but I just couldn't seem to get so into this book. Yes, it's good to give people a ""sense of urgency"" to get things done. But can that sense of urgency really come from anything outside themselves? The book was too wordy for me and came across as shlock much of the time. Still, it did have some good ideas and so I would say, make up your mind for yourself."
4,Why people succeed and why they fail with real life stories,This book is Filled with real-life stories about why people fail or succeed and 8 step path to change failure to success. This is also inspiration book story of Nuking the executive floor and the body in the living room as well as box of 424 different pairs of gloves are really nice and eye openers.
3,The Duh Factor,"A few worthy stories, but more on the line of the duh factor...for example, the story titled Q and A. The lesson from the experts is prepare for a meeting where you will announce change...duh."
4,Lead by example,This iks a book recommended by the boss to better coop people into helping with the change process. Change is hard and having as much knowledge to overcome resistance is always helpful.
5,Good Book for Work,I read this book to be a better manager at work and help my people through some changes. It really has some practical advice and is well written.
5,Bring on the Team Umizoomi merchadise!!!!!,"My two year old daughter can't get enough of Team Umizoomi. Is there a Millie, Geo or Bot doll anywhere? There's money making potential with this team so somebody bring on the toys, games, books. Christams is not too far away and it sure would be nice to have something under the tree. :-) Team Umizoomi, We need your help! :-)"
5,Love UMIZOOMI!!,"awesome DVD for the little ones in your family! Milli, Geo, and Bot are great additions to anyones home. They aid in teaching your youngsters to love math, colors, shapes, and patterns from a very early age. My two year old has been watching them for 18 months, and loves it!!!"
5,We want more Umi!,My 3 year old son and 16 month old daughter love love love this show. Its their favorite and they refuse to watch anything else. Its great because it so educational. Please give us more! We need this for our car!
5,loved it!,"My son loves it! he will sit in front of the tv and watch the whole thing without moving. then we have to stand up and crazy shake with geo, millie and bot."
5,Love,My son loves Umizoomi! I don't have much else to say except that if your kid likes umizoomi they will like the DVD.
1,worst ever!!!,"I've had Dr. Venkat as a professor for 3 classes at RIT and he is by far the worst I have ever had. DO NOT BUY HIS BOOK! It will only make you dumber! That is how I feel after coming out of his class. I believe the reviewer that says the website is a main resource, he points us to the class site all the time with no helpful information, and because he can't answer the questions himself on the spot. Are you buying a book or a website? I think that's all the helpful information I have for now."

5,Sid Farkas - Priority Management,"This is the single most influential group in the history of the Northern New Jersey mid-90's bar club scene, man! Pizza is addictive....the moment your done, your ready for another slice!"
2,"They Get An ""E"" for Effort...","The title of my review says it all. I bought this CD 2 days ago because I had heard a snippet of the song ""Baby If You're Ready."" I LOVED it. The vocalist, Latoya Williams, is great. She needs to do some work MINUS Doggy's Angels. Of the remaining 18 tracks, I only liked ""Curious"" and ""Pop Your Collar 2 Dis."" The whold hard-core thing just doesn't work here."
2,One step back...,"for Snoop Doggs new label. This album would sound better if the Doggys Angels were taken off every track, leaving just the numerous guest appearances. Snoop now almost sounds as wack as the doggys angels, who by the way were individually much better before they formed their group. Cognac was on the Escape from Death Row soundtrack on a track with Daz, where she sounded promising. Snoop doesnt seem to see how wack his flows are now as he almost singlehandedly ruins every track he is on with his flows (fa shiizzo, DPG 123, 213 blah blah)."
4,Album is bangin,"Ain't heard from dem in a while,but dis album is bangin.Every single track on dis cd is worth listing to...they got good skills"
1,Flash In The Pan album,You will wake up in a year and you won't even remember this album ever existed. That's how crappy this album is. Avoid it at all costs.
1,Don't waste your money,Do not waste your money on this vacuum. It is a royal pain to clean. The filter bunches up inside and you have to pull it down to clean it and then you have the dust and dirt all over your hands. The suction power is much too low and you are basically pushing the dirt around. It will pick up lightweight dust but no dirt or sand. It also holds very little before it needs to be cleaned.
4,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sonic's in a whole new world!! All new graphics,new and inproved characters,sweet powerups,and chaos can port!!!!!!!! This game is a have to buy!!!! And one more thing: TOTAL CHAOS!!!!!!!! PLEASE,BUY THIS GAME!! And have fun!!!"
4,One of my Favorite Games!!,"I have it for Dreamcast.....I wouldnot change it, I'd leave it the same.....but now, with GameGear Games(1995)on it? oh.... much better.....better graphics.....sound.........and longer gameplay, I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Educational to kids by adventures(But that is a dumb reason)Sonic is the best!!!!! ..."
1,One of the worst games ever,"I am definitely a sonic fan, but i have to say this is a horrible game. The controls are absolutely horrible, where the game kills you needlessly when it blows you around the stages. Also, it gets very repetitive and boring, it's basically the same stages over and over again with different people. I would advise not getting this. For young people, it would just not be fun and the same ole thing. For older people, you will just be dissappointed with the poor controls and handling."
2,Sonic in 3D is never going to work,"I had this game when it was first realeased on the Sega Dreamcast and at the time i was excited about the prospect of playing a 3D Sonic game. And then i played Sonic Adventure, oh and what a mess it was. You would think with the awsome power of the Gamecube Sega would have made some small attempt to improve all the awful bugs from the original Dreamcast version. Well they ait done a single thing, it's still a mess. The 3D camera is still as bad as it was on Dreamcast and all other bugs that annoyed me at the time are still in there. Everything about this game is just awful, the music, the terrible voice acting and lets no forget Big the Cat. Get Mario Sunshine or if you need Sonic that badly then get the Mega Collection instead avoid this rubbish."
3,Mirror Image,"When i first heard this game was called the ""director's cut"" I immediatally thought ""new levels, new missions, added features and probably an updated chao garden"" but no all i got was a re-released version of Sonic Adventure for the dreamcast. Yes it's exactly the same game, no new script, no new levels, no upgraded chao garden, just some unlockable Sonic game gear unlockables.Now i'll admit i like the added game gear games, its just that they really shouldnt put DX or directors cut on the game when it has the same graphics as the dc or the same lines as they had in the game. They really couldve changed the music too, it's mustly heavy metal rock bands from the 80's. Ok maybe im a little tough on it but what do you expect from a five year re-released game. Sega really shouldve spent more time on this one then maybe i wouldnt be rambling on and on about this sick excuse for a remake/directors cut game."
4,"Gee, talk about a double standard","I've noticed across the internet that people are complaining about the graphics on Sonic Adventure DX, saying they are only relatively improved. So tell me this, when The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time/Master Quest was released, why didn't anyone complain about those unimproved graphics?The gameplay is still great, but I will admit that the graphics lack in several areas, and the framerate is a little off. It does feature Progressive Scan and Dolby Pro Logic II sound, which is a plus. This is enjoyable for the biggest Sonic fans and completionists, and it does cost...less than any other new game."
5,sonic,ah man! this game is so cool and so much fun. just finished the gamecube version and ya gotta love it...especially super sonic!
5,This game doesn't deserve to be underrated,"This game is an improvement of the original Dreamcast game. Lots of things are fixed up, Graphics look much sharper & nicer,music is the same, they added new features like new unlockables such as Game Gear games (you have to collect a certain amount of emblems to unlock them) & a new mission mode with around 60 missions."
3,sonic adv.dir.cut,"the game is ok, kids love the chao garden, i believe on sonic adv.battle 2 there are more chao garden in there, so if you like chao garden maybe that's the one, but if you like sonic game the sonic adv.dir.cut is ok, the only problem you could only have sonic eggs, not other characters, so maybe next time sega/gamecube will create sonic chao garden only with many different character eggs, and different activities, bcs kids like it."
1,"An imported game, hmm....","Now, Sonic Adventure 2:Battle, I loved that game very very much since it has great storyline and that they fixed major stuff, even if it was imported I loved it. But this game.... They indeed imported it, but they did a very VERY sad job on it. I actually run through floors while I played through levels. The result? A big bugged game. I found a huuuge FAQ (frequently asked question) guide on all the bugs you can find in this game. Folks, it was the biggest bug guide I have ever seen. The people who've imported it on GC didn't even check, or even fix the glitches.Tis was a very sad moment, indeed. I sold it for money afterwards though... went to try another game to enlighten me from this dissapointment."
5,a fun game,I know alot of people diss this game but think of when it came out. It basically was the example for modern graphics in games. Sure it's pretty easy but i think it's great for it's time.
4,A bit of lagging and slowdown.,"I used to have this for the Dreamcast. So I knew this would be good. The only complaint I have is that the Gamecube version has a bit of slowdown and lagging, at least on my game. I don't know if its with all the games. Also in my game there were times when I happened to walk through a wall and died or I ran and went through a rail on a bridge. I don't think Sega ported the game over that well. I don't remember that happening in the Dreamcast version. The only graphical difference I noticed was the water. I think its different, maybe its just me. It's a pretty good game but the only complaint is that the game has lagging and slow downs while running in the game and that I fall and died when I happen to run into a wall or off a bridge. Then again like I said it may just be my game."
4,"Pretty interesting, but not as challenging as it's original","I remember with fondness playing Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast, and I found myself having a very difficult time. When the director's cut came out, I was excited. I hoped they would add a few things to the story. I was wrong. It was very fun playing the game again, but I felt it was too easy. Many of the levels I had trouble with on the Dreamcast version were so easy. Chao raising was still very fun, but I never got the hang of racing. Other than that I had a very good time playing it."
5,Hot,"This Game is hot, hot, hot. Any video game dork should ger this game for sure. Its a blast no dout about it. My favorit guy is big the cat for sure."
4,Sonic time is back,"when you start the game you only have Sonic to use in the gamelater you would start to find more people in the game tp usewhen you see Big in the game he well be unlocked in the gamethe people are:AmyKnucklesSonicE102'y'BigTailsanother cute thing is the choasyou get new gardens in a new stageyou get 2 eggs in each gardenso you would start out with 6 eggsthere are 3 hidden eggs a gold, a slver, and a black"
4,Sonic Kicks Butt,"I like Sonic. Normally I wouldn't buy him cause the games are to short. But when Nintendo sold those preview discs, I played it and it was kinda fun...."
5,Sonic dx to buy or not to buy?,"well first off i would like to say that the story is fully brilliant and fun at the same time, and easy to follow. but.. the voice overs are a bit lacking.. now i am a HUGE fan of sonic adventures and this was great. the graphics are good. the gameplay is ok... and the controls are really simple and overall entertaining. the main story is trying to stop a monster called chaos who the more he eats emeralds the more powerfull he is.now.. about CHAO. chao are creatures like tamagotchi.. if you think you will only buy this game for chao then buy sonic adventure 2 battle if you have it already then get this one. SADX is good for raising chao. they react to your actions for example throwing them against a wall :) but there is no chao kindergarden or doctor and you cant fight or learn karate. you can only race. both games feature the ability to transfer chaos to gameboy.. so if you have both it is great to teach in SA2B and learn and raise in SADX."
4,cool sonic bad graphics,When I got this game I LOVED it so much A few weeks later POOF! it starded to get A little boring but just this day Feb.4rth 2012 I just finished sonic's Adventure. so I have beenworking on it ever since it starded geting boring so that love came back!
5,Must-have Sonic game,"This is my favorite Sonic game and one of my favorite games of all time. I used to play the original version of this game on Dreamcast, and the Gamecube port of faithful in every way, and adds a lot of fun new content as well. If you like sonic games or adventure platformers in general, this is a must-have."
5,old school,I really enjoy casting with this reel. Very old school. It is built to last a lifetime if you maintain it. The drag is great and the bait clicker works well for catfishin'. You cant go wrong.
3,Great but Short-lived,"WW2 first-person shooters, bringing nostalgia, perhaps family history, as well as fantasy, have proven a rich genre for the software-jocks to make a good living.Flashback 2 decades, I played the orginal Wolfenstein for Apple II. More recenty the Return for W, a couple of Dooms, Half-Life and Unreal Tournaments for PCs. Also X-box (but a joke as too many disk cache errors to play after very short while- gave the X-box away!).Call of Duty took about 6 hours for a green-horn to complete to the end, with great team-play and cinematic experiences, scary moments, and really dumb AI for your squad and enemy. Needs about another 50 levels, and some medals (1942 overtones) to be value for money against latest Wolfenstein or the superb StarWars Knights of the Old Republic. Just because it's for Apple doesn't mean we should be desperate."
2,Subpar Doctor's kit.,"I got this for my 3 year old son. The toys are very ""cheap"". The syringe completely comes apart (it should be in one piece). The only thing I liked about this kit was the carrying case. Returned this and got the fisher price one for about a dollar more and much more high quality!"
4,Just what the Dr ordered,"Wonderful addition to our doctor kit. I still miss the one's that came out when I was a kid, but this is a nice set."
1,cheap toy,"This is a really cheap toy. It was broken within 5 minutes of my nephew playing with it. Also, it was on sale at Wal-Mart for $5 after x-mas. I paid $30 for it and returned it."
2,Lame game,"Was very underwhelmed by this game, quite annoying to play, with clumsy controls and functions. Tried to play a couple of times before I gave up."
1,Do not like it,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield is the worst of the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games.I am very disappointed.
1,Bad disc,Disc doesn't install program. I Googled the error message and discovered there are a lot of bad discs being sold out there.
3,Tom Clancy's Games-CD,"I bought it to pass my leisure time while travelling! amusing and action packed. I would recommend it if you like this type of ""single"" player action CD games."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this 6 months ago, just to have around for my daughter to get used to. She's not even using it yet, and already the flusher is broken. This was very disappointing for my little girl (as well as myself after forking out double the price of other toilets just for this feature)! Also, it is VERY large, and takes up quite a big section of the bathroom, so if your's is small, like mine - avoid this trainer."
2,Not for boys!!!,"I bought this potty a few years ago for my daughter, she was never really interested it in so I packed it away. When it came time recently to train my 2 year old son I couldn't find the splash guard. It was in my opinion a poor, flimsy piece that never really stays on. At any rate, I contacted Totco and within days I had a new one at no charge. (5 stars for their customer service!!!)Lo and behold though, it will not stay on the potty and hasn't done any good. I ended up buying the flip and flush seat that attaches right to the toilet, he prefers that over the little potty. Bottom line, my kids never liked the little trainer potties, so I'm just sticking to the regular toilet from here on out!"
1,Horrible for Boys!!,First off the pee gaurd comes out way to easily so my son has more fun taking it off and playing with it then peeing over the seat and onto the floor making a LOT of messes for me to clean up. Second when we can get the flushing handle to work the battery wears out very very quickly. Its a MAJOR hassle to change the battery and we finally gave up. Also the lid comes down and annoys my son. He hates it so I finally took it off! Its a neat concept but they should have built it alot more sturdy and just an overall better design.
2,Too wobbly!,"I gave it two stars because it looks like an adult toilet and makes flushing sounds..However, it is to wobbly if you want to use it on anything besides carpet."
2,good looking,"Bought for my second son when he was potty training. I loved how it looks like a regular toilet and amkes the flushing sound, but it is big and bulky. I put it in my bathroom to he would get used to ""going"" in the bathroom and it took up way to much floor space. Was a pain to clean since uring went under the collection bowl. Had way to many small parts that made it difficult to clean. We were never able to get it truely clean. Finally just bought a step stool and he used to ""big boy potty"". Maybe just a problem for the boys sine they are built differently."
4,PERFECT POTTY,I bought this for my 20-month old daughter just so she could get familiar with the potty concept and she immediately loved it and started using it sporadically. She loves to flush (it makes a cool flushing sound) and now that she's 2 yr. she helps remove it to flush in the big toilet and clean up. It's a great potty to get started with. It looks like the real thing but it's perfectly small like our kids! It helps them feel comfortable with the concept and makes them feel like a grown up to sit on a toilet that looks like the real thing. It's a good buy!
1,Too small for my son,"I recently purchased this product, my third potty, with high hopes based on previous reviews. I was completely disappointed to find out that it is WAY too small for my 33 month old son. I found out after I bought the potty that the manufacturer's recommended age is 12 to 30 months. I'm sending it back today. The construction quality is good but it's just a poor design to accomodate larger children. I called the manufacturer and they were nice enough but their only rely was that ""one size fits all"", which, in my case, it doesn't."
4,LOVED IT,I loved this toliet and so did by little girl. She really liked that it looked like mommy and daddy's. The flushing sound didn't work on ours but from what I read in some of the other reviews I am glad.(no noise is better than too much) The only draw back to it is it's size but we had plenty of room so that worked out for us.
2,"More ""Customer No Service!""","This item is a really good idea, the fact that its made in the U.S.A. is fantastic! It only has one flaw - the ""flusher unit"" (that others here have complained about) is made in China, ask me how I know....because upon installing the battery the unit flushed & flushed & wouldnt stop! We called the manufacturer only to find out the 800 # on their isntruction sheet is wrong, we then called the number from their website (long distance) & left a message, this was followed up by an e-mail, well here we are 4 days later & no returned call nor reply to the e-mail! I find this ridiculous. To make a long story short I debated about returning the whole unit but still like the concept so I took it apon myself to diagnose & repair the ""flusher unit"" - it turned out the switch had a bad solder joint that caused a short. The manufacturer should make this part here in the US as well or train the folks in China how to solder properly:-)"
2,Cute Idea But Distracting & Not For Boys,"We bought this yesterday and will be taking it back. I have a boy and the pee guard is very flexible. When he would sit on the potty the pee guard folded right down into the pot and is useless. Also the flush feature, although very cute, is a big distraction. He would rather stand up and flush than sit on the potty. This might be an ok potty for a girl but not a boy."
5,I LOVE THIS POTTY!!,"I recently purchased this potty for my son. He refused to accept the first one we bought. I believe the fact that it looks like a real toliet did the trick. He has been using it regulary since it arrived. It's quite amazing how his attitude has changed. We almost decided against buying the potty due to a July 30th review but thankfully bought it. I agree the deflector is quite flexible but if a child were to sit on a more firm one he could be injured. Also, the flusher could be an irritant if the child is not taught to use it only after going. Would you let your child play with the flusher on a real toliet?This trainer is a really great product."
2,I don't really care for it,"I bought this potty for my daughter in preperation for potty training. This potty has really done nothing spectacular to justify the forty dollar price tag. The little flushing mechanism broke on ours almost right away. The whole thing feels rather flimsy, and like a previous reviewer, the packaging was horrible. I thought that I may have received one that had been opened and returned. The one feature that I really loved however, was the wipe/toilet paper holder. That being said, my daughter actually prefers the little seat thing that goes on the actual toilet and a step stool. I was at first hesitent about trying that method as she is on the small side, but it has worked perfectly for us."
2,Disappointed!,"We read the reviews that this potty might not be the best for little boys, but I thought that the real life features like the flusher handle might be worth it anyway. My 15 month old son is big for his age, but he doesn't fit at all!! He couldn't even attempt to pee sitting down on this potty, the hole is just too small for his little butt. We were so disappointed because we could tell he was excited about his very own potty, but we are going to have to return it and get something else."
3,"Great idea, lid doesn't stay up","We got this potty for my 19 month daughter. I haven't really started potty training her yet, but she loves to sit on it and flush it. The only problem is that the lid doesn't stay up. When she sits down, it falls on her and makes her really mad. She has to get up and put the lid up, then sit down again, then the lid falls again. When I take it off, she gets mad because the lid is off and it isn't like the ""big"" potty."
2,NOT FOR BOYS!,"Our son's pertinent part points about two inches above the pee guard! He is tall/big for his two years, bit I don't see how the pee guard would be effective for any sized boy. Also, the guard detaches too easily from the potty which futher comprimises its effectiveness. The potty is really cute, easy to put together, and easy to clean, but I would only recommend it for girls."
3,Not For Boys !! Part 2,"I was shopping for a potty that was going to be overall effective for my son. When I fist saw this potty I thoght it was going to perfect since it looks like mommys and daddys potty. Its really cute and I like all the accesories, for example it makes a flusing noise, has a lid,a place to have toilet paper. Well my son loves it too! But when he pees it goes all over the place. The shield guard is not high enough. My son is not that tall so I know its not him. He has to sit really far back so it could aim right at the bowl. Every time he has to go potty I have to go with him to make sure he is sitting right."
3,Decent potty w/ some drawbacks,"Overall a decent potty, with a couple of problems. The lid falls down all the time, either hitting the child in the back while sitting or closing the lid while my son is standing and going potty, which makes for a big mess. Also, the removable seat doesn't work well on our toilet seat...the hard plastic doesn't stay in place and my son is frightened by the seat sliding around while he's sitting on it. It's pretty large too...not great if you have a small bathroom. I wouldn't buy this again, it just didn't work for us."
5,"Elegant food,from a wonderful women with a superb cause",Elegant food that is fresh. The illistrations are magnificent. THey show how the actual vegetables look. My favorite is the rooster. That page shows the experienced and the imagination of the artist.
1,Disappointing,"I received this book as a Christmas present (through Amazon)and have tried and tried to be friends with it, pulling it off the shelf , looking through it and then returning it to the shelf in favor of my other cookbooks. It is cold and self-congratulating throughout, and the ingredients are not appealing to me. My diet is healthful vegetarian, and this book contains a lot of meat and ingredients I can not find in my area. If anyone wants an unused copy, let me know!"
3,Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook,"I was beyond excited to receive this cookbook after my wife and I had the intense pleasure of dining at Chez Panisse for our anniversary. However, while it contains fascinating background information on both the history of the Cafe and its purveyors, its recipes seem unduly impressed with themselves and somewhat precious. The esoteric nature of many of the ingredients provokes a cumulative eye-rolling effect, and to tell the truth, some recipes (Spaghetti with Herb Meatballs) that you would expect to elevate the mundane end up tasting... well, mundane. Great for reading, so-so for cooking. I love you Alice Waters, but I think I'll stick to eating your food."
4,I Need a Better Grocery,"Alice Waters is an amazing chef who's tastes buds are on the mark. If only my grocery store had all of the ingredients she calls for. I've made several recipes from this book, some simply, some with more flair. All with great success. There are many I'd love to try but not until I can find the ingredients she calls for.It's also one of the few in my collection that is simply gorgeous just to look at."
2,Suckered twice,"Previously bought the Chez Panisse Cookbook, was disappointed and then bought this one thinking it might be an improvement. Something about the recipes in these books leaves me cold. Either the recipes are unappealing, or they require exotic ingredients that are difficult to find in this part of the country. Also, not a lot of content for the price. I would not buy this until I had browsed it in a regular bookstore. Two mistakes are enough."
5,longtime fan,"Eaton is one in a million among playing tunes of the 20's, 30's,40's, and early 50's. He plays every tune lovinglyin a straight forward way.To me that is giving the composer of the tune credit in knowing how his/her tune should be played Most jazz artists today play the first few notes as written--after which they take off into a world their oun leaving the listener hanging inthe air. Eaton also at the end of the disk gives a short talk about the composers of the tunes he has just played. that puts the icing on the cake."
3,Made in America by John Eaton,"This CD is a disappointment to me, I bought it on the strength of his marvellous playing on the CD by Wild Bill Davison titled ""Lady of the Evening"". If you like cocktail type piano playing, this is for you as in this respect it is very good. But if you like a swinging piano, save your money."
3,It was FREE,This 64 MB flash drive came free with Battlefield 2142. It's useful and it was FREE.I can't complain about that...
4,good filter for honda motorcycle,I saved a bundle buying this filter formy honda 1800 vtx and 1100T ACE.cost about 1/3 the price of honda filters.
4,Price too high,"These are good filters, but I can get them at my local auto parts supplier for $5.88 each. Amazon's $15 price for two is out of line."
1,Wrong color,"If you want the blue filter, you wont get it. I tried twice and got the wrong one. Apparantly the color was changed and Amazon doesnt know this. Its for a motorcycle and blue was important."
3,How do you know?,Is there any possibility this is a knock off? With a price so low seems too good to be true.
5,Different color filter? Don't Worry!,"I was perusing the reviews and came across one that gave this excellent filter only one star. All because it came in a different color other than the advertised blue. I have been using these filters for several years on several different make vehicles. They truly perform their job. The reason for the different color is that Purolator has improved their filter container and it is now in a textured matte yellow. The texture makes it easier to grab when oil has come in contact with the surface. So it is now actually, a more rugged looking, easier to handle filter at a great price. Thanks Amazon for another great product available through your site."
1,Just Records of the Amount on the Receipt - No Meat,"This is probably the worst biography I have ever read. Having recently toured Fairlane Estate in Dearborn, I was interested in learning more about the woman who was instrumental in designing and building such an interesting house and gardens. I learned NOTHING from ""Ford Bryan's"" (if that's his real name) book. Mr. ""Bryan"" took incredible pains to record the details of every sales receipt and house purchase made by the Ford Family but there was literally nothing substantial about the people he was supposed to be writing about. If it wasn't for the pictures, we would have no idea what Henry or Clara even looked like! As for their personalities? A neighbor or two was quoted from probably some old letters or interviews but the book presents a huge family of one-dimensional, cardboard characters from the past. I suspect that Clara Bryant Ford was a woman worthy of an incredible biography. Let's hope it comes along soon!"
5,"I love this game, even if I think this expansion doesn't add much","I can't lie. I don't think the Inns or Cathedrals add much to the game. I mean the add an element of risk for big gain, but they could have been including with the main game, they don't add a new dynamic to the game like my favorite expansion, Builders and Traders. However adding more game pieces and the larger piece are quite welcome and make this expansion a must have."
5,Very Fun!,"My wife and I really enjoy this expansion. We are one of those couples that are often so busy with kids and other life engagements that we don't get together with others often, so we play Carcassonne with only the both of us (not the best way to play!) but we really enjoy this expansion and keeps things interesting and adds extra strategies."
4,Good Game... Name correction,"This is one of a number of good expansions to Carcassone... A very good game for all ages. Can be played ultra competitively by gamers, or completely for fun by all ages... with the same level of satisfaction... this cannot be said of too many games.Name correction... this expansion set is titled: INNS & CATHEDRALS, (not caverns)Just wanted to help avoid confusion."
4,Good,"The expansion is pretty good. THe large followers and the builders being my favorite part of it, the double the road values not that exciting to me.... LIke most expansions, adds some new peices that change the ways things can fit together... But, if you are in it just for the 6th player.... I think you can buy extra meeples online... I want to say it was called meeplepeople.com... though you might have to buy more of them than you wish too."
4,Great Expansion,If you love Carcassonne then this is a great expansion pack. We have a large family (who loves board games) so we always wanted to play with more players. Now we can. Plus the one extra big Meepole counts as double for an added challenge. Happy gaming!
5,Must - Have Expansion,"This expansion is absolutely essential if you're playing Carcasonne. There are wooden pieces that allow you to take a second turn, that increase the values of farms, that allow 6 people to play (instead of 5), and that increase the value of cities. The tiles and pieces match seemlessly into the basic game."
5,Great addition!,The best part of the expansion pack are the extra city pieces with different ways of finishing the city off. The inns and cathedrals are really fun to play with and they add to the game without making it complicated.
5,A great addition to one of the best games ever designed,"OK, I admit it, I'm a Carcassonne addict. I'm not sure whether it's the feel of the cards, the delightful artwork or the utter joy in stealing the 60 point city your spouse has been building for the last 20 turns... Whatever it is, this expansion adds yet more twists to this great game (and makes roads actually worth the effort!). If you have Carcassonne, get this."
4,awesome game,"My family has recently gotten very into this game, so getting the extension kit adds to all the fun."
5,"Yummy, Spicy, Puree First",See title. This is a constant pantry item. Wash your hands when done pureeing (ouch).
3,"I had requested the FREEDOM song be on the C D I order but it was not. Thia CD is abit heavy for my taste, but I will keep it.","I had requested teh FREEDOM SONG be on the CD I ordered but it is not. The CD is OK, but a little heavy for me.I think he did a great job of The Freedom Song. Sorry I didn't get it."
2,Skip this collection in favor of.......,"I found the 3-CD box set ""Rock & Roll Legends,"" in which Darin has his own disc, to be better than this collection. Featuring LIVE versions of ""Splish Splash,"" ""Plain Jane,"" ""Dream Lover,"" and ""Mack The Knife,"" it also replaces the less-arresting ""Artificial Flowers"" with the ecstatic rapidness of ""I Wish I were In Love Again"" and ""Don't Rain On My Parade."" Also, it has the same ratio of mono to stereo tracks as this disc. The other two CDs in the box set include live performances by Jerry Lee Lewis & Gene Vicent. The only thing ""Ultimate Bobby Darin"" has going for it is the inclusion of the uber-classic, ""Beyond the Sea."""
2,Very Hard,"This game is frustrating, trying to find Barney in this game is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I think that Barney disapears on purpose just to make you mad. I spent over 3 hours trying to find the purple dinosaur and all of his little friends. Barneys friends don't give you any help at all, all they do is just watch you as you sit there like a bump in a log trying to find them. Then Barney screams at you in some kind of weird language asking if you fell asleep looking for him. After I finally passed the 1st level, Barney's eyes turned red and he ran into a wall. After all of that I was so hungry so I ate the game. Thats my experince."
4,Stylish & Simple Mosaic,"I have been interested in doing mosaic projects but did not know anything about how to get started. This book is very understandable, it tells exactly what tools are needed for each project. It also has a variety patterns to follow outside of the pictures. I highly recommend this book for the beginner or the experienced. There are a lot of great ideas!"
4,Visual Series - Teach Yourself Internet & World Wide Web,"This is an extremely helpful book for anyone that is just starting working on the computer and internet as well as an experienced person.I have found the book helpful in teaching the internet to others. Many times we forget to inform the new learner of the information that is so basic to us.This book takes them through a complete process. They build thought upon thought. For people who are visual learners, the pictures on the pages are very refreshing to see that one is actually getting the right results from following the written instructions.I have been working with the internet for years and still refer people back to the Visual Series as the best value for their money."
4,Excellent book for end user,"This book is an excellent overview for the end user. This book explains the general concepts of Internet and World Wide Web and yet the area they cover was very broad but not in depth. If you are confused with all general concepts but do not have interest to go very deep into the topics, this is definitely the book for you. Good visual presentation always great for understanding the subject. I have been using this book when explaining the Internet to non-I.T people, they love it."
5,Exactly as ordered,"Great book, good delivery time. Just what my daughter needed for her voice lessons and got it right on time to start working on her recital song."
4,"works great, stores difficult",This works just as advertized. It'w a little difficult to store since it's so flexable and does stack with the other pans easily.
5,This book is great!,"I am also a first year nursing student and the first fundamentals book we used was so useless and hard to read I hated doing my homework. However, this book is so easy to understand and use, especially with the study guide which is also wonderful. I would not trade using any other book for this one. Trust me, you'll really understand what is being talked about."
2,Annoying book,"As a nursing student, this book is used quite heavily by the faculty. The book's infinite charts, tables, and figures are enough to drive you nuts. There are very few good photos. Our nursing teachers were regularly having to use other books to show us photographs of whatever we were studying. Also, after reading the material, I always felt like I didn't really know the material. If I really wanted to know the material well, I had to go study it in an Anatomy & Physiology book.I have looked at other Med/Surg books and prefer them, any of them, to this one.This book is more suited for the experienced nurse rather than the nursing student."
4,Good Music,"The songs in this CD are catchy and children love them. Having the songs in both languages is helpful. I play this tape in a children's tape player with a microphone. My children and their friends will sing along with the tape especially to the ""Hello"" song. Children will enjoy and be encouraged by hearing the recordings of other children singing on the tape. My only criticism is the pronunciation. Since Spanish is my first language, I am very sensitive to correct pronunciation. The English accent is prevalent through out the tape. Nonetheless, the songs are wonderful and I use the tape frequently. I just sing louder so the children can hear correct pronunciation. I am often praised on my children's Spanish and this tape is one of my tools."
4,A great start......,"This product is exactly what it states it is - ""essential vocabulary and phrases in the subjects of First Words and Food"".There are 18 languages covered on 2 CD-ROM's - for 10 bucks!I read the 1st review and felt I had to respond. You get what you pay for & in my opinion, this is a great deal. The company that publishes this title produce full version programs of each of these languages - and more. If a more in-depth learning experience is what you're after, then spend a little more & buy the more complete version. I'm sorry, but for someone to complain about spending 10 bucks on 2 CD-ROM's - and feel the need to write about it is somewhat confusing to me. I just spent that much on lunch for crying out loud."
4,Educational Treatment of Lean and His Films,"Brownlow's massive biography does a very good job of painting a comprehensive picture of the great Lean--arrogant, demanding, selfish, and absolutely brilliant first as an editor and then as a director. Lean had no patience for what did not forward the story, and his movies were the better for it. One gets the impression, however, that the same was true for individuals in his life who did not help him achieve his own goals.A bit clunky at times in regards to readability, this is still a first rate book. The sections on Brief Encounter, the Dickens' films of the 40s, and Lawrence are excellent."
1,Belkin Surge Protector catches fire.,"Like many other reviewers, I had a power outage, and upon powering up, I smelled smoke, and it was coming from one of two Belkin Surge Protectors. Sparks and flames were coming from one unit, which was warped and very hot, with a hole in the bottom. The other unit was very hot to touch, and became inoperable afterwards."
1,Belkin Surgemaster burnt,"Had this unit and I cannot say if it was reacting to a surge or not, but it blew the breaker on the ciruit and the rear of the unit is burnt. None of the other surge protectors or breakers went off in the house. No damage to the wall or any equipment, but this surge protector was in an outlet with a metal cover plate - which is what I think saved the house from a fire. There were a few things plugged into it, but none of them were on besides two alarm clocks as we were out of the house. I do not recommend this item."
3,Poor Instillation,"When installed with the outlet cover plate removed and screwed into existing outlet, it does not cover the existing outlet box. You can see the top of the existing outlet and the hole above the outlet and into the box. Most 6 hole outlet extendes are centered on the existing outlet. This one is not."
4,Want to keep in shape during pregnancy?,"For those mothers-to-be who wish to keep in shape during pregnancy, Denise Austin will motivate you. This informative book presented with Denise's friendly enthusiasm is an excellent companion to her Pregnancy Plus Workout videotape. In Denise Austin's Ultimate Pregnancy Book, Denise presents exercises suited to each trimester of pregnancy, sample menu plans, recipes interspersed with pregnancy Q & A. She also includes a Shape Up After Baby chapter. I've sampled some of her recipes and am currently following her exercises. Whether or not you are a Denise Austin fan, you will find this book helpful and perhaps you too will find her enthusiam contagious."
2,"Somewhat dated info, not for those who already exercise","This book has two good points: it's written in Denise's usual friendly and motivating tone, which will be encouraging to the mom-to-be; and it contains several good recipes.However, the actual content of the book is not impressive:- the nutritional info is somewhat dated, with its recommendation to follow a low-fat, high-carb diet, no mention of DHA supplements, and no reccomendation to decrease carb intake if starting the pregnancy overweight.- the exercise routines might be ok for someone who has never exercised before, but for anyone who has, they won't help.I put this book aside and instead used ""What to eat when you are expecting"" as my nutritional guide and Lisa Hart's ""Fit Mama"" as my workout, as well as plenty of walking and some hiking, and I'm glad I did!"
1,Faulty,"Purchased the Artcessories Phantom II for a specific microphone used several times a year. It worked on DC 5 or 6 times over a period of 8 months and then failed. After battery replacement, it still did not work."
5,Full range of moods,"Chanier's wide range of moods make for a vivid listening experience. His original compositions are very strong, with memorable lines and intricate variations, and journey from dark and quirky ruminations to light and cheerful tunes that make you want to whistle along. He's very much a jazz purist, and this CD captures the feel of an inspired live performance, with intense back-and-forth exchanges between Chanier and his skillful sidemen."
2,Mini-mini,The item was much smaller than I expected. I expected mini loaf pans that were 1/3 the size of a standard loaf. These were much smaller - almost 1/3 of a standard mini loaf.
1,This toy is defective- don't buy.,"I bought this plane for my nephew for Christmas. What a waste. I had the same problem as the previous review- the plane apparently has a design flaw and no quality control, in that the rear tail is misshapen and the left fan is not glued on properly. Impossible to fix and by the time you get the darn thing out the box is completely destroyed and not a good candidate for return. These people are apparently selling a toy that has consistent defect in the rear left tail, making it unusable. It comes with a backup main wing but not tail. Still, it ALMOST flew, even with the defect, so better luck in that department. No problem charging or getting the motor powered up."
1,Not worth the pages it's printed on!,"I am surprised at the good reviews for this ""book"" (if you can call it that). And why is the last reviewer listed as a ""veteran teacher"" reviewing a substitute handbook? Hmmm. Anyway, I wanted to warn other subs to avoid this book. It is simple material that will either be covered in your sub orientation or is just common sense. Save your money."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. It is very short and doesn't provide much information. The information that is covered is so simple I am surprised it was even published. Ex: ""when you come in the teacher's classroom the lesson plans should be on her desk or in close proximity"". I did not find this book to be any help at all."
4,Right to the Point,"I found this book to be easy reading, right to the point in what you need to know in managing one's classroom. It's a very informative tool in teaching basic skills one needs to know about substitute teaching. I would recommend it to anyone starting out as a teacher to prepare them for this field."
2,Boring!,"This book was not what I was expecting. I guess I was in the mood for a tell-all book, and Ms. Gibson didn't deliver. It was a short read."
5,Blows Smoke Rings Around You,"Thank You For Smoking is a sly irreverent film that takes shots at the tobacco industry - both above and below the belt. Most of the time with straight faces.Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a lobbyist for the stuff that causes lung cancer. Like Satan in the flesh, he can sell ice to Eskimos and make black seem whiter than white. Nick even manages to win over a cancer patient in a talk show and I enjoy his unorthodox reasoning skills - he tells his son Joey (Cameron Bright) about ""flexible morals"". All goes well for this spin doc till he meets a young reporter (Katie Holmes) who serves his bedroom secrets for public consumption. Parroting Naylor, she says she's doing it for the mortgage. You'll have to watch to see how he bounces back.Intelligent and funny, Thank You For Smoking will blow smoke rings around you with its satirical references. I was totally tickled pink at the irony of it all. A must have in your video library!"
3,It could have been better!!,"The items were bright and colorful- my daughter enjoys playing with the pieces. I was disappointed to find that all the items pictured were not actually in the package I received. I did not get the cookies, corn-on-the-cob or ice cream. I did get 2 sodas and a bottle of mustard. I would not have been disappointed if they would have indicated that all baskets may not contain the same items."
4,Elegant... but I'm doubting on the quality,"This are a nice pair of boots. Simple yet elegant. My main concern is that some of the shoes of the brand are now made in china, not in Romania as usual. It looks good though, but the interior lining doesn't seem to be leather. I bought them at US$59 in an amazons offer, so I guess its ok.Sizing ..BEWARE! Its just crazy. I wear 8.5M US and had to go down a full size, and still have almost an inch left on toe area! but i guess its just the style. I do have narrow feet, and found that between a 7.5 and a sz 8 the diference lies only at the instep fit, they are just as long, only one is slightly more narrow(7.5), which works great for me. I've had this experience with other kenneth cole boots as well -westward, rock n ride and others-.Overall...wouldn't recomend if you are to pay more than 150 bucks. There are better options out there. Still it's a must as a dress shoe. Very nice one... Just elegant"
4,This CD is not so bad,"Ok, I must admit that I do like some of the songs on here. My favorite songs on here are ""Don't Think I'm Not"" by Kandi and ""Give Me Just One Night"" by 98 degrees. But I also like the song by Aaron Carter and the Backstreet Boys. But I wonder why they put ""Its Gonna be Me"" on here. Its such an old song and it should've been put on NOW 4 (see my review for NOW 6 about another song by N'Sync). But I also like most of the other songs on here like Jumpin' Jumpin' and i must say that I absolutely love Destiny's Child. They are my favorite girl band ever since they came out with their album with their song ""Survivor"" on it. So if you have most of the cd's in the NOW collection, then you should go out and buy this one but you might want to skip the first one by N'Sync."
2,Why was the Now! series made?,"If you really hate CDs and like the songs released better, this is for you. If you want a coaster collection for fun, this is for you. If you wanna hear raraties, this is NOT for you. It's only songs that get played 24/7/365. I can't believe this collection! Starting off good, then downhill. Now! 6 was better but that's not saying much. If listening to fake overplayed music is music, then I guess it is. Whoever made this should be punished.I've listened to some pop before. And still do sometimes. I like BSB, Evan and Jaron, LiT, Eve6, Jay-Z, et. al. But not Britney, Nine Days, and N Sync. Those are the worst picks on a compilation CD. AVOID.If you want a good compilation, try the Short Music For Short People. Even Totally Hits was better."
5,"Could be better, but DEFINETLY could be worse.","This collection of popular songs from 2000 was well thought out for the most part. They had a wide selection of music, but there were too many rap-like songs. If there were a few DMB and Matchbox 20 songs, and took away songs such as ""Shake it Fast"" and ""Case of the ex"" this would be a truly marvelous and flawless collection. I highly recommend it. It has a wonderful song at the end called ""It's My Life"" perfect for a motivated teenager, or adult."
2,"If you like pop, you basically own this","How is this for so much if there's no rare tracks? I don't get it. Most of these songs are overplayed anyways. the first three were cool, but not this one."
1,Punishment for anyone with taste,"Its really convenient; all the lame, teeny-bopper garbage that has been polluting the airwaves recently on one CD. Now you can listen to this and get a real good idea of how bad popular music can get. Even brain damaged chipmunks would find this mess reprehensible!"
5,Great!!!,"This is a great cd! It's got lots of songs and great variety ranging from sexy rap hits like Mystikal's ""Shake it Fast"" to ballads and slow songs like Mandy Moore's ""I Wanna Be With You"". Though the radio and MTV has played the crap out of some songs like ""Kryptonite"" and ""Case of The Ex"" as well as ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" but, I happen to like all of those songs, so I listen to them. This is a great cd with great songs and a lot of variety."
4,A Pop Fan,"When I was searching around for a good cd, my eyes struck THIS cd. I had recently been watching tv, and saw this commercial, and KNEW I had to get it. Never in 1 million years could I have found a better cd to get for Christmas. If I were you, I would get it, right NOW!"
1,OLD!!!,The worst Now I have and I would sell it for a totally hits!!! *NSYNC is long gone and also is Destiny's Child. People are probably listening to the better Now 14 or Now 55.
4,Variety is the key,"This CD is awesome! The songs are different [well, most, except for all the teen pop ones, but they're ok too :)], and it sounds like you're just listening to the radio. I especially love ""Wonderful"" by Everclear (a totally rockin' tune), ""I Wanna Be With You"" by Mandy Moore (breathy, great for nighttime), ""Case of the Ex"" by Mya (great beat, Mya's awesome voice), and pretty much every other song on the album. It's hard not to like this CD. You'll be addicted to it, because you never get bored of it. The best way to listen to it: Random. That way, you don't have to listen to all the teen pop songs in a row (why do they do that?) or all the rock songs in a row (at the END of the album :( Everyone likes this album, so if you don't know what to get for a pre-teen, kid, teen or even an adult who listens to Top 40, this CD is the ultimate pick."
5,2 Words: IT RULES!,Outstanding CD here. Yup! It is good. None of these artists sold out...this stuff should be on the radio more.
3,"ok, i guess","this is a pretty good mix, i have to admit, i mean, i like most of the songs on it. not all of them though, and the ones i do like, i already own!! i mean, what's the point? i suppose if you haven't bought any of the songs you liked then this is great. but if you like a song, don't you just go out and buy it instead of saying ""oh, *maybe* they'll have it on so-and-so compelation cd?"" it's just weird. oh well, if you like the songs on the cd, and you haven't already got them, then i reccomend this. but otherwise, it's a waste."
4,This is a great CD,"The CD rocks! I really like it. Almost all the songs are good, but there are some really horrible ones. Aaron Carter stinks! I'm sorry all you Aaron fans, but he can't sing and can't find a good topic to sing about. Mystikal is boring and too rap-ish for this POp CD. THe best song to me is Back Here by BBMak. They can actually sing very well and have a good catchy tune."
2,Now That's What I Call Music 5,I was very disappointed with this CD. I think it's a great CD if you are 12 years old! The majority of this CD is teeny bopper stuff. There were not enough artists on this CD who were over the age of 18. There is no variety on this CD...all the songs sound the same to me. The only redeeming quality of this CD are the last 3 songs...they are really good.
3,"You might not want to ""Shake It ( your money) Fast""","All of these songs are on the radio and most over played. But the good side of this CD is that you will be able to listen to it in a few months when new and fresh songs have come out and enjoy the ""oldies"". :0) If you're looking for a pop CD go get the *Nsync cd or some else were you don't know all of the songs. Overall save your money and go buy another CD."
3,You'll get sick of it easily...,"Most of the songs that are on here have been overplayed already. Or maybe because most of the songs on NOW 5 I have on the artist's full length CD's. The one problem with the NOW cds is that they put the songs on too late, some of the songs on here are almost a year (or more) old. But some of my faves on here are ""Lucky"" and ""I Wanna Be With You"", and ""Its Gonna Be Me"". I still think NOW 2 is the best one (even though I never bought it, 2 of my friends own it)."
1,Pointless Waste of Time (cont.),"Just like every other pop album, this was made simply to make money. The songs are boring and painful to listen to, and there's nothing new- everything on it has been played to death on the radio so that they can package it up in some nice little plastic case and sell it.Anyway, I'm sick of hearing people say this is music. It's not- it's the most lame, terrible stuff that pop brings us these days.I'm not wasting my money on this. Are you?"
2,I WOULD have loved it-three months ago!,"The idea of putting out a mix of music by great artists is of course a good one. However, this CD faces the same problem as many of the other NOW collections. By the time the CD is available in the stores, many of the ""hip"" songs are extremely overplayed. Either I own them on their original CD's, or I am so sick of them I can't handle hearing them one more time! This may not apply to everyone, but I've had this problem every time I've bought a NOW CD, even when I've done it right when they come out. This isn't a problem that can easily be solved, because obviously it takes a while to put a CD like this together, but before you buy this CD because it has has popular music, I would recommend looking at the list of songs and asking yourself how many you already have on other CD's and how many of the other ones you still WANT on CD!"
1,Just looking at the song list makes me queasy,"Sure, we've all heard these songs on the radio about 1 zillion times. But now -- a compilation of all of those overplayed songs together on one disk? Ugh. The problem with these ""Now"" cd's is that they come out too late - all the songs have already reached that ""overplayed"" state where when you hear them you want to lunge toward the radio and throw it at the wall. I mean I guess if you are TEN then maybe you can hear those songs over and over and not begin to HATE them. However, I myself do not have that ability. Therefore, I must say that if I ever receive this CD as a gift, it will be used as a coaster."
3,great cd....but it is missing a couple of major songs,"The CD has major hits from 2000 like ""Lucky"",""Doesn't Really Matter"",""Ex-girlfriend"",etc. However, there are a couple of missing songs on it. Did the compilers deliberately forget ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah and ""Higher"" by Creed. They could have put ""Arms Wide Open"" by Creed in there also."
4,Pretty Good,"I own Now vols. 2-5, and 5 is really, really good. (vol. 1 is horrible!) If you loved pop radio in the year 2000, you'll love this cd. Not only are all the big names on here, except I'd kick the BSB's off 'cause ""Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely"" borders oncatatonic, but they are immensely fun to listen to. The cd kicks off with 'N sync, and doens't stop, with the previously noted BSB flop/mistake, until Bon Jovi reminds you that ""It's Your LIfe."" It's fun to listen to. it's fun todrive to. It's just pure, all-out fun, and there's nothing wrong with that!"
1,Now 5=Negative Ominous Waves 5,"Now 5 and allthe nows stink.Only a few songs are good thru out the Now series,but only a few.if you like pop music which I don't.Ilike the Kriptonyte song[I know I spelled it wrong]I am a metal\rapcore personlike P.o.d"
3,Now 5,"This Cd is O.K. There are some good songs, but unfortunately there are also some lame ones. This music was popular for a while, but is pretty much getting old. The songs I like are: Bon Jovi's It's My Life, Aaron Carter's Aaron's Party, and Janet Jackson's Doesn't Really Matter."
2,So little Urbie on the album... Bring Back the Classics!,"I must agree with the previous reviewer... Urbie's signature lyricism is absent, here... the arrangements are too strained, too tense, and Urbie is all too missing from many of the tracks, doing the initial tune, and then handing things over to his band, who are not up to the challenge. Bring back Persuasive Trombone people! Get Urbie's classics on cd, and I'll buy the lot of 'em"
3,nice but doesn't stay non-iron,"This is a very nice shirt. It's well proportioned, is composed of good quality material, and the styling is nice. After multiple washes it does NOT remain non-iron. It absolutely will have to be ironed. And even then it's impossible to get all the creases out and make it look flat. Yes, it's non-iron but not indefinitely. If you buy this shirt do so if you are willing to end up ironing it every time or having it professionally cleaned."
4,great reference,Gives great information about back care and step by step program for doing yoga with back problems. Especially like the forms for assessing flexibility etc and goals list. I want to give a copy to everyone I know with serious back issues! I am a yoga instructor and will be using this as a go to guide for working one on one with students with back problems.
4,Very Well Written & Helpful Book; Needs Accompanying DVD,"Dr. Schatz has written an excellent book on back care, integrating a physician and Yoga teacher's viewpoint. Back physiology and mechanics are well explained and illustrated.Explaining Yoga postures by text/book is hard and one really needs a teacher in person. Short of that video is helpful. Therefore, I wish Dr. Shaatz would either update the book with DVD/Videos or upload the videos on the Internet on sites like YouTube etc. to make her Yoga for Back Care more practical and useful.Anybody with chronic back pain/problems will benefit from this book and gain understanding of the back pain; and get therepeutic benefit if they do the Yoga."
2,terry,I have taken yoga classes for years and it is nice to see the medical doctor values such a art to help back pain suffers.This book is okay for someone new to yoga and has back pain but it is over 10 years old. needs to be updated. I recommend other up to date books on the market today that shows the reader all forms of exercies to use to over come back pain.
5,Essential book for back health,"I have been giving this book as a gift since I became aware, through practice, of its body wisdom. I have severe back problems (scoliosis)and physicians are amazed that I am not in a wheelchair. This book, together with ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" have been essential educational tools in body awareness and ways to help myself."
5,Back Care Basics review,This is excellent with in depth medical information and a do-able and effective exercise plan.In just one day I already feel very hopeful and have begun some poses and can feel the difference. This is the book I have been wishing for. Now it is just left up to me to apply this great program.I am very satisfied with the book!
3,"Not bad, but a let down for anyone with prior yoga experience","The best part of this book is the section on evaluating your own back problems. I learned quite a bit about my own back pain, posture, etc.. I did have a bit of a problem with the section on scoliosis where you have to have a partner help you - if you don't have a partner, you're apparently out of luck. I was also a bit disappointed with the fact that this book assumes no prior experience with yoga. I have practiced yoga at the intermediate level for about 2 years, and was hoping to find a resource that would advise me on what poses would be specifically helpful for my back problems, and perhaps which poses to avoid. For someone at my level, this book is a bit *too* gentle."
2,sherri back and neck pain suffer,"I am a big fan of yoga , but this book had very little to offer in new subject matter for those who have taken any type of yoga classes- knos that the instructors always remind us not to do certain positions that may and most likly cause further pain to our necks or backs. I think if you are a beginer then this is a good start but better to try out a class where a teacher can tell you what you are doing wrong."
1,This could be a good book again... with a little updating.,"I read this book and while I know the positive effects of yoga, there has been much advancement in the way of back care in the past 10+years since this book was written. I would like to take a chance to tell you about and recommend a book that I thought was current, fun to read and clearly more effective in back pain treatment. The author has a Chinese and Japanese edition of the same book, and you know that if it works for people in the Far East, it will surely work for us Westerners.Your Plan for Natural Scoliosis Prevention and Treatment: Health In Your Hands (Second Edition)"
2,reader,very basic introduction to yoga and it's benifits it offers to some people. I tried a class with my girl friends and perk my interest but i was unbale to get into these positions the author suggested without some discomfort may work for others.
5,"Fun game, even better if I were a girl","I got this game as a Christmas present. I am not a big FF fan because they usually take too long and it's a little reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons, which I was never a big fan of anyways. When I read the instruction manual I realized that this game would be better marketed for the female audience. Throughout the game you acquire special abilities only by changing dresses, with each dress change is this huge dramatic sequence like they're getting a makeover done on the Rikki Lake show. It is a fun game all in all but I think that this the closest thing you'll get to Barbi meets Dungeons and Dragons."
1,Terrible,"God Awful. The Game came with no cover, scratches all over it, and 2 days late. It is unreadable and there is no chance of recovery. just over all a terrible choice to buy it from here."
2,Well they tried but failed...FFx-2 is a backwater rpg,"I played FFX twice and enjoyed every hour of game play. Yes the movie scenes were drawn out and the seldom placed saves spheres were annoying, but over all I loved the game. A very good plot.I was so excited to get X-2, as I started to play it, I became very disappointed. The game is more like playing a Britney Spears or the like genre game. I miss the other characters there was a balance of seriousness and goofy nonsense with a satisying plot. Here in X2 you use dress spheres?!? This is a game my daughter will play and I may have to bribe her on that since she wants to see Tidus again.FFX2 is a big let down. Only thing I can say is that the graphics are great and I can now skip the movie scenes if I wanted to. I hate the fast pace battles I should have the option to choose when to act like FFX instead of being force to react too quickly. Other than that no major improvement worth noting."
1,Nothing like Final Fantasy X,"This game was a HUGE disappointment. I loved FFX, but I couldn't stomach 30 minutes of this ""sequel"". They've turned Yuna into a pop-star, the characters get new abilities by changing dresses, and the battle system is ""real-time"" -- which I might have given more of a chance if it wasn't for the very disturbing dress-changing sequences and annoying character commentary.The game is 'girly' -- in the absolute worst, stereotypical, pink frilly dress kind of way. I'm disgusted to think that this is what is being marketed to young girls and that Square felt the need to replace Yuna's sweet serenity and maturity with this half-dressed pop-tart image.In my opinion, this game should not be considered a sequel to FFX. Between the changes in gameplay (I liked the CTB system!) and the new girly theme, this is just too different and FFX fans would probably be much happier replaying the original than taking a chance on this game."
1,Not a good sequel for FFX...,"I wouldn't say this is a good sequel for Final Fantasy X. X-2 does not have a plot, just Yuna and her friends trying to find her long lost love Tidus, which does not make it a real plot. And don't even get me started on Yuna in X-2! I mean, what did they do to her character?! What happened to the serious, devoted Summoner in Final Fantasy X? Now we just have a girl who's a singing pop star! Okay, I like how she's looking for Tidus and all, but not her new wardrobe and personality. And what's the deal with the short shorts? It's like she threw away her staff and purple dress. I also did not like her appearance, she looked so much better in FFX. Her face was like, much more... pure?She's just so... open and direct. Probably from Rikku's influence.I liked FFX, but NOT X-2."
2,This game is okay,X-2 is nowhere near as good as ffx. They changed many things that were already fine. Blitzball is ruined Blitzball fans.The battle system is better it makes fights go quicker. The storyline is not as good as ten. Overall this game is so so
2,okay,"Well i am a big RPG fan, ranging from the original FF's to Morrowind and FFX so i belive i know what i am talking about. There is one thing that makes this game great, The graphics and animation, thats it. I have noticed that some others here have mentioned that this game is too light hearted. I myself prefer the dark secreative the world is gonna end sorta game then some happy go lucky kingdom hearts stuff which i show FFX-2 is like.There is one other thing that is pretty good. The battle system, how it is real time again like back in FFV and FFVI so u have to be quick on what you were doing or the enemy would attack before you would. I read one post about someone complaing about that. Go play some of the older FF's that u can get on PS1 for 5dollars there by far better then this, they have a GOOD storyline, and have the same/better battle system"
3,Both better and worse than Final Fantasy 10,"Worse: The story. It's not as good as FF 6 7 or 10. It's not even as good as FF 9!Better: The game. The battle engine is IMHO the best battle engine ever made for Final Fantasy. It uses a turn-based, active-time system that is extremely fast-paced and makes the adrenaline pump! For the first time, you'll actually enjoy random battling. (Best section: the 100-floor basement...tons and tons of fun battles.) ;-)Also better is the non-linear play. The game is divided into 5 acts/chapters, but inside each act you get ~10 missions. These missions can be executed in whatever order you please, so you actually get to EXPLORE the world (gee what a novel idea!). You also have the joy of playing with the dress spheres with odd jobs like animal trainer, dark knight, and singer and experimenting with different fighting styles/looks.Overall, I recommend you buy it. You may not enjoy the story, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. :-D"
1,Rent it first!,I've played all of the Final Fantasy games and this one was the worst. The girls are annoying and after an hour I quit playing. Luckily I rented it from the video store so I'm only out $5.99. I'd recommed renting it first and if it suits your tastes...then possibly purchasing it.
2,Could we get strong female roles without them being half naked?,"Although I have always like the job concept of the older final fantasy series I have a hard time stomaching the mindless slutty characters of FF X-2. Hopping around barely dressed acting like grade school cheerleaders does not appeal to anyone but teenagers. It would be nice to see a female character in clothing that covers more than the essentials, who is strong willed, uses her brain and can kick [...]! Possibly a Mulan type character without the dressing up like a man to fit in. That battle system is fine I do like that you can change jobs in the middle of a battle. So I give this game 2 stars because the concepts is right it is just the characters, clothing and personality that is wrong. Square should be ashamed of themselves for portraying women like this in an already self obsorbed egotistical world.Shame on you Square."
4,Final Fantasy X-2,"Overall, the story line is pretty good. The graphics are excellent and the psuedo active battle with a job system like in Final Fantasy Tactics makes for fast paced battles and interesting strategies. However, if you're looking for the same characters as in FFX, you might be a little disappointed. Even Yuna is fundamentally different, more like a valley girl than the summoner intent on saving the world. This may be attributed to character development but I like to think of it more as the game designers trying to aim for a different audience than what FF games usually go for."
2,do you really like this,"If you forgot everything you ever knew about final fantasy X and this came out, you would think it was so stupid. The plot, trying to find a guy. Who would want to play that. The cutscene graphics are very good. almost real. But the gameplay graphics are about the same as final fantasy X that came out 2 years ago. The powering up system is horrible and doing special movies you have to change cloths. It is very confusing and not worth getting into. The voices are good. The game takes 30 hours to beat. The battling is not at all stragetic because you have a certain amount of time before an enemy attacks. You just say attack everytime. Yuna's song is awful."
1,dumb,i hate this game its soooooo stupid. yuna is a pop singer! i mean what a loser! tidus is not even in this game. the story is wack. the gameplay is too. yuna is worse than britney spears at singin. i would rather play a football game than dis. so dont buy it. pleez dont. square enix is trazh!
2,Just like a victoria's secret catalog,"Just a warning to parents out there looking at this game for their teenage sons...The game is based around the characters changing outfits to use different skill sets, and these outfits are less than appropriate. You may as well hand your kid a Victoria's Secret catalogue."
2,Gayness,"If you are over the age of 15 (male or female) do not waste your time with this game. It is even more cheesy and immature than FFX. I gave it 2 stars because the graphics are incredible; however, this game is a disgrace to the FF series."
1,lol,"it sucked, seriosuly. i look back on it and just laugh. i mean, seriously. i have to admit that i never liked Yuna. in ffx( which i still haven't finished XD), she came off as a wuss to me. but i had SOME respect for her. in ffx-2, she came off as a scandily dressed, gun-loving, still wussy...sap. how do you go from quiet, nice summoner to singing sensation. (though i didn't really like her song anyway).the fighting was different. instead of just siting there waiting for you to make a move, it's active gameplay. whoch isn't bad, just different.i stopped playing after a while because i just found the plot to be incredibly weak and kind of unrelated to ffx (at least, from what i'd played so far). everyone's outfit, 'cept the guys, are kind of slutty. LeBlanc, or w/e, is the worst. some of the game was just stupid, like giving LeBlanc a massage...if you're expecting a good sequel to a great game, you're out of luck."
4,worth it?,"when I finished this game, I was a bit confused about how something so unusual is normal to the characters. Anyway, excellent graphics, they brought back the old voice actors--even Tidus. one main difference is that the game flow is mission-based more than anything else. So it could get a bit choppy at times, and motivate you less to find out what happens next. Overall it's fun if you like doing missions and extra games and stuff. the percentage completion and six endings based on your completion threw me off though. if you get 100% completion (believe me, you need a walkthrough to do that) Yuna gets to...well, remember the ending scene of FFX? after the credits? Let's say Square enix knew they would be making a sequel when they finished FFX with that."
4,go on laugh but u better satch out,"i think that this is a great game. u have got to be kidding if u hate it. Even though there are only 3 girls in the game u can still be w=very of the stratigy.For all u old FF loving fans don't disreagard this game,but it still dosn't live up to FF7 good Cloud was cool. Buy it'buy it buy it or else."
2,Algo decepcionado...,"estoy algo decepcionado del juego, cambia ""todo"" o casi todo las reglas del FFX, nisiquiera sale un instante el novio de Yuna, las chika comienzan con un nivel tan bajo, y yuna sin usar sus Summon, bueno en mi perpectiva perdio muchas caracteristicas buenas del FFX."
3,A fair game but disappointing as a sequel.,"In FFX, the intro summarized the entire feel of it, depressing. But it wasn't sickengly depressing; that was just to catch your mood. The plot unfolds into an ending which leaves the player with a refreshed feel.In FFX2, the intro summarized the entire feel of it as well, childish. It was also sickengly childish. If you are one, you will appreciate it, but if not, you will get tired of it quickly. Only during the ending does the mood begin to change, but it finishes so quickly that you say ""SquareSoft should never make a FF sequel again.""The gameplay itself was ok, but ultimately, it was disappointing. It's too bad too, because they actually had alot to work with."
2,Boring....,"A continuation of Final Fantasy X, I was excited to play this game. However, the battle styles are boring, the gameplay gets old really fast. I finished the game to see the ending, which was not worth it. Worse than the ending to Final Fantasy 8! Stick to the classics - FF7,9, 3(6), and 2(4) to get a real final fantasy experience."
1,"FF X-2, game sucks","I read a lot of reviews on FF X-2, and though I love FF games, well lets say X-2 sucked and bad, and I am a female, and I though this game is not interesting. I gave the game back to game stop. FF X is a great game, but I don't know what happened in FF X-2.There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.The game characters looked really weird in my opinion.I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.I would highly recommend renting FF X-2, before you buy this game."
2,"Too much girl power, sexism, and gloating from the girls.","This game a was a let-down. Final Fantasy X; it's prequel, was a lot better than this game full of sexism and girl power.The male characters in No. 10 were awesome! Tidus, Wakka, Auron, now there you have power and ability to kiss ass!! But this, you have 3 girls who are the ONLY characters you control in the game. With all the buitt-kicking like the way 3 girlsw did in Charlie's Angels, it turns me off. I'm a guy so I find it very insulting for these small-waisted, love to dress up, over-bearing pride acting, and physically not that big and should'nt be able to beat guys up that are twice their size EXTRMEELY insulting!!The only reason I keep playing this game is because Tidus will eventually show up and he's one of the cool guys from No. 10.This is a game to make girls feel good and to make guys like me feel like sayin ""What about me?"". Final Fantasy X-2 is way to 'in your face'."
2,A disappointment from Square,"I love all of the previous Final Fantasy games. They all have a good storyline along with excellent gameplay. Final Fantasy X-2 ends that streak though. The idea of continuing with a story from an earlier game is good, but they definitely picked the wrong one to go with. Wouldn't it have been much cooler to see Cloud and the aftermath of FF VII? The story is just terribly uninteresting in this game. What I absolutely hated was the amount of ""humor"" that they tried to put in. I felt like this game was geared more toward 14-year-old girls than to the gamers who have been playing FF all along. Rikku and Brother are the two most annoying characters ever to be in a game. I couldn't stand listening or seeing either one of them. This was the first FF game that I didn't play through a second time. I didn't get the good ending where Tidus comes back, but then again, I didn't care. I hate to say it, but I just wanted it to get over with. Please, do not buy this game."
2,"It's not a video game, but a movie.","The Final Fantasy series is the best roleplaying game series there is. If you like roleplaying video games, you'll love this game. However, this is an indictment of roleplaying games, because this game, well, stinks.In essence, here's how the game works. First, you watch a little CGI sci-fi movie. Then, you scroll through some menus and hit some buttons. If you didn't pick the right buttons on time, you die, and have to start over. If you pick the right buttons, you get to watch another little CGI sci-fi movie. This process is repeated for about 40 hours until you win. (I guess it takes 40 hours. I didn't stick around to find out.)What you purchase when you purchase this game is not really a video game, but a mediocre sci-fi movie, a movie which takes a lot of effort to get to see the ending of. If you want to watch a sci-fi movie, go rent on. If you want to play a video game, play something else."
1,Disgusting,"I am very disapointed with this game. FFX was pretty good though some of the scenes were cheesy...With FFX-2 all you get is ditzy chicks with stupid oneliner. No joke...Paine says ""Ice, Ice, baby"" when she casts Blizzard... This game was supposed to be geared toward women, but instead its just insulting. The three main characters act like bratty 12 year olds. They are supposed to be 19 and 20! Rikku is the most annoying of them all...all she does is whine in a high pitched voice. The dress sphere idea is completely idiotic. They can change dress spheres in the middle of a battle! Overall its a waste of money. If you can borrow it, maybe give it a try...but dont buy it...."
1,Rpg fans beware. This game will disgust you.,"I was skeptical of this game from the start, but I bought it anyway because games with female lead character's amuse me. Let's see what was good about this game.........................................................................................................................................NOTHING!!!! A game where all you do is run around and play dress up. WOW!!! That will appeal to masses ( If your a 12 year old girl ). Any rpg fanatic like me has nothing but respect for Squaresoft and the Final Fantasy series, but my respect level has gone down a few points. I'm sure Squaresoft will be more careful in the future after the horrible reviews this game has received ( I was surprised to see there were actually some high reviews on this game here at amazon ). But no one who knows what good rpg's are all about will give this game a good review. Talking about this game makes me lose my temper so I'm going to quit now."
4,A True Review,"This game was beauiful. Unlike the other FFs this game only had three playable characters but with the DRESS SPHERE changes it seemed like their were more than enough characters. I did finsh this game with only 64% of it completed. The last boss was my only disapointment not to ruin the story we will just say ""it"" was very easy. ""It"" didn't even knock out one of my character during battle. However I did rate this game a 4 out of 5 best game out this season!"
2,WHAT is all the rave about???,"I am a die-hard fan of Kingdom Hearts, and I've heard the fantastic reviews for Final Fantasy. So, I decided to try it out. I rented it at the video store, and boy, what a waste of time!First off, the storyline is just plain lame. No depth. No interest. Nothing. Second of all, the battle system was just kind of bizarre. Boring, a little too complex, and very THINK FAST!!!-ish... Third, if you die (like I did) and you didn't save your game recently, you basically have to start over. Last, all you do is walk a little, fight a little fight, walk a little more, a little cutscene... BORING!!! The only props I can give this game was amazing graphics! This is one thing I wish they had used a little bit more in the Kingdom Hearts games.So, yeah, I've played it. I hate it. I won't be playing it (or any of it's relatives) again."
4,"Not as good as some, but good enough","The camera angles can't keep up with you sometimes, and the girls can get on your nerves sometimes. Otherwise, it's as beautiful as they come. The music is gorgeous. Recommended if you want more of the FF X story."
4,awesome! As always...,"I really don't know how anyone could talk down about this game. Sure, it's storyline is a bit more lighthearted than it's predecessor, but once you begin playing it, you cannot stop. It's controls are easy to get used to, and it's characters are even more easier to love. It has a decent length to it, and it's one of the first FF's to sport a split storyline. The cutscenes are amazing, had they been a movie I would have seen it. They really do bring you into the story, and you feel like you know the characters. There are actually humorous parts to the story, which makes it all the more enjoyable. It has a couple music flaws, because the pop music doesn't appeal to everyone. I think that this really is a solid, enjoyable game. It, for some reason, is kind of inspiring. Just listening to the last few cutscenes makes you feel happy, I mean how could the whole game not? Its a game worth buying, or at least checking out."
2,This sucks toe corn,"This is the most ridiculously stupid game er RPG I have ever played. I would say everything about it sucks but the battle system is kinda cool accept it kinda kills it with the irritating class changing thing. To sum it all up the characters are crap and they remind me of Charlies Angels on stereroids. There voice acting is also pretty pitiful. The story sux because you have to go through half the game until you actually know what your trying to do, and the music is pretty crappy because it sounds like a friggin jazz/wannabe Meriachi band. O and whats up with the 3 main and ONLY characers bein female. They should have atleast brought Auron back or something. In fact this game sux so much I went out of my way to right a review on it."
3,It's different.,"I was kind of disappointed with Final Fantasy X-2. After playing Final Fantasy X, I thought this game would continue on that note. It's about 3 teenage girls, one of them Yuna, who was so grown up and serious in Final FantasyX, and in this game she seems so immature. The game to me is kind of silly. The gameplay consists of different assignments, and you don't get rewarded until the mission is accomplished. Like I said, I personally am not that fond of this game, but teenage girls might like it just fine."
3,Attack of the Mini-games,"Let's face the facts: if you're a confirmed Final Fantasy fanatic already, you're going to buy this game. You'll probably also enjoy the game... with one caveat. The mini-games. More and more mini-games have been creeping into each successive Final Fantasy release, and with this one the sheer number of them borders on complete absurdity. If, like me, you don't relish the idea of spending hours on a ridiculously difficult rythm game knockoff to advance your characters, you're probably going to endure a good deal of frustration with FFX2. Aside from that criticism, it's still a decent RPG. If you're not a die-hard Final Fantasy fan, though, you may want to stear clear."
3,"Good game, but dissapointing","SO let me start off by sayin that i'm not a hardcore FF player. But I can truthfully say that FF7 was probably my favorite game of all time. I didn't play it I lived it. I'm comparing this game to FF7,8,10 cause those are the games i was mostly into. Now FFX2. Graphics - awesome. Sound/Music - off the hook. Gameplay - very good. Storyline - terrible. I don't want to throw any spoilers out there but the storyline wasn't what i expected and not in a good way, it was truly terrible. And come on Square, how are you gonna let me finish this game in 18hrs with my characters on levels 48,47 and 46???? coulda had more playable characters. This game is for true FF fans just to have and experience otherwise it might be a waste of money. Sorry Square but this one is probably the worst FF i have played. Better get some good writers for the next one. The storyline killed this game. :("
2,Strike for Square,"This game is just, well, cheesy. It captures none of the grandiose nature of the Final Fantasy series. There is no breathtaking world to explore, no sense of danger or need to succeed. It really has a half-baked plot you only discover toward the end of the game. This game is aimed much more at the Spice girls/Charlies angels fanclubs than fans of the FF series. I'm just not impressed. I'm still not sure if the $15 I spent on the game was worth it."
2,Different From FFX,"Let me begin by saying that this game is very different from FFX. Do not expect an epic story here. And the battle system is drastically different. All three of the main characters are females. The story takes place in Spira. Yuna, Rikky, and a new character, Paine are Sphere Hunters. They travel all over the continenct searching for these artifacts. The story is very lightweight and definitely not engaging. However, the game is not a bad RPG. If you simply just want to pass the time and play an RPG, then this game will do. Just do not expect it to be anywhere near as good as FFX. In my view, there are many other superior RPGs out there that should be first on your list."
3,A little disappointing...,"Final Fantasy X may very well have been my favorite video game. I felt that FFX-2 did it little justice. I think it had a pretty pointless story line and the characters seemed to change rather dramatically. The entirety of the game was basically a bunch of minigames crammed together. Some were entertaining, but I missed the indepth stories and gameplay that Final Fantasy usually contains.The music, I have to admit, grew on me. It had much more of a jazz feel than any other FF game. I loved it.The three main characters, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, were basically the new ""Charlie's Angels"". This game was alright, but I personally don't recommend it."
2,It hurt to play this.,"Wow. What to say. When I heard FFX was going to have a sequel I was excited... till it came out. FFX-2 consists of the player (who plays as Yuna) running around Spira with Riku and Paine 2 years after the events of FFX. The new costumes of the trio are skimpy (Yuna with her hot pants and Riku managing to fit into an even smaller outfit than what she had in FFX). The music is a weird 70's-marching band-techno which gets very annoying, and I don't even remember the plot because it lacked in having one. They managed to sneek in some scary pop-princess moments, with Yuna singing two pop-tacular songs in the game, and a lot of annoying ""Alright!"" ""We did it!"" *jump and high-five* kind of dialouge. The characters where plain and none really stood out like in past FF games.If you have any respect for FFX, don't play this game. Yet if you want to play it, rent it before wasting more money."
3,This one's just a little different,"I've been playing all the Final Fantasy series since FFVII came out on PSX. I havent beat it yet, but I will in the next day or 2. But so far, this game seems a little more... immature. The girls run around, act like kids, they get mad and say 'oh, poopie' From the end of FFX, Yuna was the highest person in the world, very calm, hides her emotions. Now she's a little 10 year old. I am used to Final Fantasy's with some evil spirit lurking around and always have another evil guy in your way, Sephiroth, Edea, Seifer, Kuja, Seymour. And the music was always awesome when these guys showed up. But now we're down to little tikes music. Nevertheless, I'm going to finish this game to see how the story ends, it has to get better, right?"
2,I really -wanted- to like this.,"This isn't the game they said it would be. Despite preview's promise of this being a non-liner mission-based FF (which is partially true). The percentage completion system is set up in such a linear way, it is nearly impsossible to even get 99% in your first playthrough, and impossible to get 100% w/o some sort of strategy guide due to the arbirartry nature of the linear story.The female characters are occasionally nice to look at, but that's not a reason to play a game. (real women are better) Levelling up is dull, and there's not enough reason to switch out of different dress spheres once you've mastered the abilities.In short, this game doesn't have the 'fun' 'story' or sense of ""I must collect every item"" that previous Final Fantasies brought to me. It's a struggle to make myself even finish this game, and for me that's a lot."
2,Squaresoft has lost its mind,"10-2 was the worst final fantasy in the whole series i mean changing clothes..... its just outta da question if your looking for a real RPG try 7,9 or 10-1 nice graphs though"
2,Not the Final Fantasy I love,"I found this game used at a local store and was pretty excited to play it. Since I'm getting back into gaming and loved Final Fantasy I gave it a try. Wish I hadn't. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this game. Firstly I think the designers were obsessed with hot almost naked girls. It starts off with a concert, what's that about, and then goes into obnoxious interactions between the girls. And all the while I'm not really listening just trying to figure out why do these girls have to be so stupid sounding and so unclothed. It was a bit much. I played for a few hours and still just really couldn't get into. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you are wanting to look at hot imaginary game girls."
1,BRATZ version of Final Fantasy X,"I am not a follower of the FF game line, however I do enjoy linear game play (ie LOTR: The Third Age). I picked up FFX on lark, and fell in love with it! Getting closer to the end of the game, and hearing there was a sequel, I had to try it!I finished FF X, and excitedly put in FF X-2. Then my jaw dropped to the floor and I almost wept.If you enjoyed FF X, this is NOTHING like it! The battle mode is confusing and messy, the sphere grid is gone and replaced with some type of ""barbie dress-up"" spheregrid. The music is beyond annoying and so are the childish antics and attitudes of the characters.I played about 35 minutes and couldn't stomach it anymore....my best advice would be to rent this first to see if it is a style you would enjoy."
3,The whole dress spheres thing didn't do it for me,"I played this back when it first came out because I loved FFX. This one was not as good. Not terrible, but way too girly (and I am a girly girl)."
4,revolutionary,i like the idea of square enix letting you play three girls from this game. because it isn't fair that most of the main characters you play are guys. im a guy and i like girls which is the reason why i got this game. the graphics are as good as ffx. but the gameplay wasn't the best out there such the summons were gone and it's pretty hare to get 100%. anyway this game is pretty much worth your time.
1,bad,"From what I have heard it sounds really bad. I mean heck why would they even want to make a sequal for a good game. And its stupid you can't have most of the characters from the other game but there are only a few new characters and Yuna can't even summon anymore. And some new girl character which her name is pronounced as like some food but i forget. I would say that this will be a very bad game, Final Fantasy X was very good but when Auron and Tidus died it kinda makes it so a sequal would be stupid to have. Bad bad game do not get it but this game will either be very bad or very good so I might be wrong."
1,This game sucks,"I thought the first ffx sucked but now I have seen the worst. If a game has a crappy story then it is no good. You only play as three characters. Yuna is no where near as good as she was in the first game. All this is about is Yuna looking for her boyfriend. Also, graphics are NOT everything. The game's story sucks, just like the first one. If you want to buy a real final fantasy buy ffvii."
3,Girl Power gone to far,"I'd normally be fine with this game casue it sounds really cool and as I was reading a review in a gaming grid I thought it rocked the two words shattered my universe ""garmet grid"" I mean really changing articals of clothing to change class is just not Final Fantasy I mean really it just does not seem ridht but other wise specialy if your a gal buy this game!"
1,As fun as watching paint dry!,"I remember once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away...1997 to be exact. That was the last time Square made a good Final Fantasy game. Now all they make is pure all japanese [stuff]! Seriously this used to be one of my fave companies and FF used to be my fave games, and then they made FF8 which was the WORST THING EVER! and it seems like the ball's just kept rollin'. I happened to play all the other FF games after 8 and I gotta say NOTHING and I mean NOTHING will ever be as good as FF3 (or 6 in japan) and FF7!"
4,Matt Paffords review,Woooooooooooooooooooo! this game is hot. no wonder it is a top seller. Its like jessica simpson choosen liaza venelli instead of nick campebelly. In other words other my rap this is the back door to your hot life. the fighting sucks but the clothes r like beyonce with big *****.
2,Dissapointed,"This is the SAME game as FFX (The previous version). ALL the maps are the same and all the world map is basicly a rip off of the old game with chicks wearing funky clothes. Where is what's his face? Anyway, The cool thing is the battle mode fights are MUCH faster and you can control the speed. There are many cool costume changes and junk. All in all, This game SUCKS! Don't BUY it. Unless of course you a die hard fan, then maybe you like wasting your life in front of it. I give this game 1 star only because the disk would NEVER read and I kept getting errors. It's BRAND NEW and it doesnt work? I think it's my system is messed up more than the NEW game. Thanks Amazon."
4,Its fun but hard,"My son wrote this review :)This is a good game, but very challenging. When I tried to defeat Lebrence they kept on doing their trio attack! I tried to equip other weapons beside their regular ones but it would not work. It was hard to beat the three bad guys. I'll beat them next time!Its a great game. I like it."
2,it got sooooo BORING!! X_X,"when i first bought this game i thought it was gonna be awsome,this game continues on from FFX.yuna just basically wants to find titus...but there is hardly any info mentioned in this game about him.its like she's just doin her own thing and the creator of the game decided to cram some titus stuff into the plot.this game is not what i expected,u basically have to complete missions all over spira some u may skip but if u want %100 then u have to go through all of them to get the perfect ending.its really boring after awhile,i found myself enjoying the missions atfirst :)......but then i was like X_X.to simplify :missionbattlecut sceneairshipand it continues one like that,after a while it gets really boring.If u want to play a good rpg i HIGHLY recommend u play xenosaga :)just gave this review 2 starts becuz of that catchy theme song at the beggning of the game :P"
1,Perhaps I'm the only one who hated this game,"I'm sorry folks, but I was told that since I loved Baldur's Gate and other D&D-style games, I would love Final Fantasy. I bought version X-2 and could barely make it through the 5 minute introdution, which was some Japanese girl in skimpy clothes singing. The beginning of the real game wasn't much better. I'm sure the game has all sorts of things that make you guys love it, and that's great, but for folks who like D&D, Tolkien, and that sort of game, being thrown into a world where the main character is a teenage Japenese girl wearing short shorts, a halter top, and cleavage - oh yeah, and who giggles - was just too much for me. Even my nephews who LOVED the earlier Final Fantasies were laughing at how bizarre this one was. Again, I""m sure it's great for those of you who like this kind of game, but be forewarned - if you like Tolkien and those sorts of characters, this game is not for you."
3,great for long time f-f fans,"My friend loves the Final Fantasy series, but i have never played it.So one day i went and rented it.I figured out that I hate the RPGs, they are so slow! Especially when your getting from one place to another, enemies pop up from everywhere, then once you kill them off, you keep walking and a few seconds later more guys pop up.Then you aventually use up your potions and your characters Die.The graffics are ok,and the storyline is ok.I am more of a fast shooting or at least just fast fighting.You should Rent it first to see if you like it."
3,my god what have they done to u,this is a sad day for all ff fans everywhere the day we have all feard has come the fall of final fantasy u might be wonderin y well this game had great graphics(obviouslly since its an ff) music was ok and the new fast paced battle thing was weird but okbut no way does that excuse what they did with the story line whats with the whole missions thing and le blanc this is final fantasy not team rocket or pokemon and u get 3 characters through the whole game prepare youself there all girls to make things worse they change dresses for abilities YES dresses and if thats not enough u play for 30 hours and only 5 count as the real story line as i said it is a sad day but what can i say at least we're done with yuna
2,This game needs work.,THe battle is awesome and everything. Takes time to get use to. But overall. Its crap. I love final fantasy but this one is one they should have just not sold. Not worth the cash. Stick with FF 11
2,"Good, though highly flawed.","As I see it, the charm of the Final Fantasy series lies in it's labyrinthine plots, and in the almost unique ability of the games to develop their main caracters' personalities.However, I found the main caracters in FFX-2 totally unlikeable, since the dialogue made me cringe every second scene (It's hard to like people when they use expressions like ""heave-ho"" and ""disasteriffic"").The all-female cast came across as juvenile, and square-enix replaced the ambient, atomspheric music of FFX-2's predecessors with bubble-gum pop. Over all, the game has a light-hearted, almost camp feel to it.Having said all that, the FFX-2 can top all the rest in other areas. Fights are faster and have a more fluid feel to them, and the game comes with the usual incredible visuals associated with the final fantasy name.I would recommend this game, but with the warning that it lacks the subtlety and darkness of previous final fantasy games. Buy it, but keep the receipt."
1,"boring,corny, and plain stupid","what complete waste of money, its 10x worse than the first ffxits boring, reading a book is funner than this game"
4,Great Gameplay. Lame Story.,"Being a huge fan of Final Fantasy X from way back when it first came out, I finally decided to give it's sequel a try. I actually forgot this game even existed for a long time but found it in a bargain bin and figured what the heck. I'm not disappointed with it considering I paid under $10. The turn based combat is quicker then any other FF game I've played. And it never gets too too tough as long as you're using the right strategy and have spent the time to level up. Graphics are also impressive...looking just as good if not a little better then FFX did. The biggest turn off is the light hearted story. FFX started out with a city being blow up. FFX-2 starts out with a pop concert. :/ I'm willing to put up with this because the game play is solid enough to make up for it.Final Verdict: If you've never played Final Fantasy X before don't jump into this one first. Get both used and play them in order."
2,Almost dissapointing.,"I just have to say that I played Final Fantasy 10 twice and I loved every minute of it and cried both times. So naturally I was excited to see if Tidus returns in 10-2. The game goofy at best. There is a respectable storyline if you can ignore all the almost pointless (yet required) sidequests like making monkeys fall in love to get tourists out of Zanarkand. I would recommend to anyone willing to play this game (and trust me it will test your love of the game) to look up at least how to see the ""Good"" Ending when reaching the end. The ""Common"" ending is just terribly dissapointing. I'd love to say I loved this game as much as the first, but I spent waaay too much time solving crime for the Al Bhed and digging in the desert to really say it was good."
4,Good Game,I recently recieved my new Playstation magizine and contained a demo of Final Fantasy X-2. Although a good game it seemed a little flawed from the demo disk. For one thing the battles were extremly easy. There was no difficulty at all. Even the battle with Bahument. I mean come on. Also the missions provided on the demo disk seemed slighty easy. Maybe the real game will be more difficult but im only reviewing the demo here. So although this game as its apparent weaknesses like i stated i will still be one of the people waiting to buy this game the day it comes out.
2,This game is crap. Period.,"I waited 2 months for this game to come out. FFX had been an awesome game, but this....this, REPULSIVE game is just terrible. It took one of the better characters and made her a stripper. ANd as far as plot, heres the script.*talk talk talk giggle giggle giggle**gossip**oh Tidus flashback ah im so sad!!* (rolls eyes)Go buy FFX or IX, this game should be burned."
3,pretty disapointing and not very disapointing,the reason i gave x2 a 3 stars is beacuse the story sucks like hell and you can't get party members or weapons and armor but the battling is fun and so is doing all the sidequests to get 100% and view the perfect ending to me this is maybe the foruth best final fantasy oh and buy the way im person who reviewd ff8 im the one who beat ff8 9 and 7 that ends my review
1,SideQuest: THE VIDEO GAME,"Sigh... Square, WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A GAME!!! the one thing that pisses me off about this is that there are SO MANY DARN SIDEQUESTS! It took me about an hour after completing a sidequest to get back to the main story, wich isn't much of a story at all. Also, in FFX, Yuna was quiet and somewhat mysterious, and now she's a friggin pop singer! WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH THAT? The battle system with the dresspheres is, to my taste, CRAP. the only good thing is the awesome cinematics. And where's Tidus? And Lulu? Sure, keep the hyperactive girl with a single-digit IQ and the weird summoner and leave out that ball-chucking guy from FFX (forgot his name) All in all, this game sucks."
2,screwed up final fantasy ever,what the hell kind of final fantasy is there that u only get 3 guys in the whole game u can't buy any weapon's or armor and u can't use any summon's i was really disapointed in square this time beacuse they could have made it better damn whoever came up with x2 screw u(...)
4,FINAL FANTASY X-2 GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,im sooooooooo glad they are making a sequel for Final Fantasy XFFX was my favorite FF game ever im glad the main character has guns now instead of a sword in the previous one they ALWAYS!!!!!had a sword and also im glad that the main fighters are girls no problems here this game is going to ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Must Buy For FF Fans,"Final Fantasy X-2 departs from the usual track set by its predecesor (Final Fantasy X which must be played to fully appreciate the sequel) and ultimately creates a whole new gameplay experience. While the graphics may look indentical, the combat system has been completely redone with inspirations from the standard turn-based system, Chrono Trigger, Grandia, and Final Fantasy Tactics, all in in one. The battle system is rather complex, and it may take a little (it did for me in any case) to get a handle on it. The story also departs from the darker, more emotional story of Final Fantasy X, and as a whole, is more lighthearted and may not appeal to all RPG fans."
2,Big Let Down,"This game is by far the worst Final Fantasy game. I liked every other one. I am open minded with RPGs and applaud people for doing new things, but this game falls way short. If you like the minigames in FF games, this is your game. If you like to go to the same places over and over and over again, this is your game. If you like to play dressup and you like to play games with little story, this is your game. If you like pop music videos in the middle of the game or like minigames where you practice dancing or give someone a massage, this is your game. If not, just read a walkthrough to find out what happened to Tidus."
3,Different from the rest of the series,"Wow...this game was not even close to what I expected it to be. You only get to have three characters (and they're all the same gender) throughout the entire game. The battle system is way too fast-paced (i.e. you can't even tell what's going on in battle---enemies just attack whenever they want. It's more of an all-or-nothing brawl instead of a classic RPG). Instead of the original, classic sphere grid from FFX, it's a garment grid (a grid of different dresses for your party members to wear). There's not much of the old Final Fantasy goodness in this game, such as special magic abilities.Overrall, this game is reasonable, and it could've been improved in many places."
4,"Not the very best, but awesome...","Well...the graphics are the best I've ever seen, the music is gorgeous, and I love all of the characters...The biggest problem I have with it, though, is that the game doesn't have as much of a story as the many others did. Final Fantasy X-2 just has missions where they go around the world and find spheres...It's just not a great story that I could get wrapped up in. =(Don't get me wrong! I'm a HUGE final fantasy fan...I just couldn't get caught up in this story. I know I'm not too helpful. O_o It's kind of difficult to explain. The characters, voices, music, graphics, and ending is all perfect...It just took me a long time to beat it since I found myself taking a break from the rather boring story and playing Final fantasy 7, 8, and the others. hahaha..."
1,They ruin the theme songs,"The english version of Real emotion sounds awful. They should have kept the original japanese version, it sound so much better."
3,My two cents.,"Okay. I absolutly love Final Fantasy and all. But why Squaresoft? Okay, the graphics are great. I will admit that, but the storyline is just bad. Well, to me anyway. I never liked FFX in the first place, it was one of those games in which I could play it for 10 minutes, get bored of it, stop, then come back later and play another 10 minutes. I bought it last year, and I still have yet to beat it! I know the ending because I just went on KaZaA and downloaded it. I just could not finish the game. The ending was okay, from what I saw. But the question is.. why make a sequel!? If you were to make a sequel to a FF game, it should have been 7. Ever since 8.. everything has gone down the drain, even though I liked Kingdom Hearts and FF9. I'm sorry, but unless you just like pretty light shows and [weak] voice overs, then you will not like this game, or you might. What do I know? I gave it 3 stars, because of it's pretty lights ^_^;;"
1,Sequel? What sequel?,"This game was ridiculous and I was EXTREMELY disappointed with it. Being a huge fan of FFX, I was stoked for part two. Then, just with the intro of the game, I was pissed. This game blows. It's like Britney Spears designed a game and then threw up bubble gum on it while girls threw glitter in the air. This game is so girly and so overwhelmingly in direct contrast to the characters we used to know that I kept asking ""What the hell is going on?"" Since when have popstars been in the history of Spira? Apparently forever says the game. Stupid stupid premise for a sequel to an awesome awesome game."
1,boring,"i didnt know that i had to be 13 years old and be a girl to play this game. i would have instead bought my self some barbies instead. basically yuna acts like a 13 year old, paine like a 14 year old pretending to be 21 and rikku, oh gosh, she's the most annoying of them all, like a spoiled brat. yuna isnt the character she played in ffx, now shes more, WAY more immature...and the dancing and singing, yuck, ill turn it on mute."
2,Funny..,"This game is good for a laugh or two, I'm not against it, It's fun but if you are into the newer final fantasy games I reccommend getting crystal chronicles instead!"
2,A disapointment.,"If you've never played the very first Final Fantasy, but would just because of the name, than this is the game for you.If you get off watching fake girls in thier underwear, than this is the game for you.If you loved Final Fantasy X, and are looking to continue the story... just let Titus die! This game is a watered down, half baked wet dream of someone's. It's obviouse that no real thought went into the plot. And no real work went into the making.Send a message to Square. If you're going to make a sequal, don't just ride on the first games popularity, put some heart into it! Oh yea, don't let men in heat create the story plot.I could go on about all the small flukes in the game, but I've allready wasted my time playing it. You really want to know so bad, go waste your money on the game."
1,Square-Enix merger=disaster,"Descent gameplay. Horrible story. I swear, the Square/Enix merger focus so much on gameplay that the story lacks. It's really sad. Plus it's the only game where you need a strategy guide just to get a descent ending. Horrible Horrible Horrible. And it's final fantasy."
1,Dosen't live up to the series expectiations,"If you've come to this game because you're a big fan already of final fantasy, loved final Fantasy X, or are just looking for a fun game to play, you've come to the wrong game. As an avid final fantasy fan I immediatly jumped on this game as soon as it came out, but was grossly dissapointed. The characters they reused from the first game were perverted in the sense that they were grossly changed (ex. costumes were made emensly slutty) and the story plot was WEAK. In addition to this, I was able to beat the game in less than a month! And by only holding down the x button during all battles none the lesss! It dosen't matter why you want to play this game, be it stroy pot, reputation, or battle system, this game is not something you want to have seen on your game shelf."
3,Great but....,"Alrighty, first, this game is awesome. The control functions are a little choppy but that soon is mastered. The real thing that made me give it a three star is my game in particular is defective. At certain points in the game, it freezes up and it did come scratched. It has gotten rather annoying so check to see if the actual disk has something wrong with it BEFORE you play. *sigh* maybe amazon should not sell scratched games but OH WELL they've been great up to this point."
2,Bad plot + Bad Gameplay+ Bad voice acting = ff x-2,"Alright where to start. Yuna is looking for Tidus after the events of Final fantasy 12 and finally recieves a lead in the form of a video sphere. Sounds like a good setup but its not. From there things just go downhill. A friend of mine once had trouble beating a boss so i told him ""just hold down the x button and they will manually attack"" and this actually worked for the entire game. X-2 is a standard turn based rpg except the characters all move and attack alot faster than usual. There is a job class system that also changes the characters's clothes. The dressup/job system is actually fairly entertaining as you can switch classes during battle and gain new jobs. That said the gameplay isn't very original, the voiceacting is just as bad as before(rikku is still annoying), and Yuna became a ho. This game is the actual reason why square doesn't repeat a story in the final fantasy series; sequels always suck"
5,FFX-2 Rocks!!!!!!!,"FFX-2 is a GREAT game! The batlle sequence is way better than FFX's. if you're looking for fun this game is for U! However the plot (if there is one) sucks! It shouldn't be sphere hunter, but trying to steal their clothes back! I mean seriously, Rikku wears a [...], mini skirt with a thong sticking out the sides of it! Yuna's lost her pants, and Paine's a h_ _ _ _r! This game is clearly made for older kids. But still this game is GREAT! I reccomend this game to a 13-year-old Final Fantasy fan like myself."
5,Awesome,"RPG games are my favorite genre, and this is one of the games that makes it so. With an action-filled combat system, a non-linear and awesome storyline, and great voiceovers make this game worthwile. I recommend it to any gamer, RPG fan or not."
4,its ok,"hello im here to tell you about this game. This game is ok nad not that great. the only reason i got it is because i like final fantasy and im trying to get the whole collections. the graphics good, the story ok, the characters suck. the characters are so annoying, but the battle system kept me playing.Also this game doesn't have the famous theme song after you win a battle(if your a real final fantasy person you know what i'm talking about). if your a noob at the ff series this is a good game to get, but for all you ff pros dont bother unless you want the whole sereies. the best ff game is ff7"
5,FInal Fantasy X-2,"First of all this game is pretty easy when compared to FF-X, but I like everything about it better. The graphics, music,personalities, and gameplay. Even if you didn't play X you will really enjoy X-2.Characters - 9/10Music - 8/10Graphics - 10/10Replay - 9/10Overall - 10/10"
1,FFX-2 ruins a classic tragedy!,"Imagine if they made Romeo and Juliet 2, and they had Romeo and Juliet come back to life and live happily ever after. Now you know what Final Fantasy X-2 is all about.Now that I know how FFX-2 turns out, I don't have need to keep my original FFX copy that I always thought of as a classic treasure. FFX had a definite ending, and realistically it was about one thing, a tragic romance. When FFX-2 was announced, I think it was obvious how it would turn out, and it does turn out that way. I was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable. I kept telling myself, something else has to happen, it can't turn out like a Disney fairytale, but deep down inside I think I knew it.Anyway, as far as I'm concerned I just needed confirmation that this was true, so that I wouldn't waste my time playing the game. I don't think I'll ever play another Final Fantasy game again. The Final Fantasy train stops here."
2,"Wonderful, if you are an 11 year old girl.","I am female and purchased this game because I liked Final Fantasy X so much. This, however, is a very lame follow up. The fighting controls are very different and you have to fight fiends with song and dance. The story is very poor in comparison to X, and the entire game just feels half baked and childish."
5,A sequel have NOT EVA BEEN BETTA!!!,"A Hit once agian! Yuna traveling to found out wut TRULY happend to Tidus (if finished FFX)- Sadly, you only play 3 chracters: Yuna,Rikku,and a new player name Paine. This time it is sooo much betta!! Da outfits look titer! and da game can't get anymore betta!!!!"
3,Ehh...Not terrible,"The game's storyline was a little. . .odd, but so was FFX's. Some people think this game is way better than FFX; my opinion is a bit different. The battle system frustrated me. . .They attack you when you are choosing your moves. At first it was wacky, then it just got annoying. After about an hour (probably less), I quit playing, holding my head in frustration. The old FFX battle system was a lot better (for me, who always forgets to pause x.x), since it gave you as much time as you needed. Overall, I'd say this game would be better for people who could make smart decisions quickly :-)"
4,Not bad at all.,"There were some rough spots in this game, as all games have rough spots, but over all, the game was a lot of fun. Easy in some places, challenging in some, but it's not bad at all. It was a fun play."
3,Very ordinary,"This is not a bad book, it is just not a very good one. I read it in one day but that is because it was insubstantial, not because it was fascinating. With all the great ""Age of Sail"" naval fiction out there, save your money and time by skipping this one. If Aubrey & Hornblower are a ""T-Bone"", Fairaday & Marlborough are a ""Big Mac"", without the special sauce."
3,"A novella, at most","This is the shortest piece of fiction I've ever seen advertised as a novel. Not only is it only 192 pages, but that includes all the blank ones; the book doesn't even start until page 9. Each chapter wastes roughly another page, making it about 170 pages. These pages have the widest margins, the fattest inter-line spacing, and even the fattest inter-word spacing I've ever seen. My estimate is roughly 25K words, and that makes it on the short side for a novella, much less a novel.The book is otherwise a fairly run of the mill nautical adventure with the ""twist"" being that it's following both a British lieutenant and a revolutionary one. Not bad, but the author should wait until he has a novel's worth of material."
1,Nothing really new.,"I bought this book in hopes to getting real inside information. All of this information could easily be obtained at any library. Also, there was really not a lot of actual information in the book. The font was so large, that it could have been written in about 35 pages. The rest of the book had addresses to pharmaceutical companies. What a rip off.To top it all off she tries to sell you more literature and services she should have included in this book."
3,Just Like the last review.... hard to beat,"This game is pretty cool, lacking color, and the different character each fighter shows, which brings out the game's Brutal side. Although this freaking game is so hard to beat. I remember the warp ups and gosh were they hard to pick up. But it's a challenge to those who think they are game masters."
2,Crappy...but funny,"This game reminds me of a bad low budget action b-movie.The graphics are digitized,so it gives the fighters somewhat of a real look to them,but good lord...this game sucks.You choose from three diffrent fighters.A wrestler,a karate guy and a kickboxer.You fight diffrent fighters,who look completly ridiculous,and have goofy names like CC Rider,who is this biker dude that you fight in a bar.You gotta keep winning fights to get your cash stack to get higher and higher.Yet there is ABSOLUTLEY nothing to do with it,once you've made it.This is a very bad fighting game.I can't think of ONE good thing about this.Its that bad.Only reason I gave it a two instead of a one,is because it sucks...but it's still worth a good laugh or two lol"
3,Cute,"I was looking for a more well made or solid rendition of my patron saint. This kid version is all I could find. It looks kind of silly on my bookcase in the office but every since I got it, business has been great. Don't discount a saint regardless of how they are made."
4,Another wonderful read in the series,"In the fifth installment of The Royal Ballet School Diaries, the girls' start their first summer term. Ellie and her friends are thrilled when they learn that two past R.B.S. students, who are now world- renowned dancers, will be filming a documentary at the school. Everyone is ecstatic for the opportunity to meet the dancers and get a chance to be on film -- except for Kate. Ellie doesn't understand why and tries to find out. The girls are shocked to learn why, but with Ellie around, no one can be upset for long. This is just another example of how to be a good friend and realize that some problems are not as bad as they seem. As usual with the series, it is a good story about ballet and friends. Everyone will enjoy this book, and also the series. And as I stated in my previous reviews in the series, the only thing that I don't care for in The R.B.S. Diaries are that at times they can sound like a R.B.S. advertisement. Other than that, it is highly enjoyable!"
1,Ridiculous,"There have always been 13 constellations, but the Zodiac is not literally the 13 constellations... Anyone who has studied astrology knows that the planets are not actually in the constellations named by the signs... This is ludicrous..."

3,not special at all,"This band is a copy of all other bad, generic, power metal. I really don't think this band is good at all."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I had not heard of this book until it popped up as a recommendation for me. The synopsis appealed so I ordered it and I am so glad I did. It is a wonderful book, moving and well written. It made me wish I knew the author personally because I certainly felt I knew him when I reached the end of the book. This is one I will read more than once. Highly recommended."
1,This product is horrible,I purchased this product for Mother's Day and was shocked at the poor quality - the surface felt like sandpaper and had no likeness to any china I own - it is Made in China and is an embarrassment to the Old Country Roses pattern put out by Royal Albert what can they be thinking - it is just terrible quality - like you would find at the dollar store! I returned it.
2,Great concept. Poor execution. Poor support.,"I bought my z540 in November 2004. It NEVER really workd: I had some problems with the DVD player, with the TV tuner, etc. HP Support has this great online chat feature but decisions are hard to get. They had me replace the DVD reader (they sent me wrong instructions, applying to another type of machines...), they then wanted ME to re-install the operating system. They were not happy when I mentioned I could not transform myself in an IT guru. I asked for a replacement or a refund. Got none of these. Had to ship the computer for repair, per HP under 6 to 9 business days. It's been a month now and HP Support just called me pushing the delivery date by 5 to 7 more business days (totaling about a month...).Conclusion: I don't know what you will do, but if I personally had to do it again, I would not re-do it... Not with HP... I love the concept of a PC being my radio, TV, CD, DVD, etc. all into one box... not with HP..."
4,A highly technical account of the Air war (iran/iraq),A great reading. You'll learn tactical issues faced by Iranian pilots whose U.S. training had a huge effect on the air war. The advantages that Iran initially had in the air and eventually lost to Iraq over the years as the war dragged on and the rest of the world opened up to Saddam Hussein. Lots of pictures to supplement the pilot's stories and accounts. Nicely done.
4,Impressive performance by Iran's pilots,"Agree with the review that says maps would have been the final piece of the puzzle. The level of research involved in this book is impressive (the pictures in particular), though necessarily one-sided.Even with expected inflation of claims from Iranian pilots, the performance of their Air force under pressure from both the Iraqis and their own incompetent government was something they can be very proud of. Most of these guys were freed from jail and torture, and still fought for their country with skill, intelligence, and courage. I'm glad someone went out and told their stories."
3,Misleading title. The book is not about Alexander Technique.,"Although the book carries the title ""Alexander Technique"" it does not teach it. The authors emphasize throughout their book, that the Alexander Technique can be learned only with the help of specially trained teachers and not by reading a book. So, instead of Alexander's technique, the authors offer their own set of exercises, called Leibowitz Procedures. According to the authors, these procedures help you learn to observe yourself in motion, but they are not identical with Alexander Technique. A few pencil drawings accompany extensive descriptions but unless you know what instructions such as ""let your neck be free and your legs release away from the torso"" mean, they are not too useful."
1,Out of date,"Has a lot of good background, but if you are looking for in-depth information about the Pentium family, you should likely skip this book. The ""Pentium and Pentium Pro"" chapter starts page 753, ""Pentium II, III and 4"" starts page 783, and ""Appendixes"" star page 802, meaning 30 pages and 19 pages respectively on the last two Intel processor families.Several references in the book state things like ""just introduced"" or ""this year"", but were obviously from early editions.I recognize how hard it is to keep up to date - The current (as of this writing) architecture documents from Intel on IA-32e and AMD for AMD64 are several thousands of pages and free for download. Of course, I never expected 64 bit architecture discussion in this book, but but I was looking for a narrative that would set the base and context of modern 32 bit implementations."
4,"A Good Book, but it needs a bit editing","It's a really Good Book, very thorough. But it lacks editing for the new revisions. There are quite a few chapters that concerns DOS only, and these days it would be hard to find a person that finds this interesting.Those chapters could very well be exchanged for information on XP, Win 2003 or even Linux. And now I mentioned Linux: this OS is completely ignored in the text. When the author lists the 32 bit operating systems, he event counts Win95 and Win98, but excludes Linux and Unix!?So: A very nice read that could have been better."
2,Unhelpful and Scattered,"I'm currently studying Electronic Engineering, and this is our recommended text for the introduction to assembly module. I find i can't use the book as it does not lay out any subject clearly. Often parts of the language are used in examples then introduced and explained many pages later. If starting you have to get at least one other book."
3,"Nice fabric, good fit-n-finish, but poor tayloring","I ordered size 15-1/2 x 31 trim fit. The product description said trim fit. Unfortunately, the shirt feels anything but ""trim"". You'd think a size like 15-1/2 x 31 would be trim to start with, but even though I got a trim fit version, the shirt feels way too baggy all around."
1,frustrated w/ Wagner,"12 years ago, a neighbor purchased a Wagner Power Paint Sprayer - and returned it in the same day, as it just did not work for more then one or two passes. We recently purchased one, figuring with the passing of time that the company would have made improvements to their product - they have not. At first we were excited by the speed and ease in which we were able to get things painted... that lasted about five minutes. The unit repeatedly seizes up - and no amount of thinning the paint helps. We've cleaned it, oiled it, done everything anyone has suggested for trouble shooting. This is more frustration then it is worth. Very disappointing, because if the company would care to improve the product so that it actually worked - this would be a very handy tool to have and SHOULD make life much easier. But, we'll be returning ours today after another failed attempt to get some painting done. Two thumbs down, Wagner!!!!"
2,"Stain yes, latex NO!","If you're staining a deck or a fence, then this is a great tool.But it cannot handle latex paint. It spits and sputters and makes a huge mess. It's simply not powerful enough. When you read the fine print, it says latex paint should be first thinned down before spraying."
1,Not worth the frustration,"I'm giving this 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. I wasted half my day with this before returning it to Lowes. The inherent design of the product allows paint to enter the piston, which pumps the paint. The heat caused from friction in the piston drys and gums up the paint therefore ceasing the piston. For every 30 secconds of painting I spent 5 minutes cleaning the piston. This was after thinning the paint to 75% water even though they say thinning is not required. I bought another piston thinking that maybe something was wrong with it but it continued to do the same thing. Wagner has to know it is selling an inferior design yet they continue to do so. All the other Wagner power painters work under the same concept so I imagine they will have the same problem. There is a reason brushes and rollers are still around, THEY WORK!"
5,Great tool - works incredibly well,"I was hesitant to purchase because of the poor reviews, but I was able get a great deal on this model and took a chance. After a only a quick glance over the instructions I assembled the painter and began to paint a very large deck. I was amazed - it worked flawlessly and with unthinned oil based stain as well. I was able to paint the entire deck in a small fraction of the time compared to a brush and roller. No sputtering, just an even consistent spray. It sputters when it is close to empty but thats expected. Clean up was simple an quick - the unit is very well engineered to unassemble and clean. The only down side was that it went through paint very quickly. Its hard to understand the reviews for this model. One of the best tools I own."
4,misrepresentation,"The chocolate cake is misrepresented in the photograph above. I received the dessert basket today and was surprised to see that the inside of the chocolate cake has three layers of colors(like above)but they are not white/pink/white. They are GREEN, YELLOW and PINK. Very strange colors for a cake. It looks like a flag...not something you would like to eat. Everything else is exactly as it is shown. The donuts are big...they are the best part. The wedding cake is large as well. The cookies and bon bons are small. The basket is cheap...but the food is the best part."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and was not the same basket that was pictured. Contained 2 pieces of chocolate cake and different cookies and also contained a glass of milk."
1,un-usable on ceramic and glass stoves,"Ceramic & Glass stovetop users beware! After getting this product, I was sorely disappointed to read it is un-useable on ceramic or glass cooktops. This information should be made available on the box, or in product description...not lying in wait for the consumer upon opening and reviewing the user guide. Sorry Emeril, back to my Logic cast iron."
1,Warped and cracked after 1 use,i thought this would be a great piece to use in my kitchen but noticing the griddle being warped after placing it on the burners THEN in cracking during my first use totally turned me off. Emeril missed it on this one.
2,Warped....,"Received this as a gift. Unfortunately, it is warped and doesn't sit flat on my cook surface. Pressing on one corner and the opposite corner raises about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch. Lack of quality control. It heats well enough, but may be relegated to a campfire cookware since warping won't really be noticed. I don't care for the 'grill' side since the groves are so deep it makes cleaning and drying (crucial to cast ironware) difficult. The handles are flush with the cook surface making picking up a knuckle burn hazard and dumping grease a mess (grease channels is too small/narrow). Coating is very rough and not suitable for 'fragile' cook items such as fried eggs over easy.Overall not impressed, the design isn't well thought out (handles, grease channel and grill groves). Lodge does a much better job with their cookware, though I don't believe they make a similar shaped item."
1,Quality Concerns - Cracked almost in half before 1st real use...,"My gf and I just bought this product tonight from Bed Bath & Beyond, and after cleaning it and placing it on the stovetop to begin to preheat, it made a loud popping noise which ended up being due to it cracking almost in half. We didn't even get the opportunity to try it out to comment on how well and evenly it cooks. We refuse to chance using it at all with a crack in its structure. Cracking seems to be a pretty significant event for something that heavy and that is cast iron.For owners of this product, please be careful with it, in case this isn't an isolated incident."
2,Handle cracked on 2nd use. Quality issues?,"I purchased this locally for use as a stove-top grill/griddle. It performed admirably in it's first use, but was a bit of a pain to clean (compared to well-seasoned standard cast-iron). The very next day as it was heating up over medium-high heat, and I heard a loud pop on the stove. On examining the griddle, one of the handles had cracked at joint. I will be returning it to seek a standard non-enameled cast iron griddle."
2,Coating flakes off,"I have owned this griddle for about a year, and in the last couple months, the enamel coating has begun to warp and flake off. Granted, my griddle gets almost daily use, but only moderately high heat on my gas stovetop. I'm very disappointed, since I own several Lodge pieces and have never had any trouble with flaking. Save yourself the trouble and get a cast iron piece without the enamel coating."
2,So disappointed!,I just bought this grill and have used it twice on my gas range. It has a very rough surface. In spite of putting lots of oil on it everything still sticks. Cleanup is a nightmare. I followed the instructions completely.I love the rest of my Emeril products but this one is the worst!
1,Three words . .Do Not Buy.,"I received this as a christmas gift, since my electric grill/griddle broke (which I loved). I was looking for something that would take up less counter space. When I got it I was excited seeing that it was from Emeril and couldn't wait to use it, but here is why it got one star.Cons. 1. Takes a long time to heat up and cool down.2. No matter how much spray, oil or butter the food sticks.3. Since the food sticks clean up is very very hard. . taking me at least 15 min since it take so long to cool down by time you get to it the food is caked on pretty good.4. Only used it 4 times and it is very dull and has a rough texture.5. Since you have to load up on oil and butter for non sticking major smoke not good for inside.Pros. 1. Might be good for outdoors, but that is all I can think off."
1,Enameled Coating big Dissapointment,"For those of you who want a review from a lover of cast iron that actually owns this...I love all my cast iron cookware, except this one. The enamel coating on it is horrible. I'm not sure you should even season something that has been enameled, and I would be willing to try (probably ruining the griddle completely), except that this griddle really does not hold heat evenly. I am going to give this one back to my mother in law and buy a lodge logic.sorry Emeril, you rock, just don't like this piece."
2,Cracked cast iron griddle,I own a small cast iron skillet that I love and keep very well seasoned. I've been wanting a larger skillet to do some stovetop grilling. I purchased the single burner one because I felt the double burner one was too heavy/large for storing in my cabinets. I used it a few times and love the versitality of having a flat side and a grill side. I just pulled it out the other day to roast some chilis. I had it on my electric burner on med-high and heard a pop sound. I couldn't figure out what it was. And then I heard it again and saw that the griddle had a crack in the middle of it. I have never had any problems with high heat and cast iron before. I am very disappointed in the quality of this piece. Cast iron should be able to withstand searing hot temps.
4,It works well for what I want it to do.,"First of all I will say there are no diet pills out there that work as well as anything with Ephedra (which is now banned). This pill does do what I want it to do. I just wanted something that would suppress my appetite and it's doing a great job. The key to losing weight is eating healthy and working out. I just have trouble with control, and this pill definatly helps and makes me not hungry. I'm a little leary that there is a hormone in it though."
3,Slim Quick causes jitters,"I found that the product works in controlling my hunger, but I could not take the recommended dose of 4 a day because it made me so jittery. The product also caused sleep disturbance if taken as directed."
1,not so great,"I had mood swings, gained weight and was very dissappointed with this product. I had heard such great things. Maybe it just wasn't good for my body type."
1,I can't say anything,"This CD never arrived, and it sure looks like it never will. Obviously I can't review it, though I wish I could."
5,Fighting at its best,I remember this game as the best fighter in its day. its controls being much simpler then the newer versions and has that good old classic feel
1,Mortal Combat,I asked for a super nintendo game and you sent a sega tape. That is what was on your invoice so I hate it because you sent the wrong tape and it freezes up every teo seconds
2,I SEEMED TO HAVE LIKED THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION MORE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME YOU CAN BUY. THE GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE, THE FIGHTS ARE BORING, AND THIS VERSION JUST LACKS THE DEPTH OF THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION. ONLY REASON I DON'T GIVE THIS THING 1 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE CODE THAT YOU CAN USE TO UNLOCK THE GORE AND THE FATALITIES THAT AREN'T FOUND ON THE OTHER VERSION. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, STICK WITH THE FAR SUPERIOR SUPER NINTENDO VERSION. THIS VERSION AIN'T WORTH LOOKING FOR."
2,Beware BW no color,"Deitel books are great because they come in full color (a great pedagogic help), this one doesn't, this book is worthless without color, Thers is no value added in it, no diferentiation, you can use others instead."
4,Read the book to get the best out of it,"The best way to learn C# or any programming language is to type out and debug many programs. This book provides many examples for the same. Although I find this book too wordy, I recommend to read the book to get the best out of it."
2,Lots of filler pages of code,A good book is short and concise. This book for all the pages is missing good explainations and details about the topics.Their thinking is 4 pages of code is good info. Its not. A explaination then a short block of code is good info.
5,Excellant book on c#,This is an excellant book on C# for programmers and also for those who don't know any programming.Deitel books are recommended for everyone. I trully enjoy their books.
3,"Good Songs, Poor Quality","I agree with bigtimemusic lover: the sound quality of ""The Ultimate Otis Redding"" is sub-par. Although the choice of tracks is admirable, the mushy audio does not do Otis justice. If you still have your turntable hooked up, compare a hit track from an Otis LP (such as Atco's ""The Best of Otis Redding"") to the same track on this CD. You will be amazed at the difference.If I were to own just one Otis Redding recording, it would have to be ""Live in Europe"". The energy, the crowd and - most especially - Otis' electric performance - make ""Live in Europe"" indispensable."
2,Rating Is For This Package NOT For The Quality Of The Music,"While I agree wholeheartedly with all the reviewers of the quality of Otis Redding's music, I must break away from the ranks and say that the sound of this CD stinks. It sounds very weak and sterile (as do most of the CDs from the Warner Special Products label that were issued in the mid 80's), something that isn't deserving of Otis Redding's stature. Pick up Rhino's The Very Best Of Otis Redding (either volumes), or better yet, pick up the 2-CD set ""Dreams To Remember"" which is PACKED with the good stuff as this CD just doesn't cut it.Peace."
3,"An Okay Starters Compilation For Otis Redding Beginners, But Lacking Some Crucial Tracks & The Sound Quality Not The Best!!","When I first bought this compilation of the legendary Otis Redding back in 1990,I immediately realized that this was not TRULY the ULTIMATE Otis Redding collectionbecause ""Lover's Prayer"" and his rendition of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" waspainfully missing from the fray!--The true ULTIMATE OTIS is the 2 CD-set called""Dreams To Remember: An Otis Redding Anthology"" released in 1998!But if you're just discovering Otis Redding's work, then this CD is adecent effort at familiarization. Of course, listening to it by today'ssonic standards, I would say it could benefit from modern remastering andrestoration technologies immensely!So, I guess overall, I'd give this collection a solid C+"
1,Stay Away from this Otis Redding CD,"This CD may have most of Redding's great songs but it was horribly mastered. You're throwing good money away. I'm looking to buy another compilation of his music and crossing my fingers, hoping that I don't get ripped off again. This is the sad state when fans are subjected to unscrupulous scoundrels that slap together a CD and mass produced it to make a buck with no concern for quality. I see that other reviewers gave this CD 5 stars but they happen not to care about quality sound--just blind fans. I demand quality."
4,Otis Redding Primer,"If you don't have money for the box set or the 2 CD set or just want a primer for Otis Redding's sound, then this is it. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is that it lacks his amazing *Dreams to Remember*.I have spent countless nights ruminating over lost love while listening to Otis's lovely gruff voice and his great backing band. Listen to #3,4,5,7,9,13,17 or 18 to get a taste of his unparrelled soul balladery.You can't go wrong with this one."
3,good variety of dinos,Good variety of dinos but cuts cookies too thinly in places like the tails or necks.
5,Fun Cookie Cutters,I ordered these for my 3 1/2 yr old son who is very into dinosaurs right now. They are a great inexpensive set of cookie cutters.
1,"oleuropein, an important ingredient","your company is not doing this company good justice. I will not order anything without checking out the content of this very important ingredient, and i can not see from the label how much percentage of the oleuropein contained. I do not buy from the amount percentage of the product; I buy based upon how much of the oleuropein it contains."
4,Very Good Book,"I recently switched to the field of Pathology, this was one of the first books that was recommmended to me, definitely worth it, simple and concise, gives the basics about dissection of specimens."
3,"Interesting, but....",This book is interesting but it does not present anything new on the subject of A. Lincoln's spiritual beliefs. It would be a worth-while read for a junior high or high school student interested in this subject.
5,Best realistic cartoon EVER!!!,"What you will find inside this cartoon are the most beautiful principles of life. REMI will capture your attention till the end of the story. It will teach everybody who reads, watch or listen this story the most valuables lessons of life. It is a complete guidance for any growing kid or even older people who due to the stress of life normally separate themselves from nature and emotions. I wathced the whole cartoon when I was a kid and now 30 years later, I watched it again and learned this time more values than the first time. It is incredible how a cartoon can instill great values to a person. It must be assigned to schools as a mandatory lesson. I really recommend this story."
5,Awesome! Love It!!,"Bought This As A Gift For My Husband Who Watched This As A Young Boy, & He Loved It! Great Quality! Very Impressed!"
1,remi la serie complete boxset 6 dvd,"well I'm still waiting for the product, honestly i dont think im going to get iti rarely use this cc and this time i used it becuase it has a low limit 500.00well right after i placed my order someone was trying to buy a computer for 3,000.00and the bank called to let me know they were cancelling my cc due to that...i stillpaid my balance but no product....very dissapointed..."
4,The Brazilianists' Brazil,"Latin American Research Review, No. 35/1, 2000, contains a review article entitled ""The Brazilianists' Brazil: Interdisciplinary Portraits of Brazilian Society and Culture,"" by Piers Armstrong. It contains about a page and a half on ""Brazilian Mosaic."" I suggest you may want to include that excerpt as a review of my book.G. Harvey Summ"
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I had thought this book would be a neutral, scholarly approach to Gospel of Matthew in light of the customs in Palestine at the time of Jesus. But at least half the book is related to the doctrines of the Unity Church, of which one of the authors/editors is a minister of. A lot of the commentary has nothing to do with Near East customs, but is based on the teachings of the Unity Church. I did get some useful information out of the parts that were actually about the customs (hence two stars and not one); but the ratio of useful information to the size of the book wasn't enough to justify me buying the book."
1,rather biased,The author's disdain for progressive rock negates the book's credibility as a resource for all music fans. One star.
5,"Awesome game, satisfying experience..requires patience","Puerto Rico is a must play upgrade for board gamers who are still into monopoly, magic or catan.This requires a bit more patience, is more challenging, reduces luck factor and is a truely satisfying experience...need couple of boards to get into the game...try to read the online reviews before actually start playing....once into the groove no looking back"
4,Excellent board game!,Excellent game for 2 as well as 4. The game itself should have come with better storing materials; lots of little pieces and no individual ways of storing them. A challenging and thought provoking game with many options for variations.
4,it's all about strategy,"Great game, once you and your closest 3-4 friends learn how to play. I have found only two down sides to this game 1. It literary takes a little over two hours just to get through the rules, but only 45min. to play the actual game. 2. Lots of little pieces to the game to keep track of, which makes for a long set up time. However, having said all that, it is a blast to play. Some luck, but lots of strategy involved."
5,GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!,"I never write reviews but once I played this game, I felt I had to. This game is not only fun but also addictive. It might take a few rounds to get the hang of the game but once you do, you will find yourselves totally immersed in it. I highly recommend this game also for its great educational value. I have not had to think so carefully my strategy since chess. Why does Amazon not sell this game anymore? I do not understand. It does not matter where, just get this game and play it. It will be love at first sight."
2,Not balanced enough,"After playing this game many times, I now realize that some buildings in this game are not balanced. The Hacienda is an example of a building that is too strong, and the observatory (I believe) as a building that is too weak for how expensive it is. The expansion is a good way to introduce some other pieces, and you can use them to balance out the strong pieces. They are available at the manufacturer's website.I also have to say that the learning curve for this game is gargantuan, so don't bother trying to teach other people how to play unless they are very invested and would not mind losing the first time.Apart from that, it is a relatively good game. Lots of pieces, lots of different strategies available to choose among. Enjoy."
4,Great Family Game,"We are a family of four with children aged 10 and 12 and everyone loves Puerto Rico. I rate the instructions as moderately difficult for younger players to comprehend, but easy to master after a practice game or two. The game has enough variety in potential strategies and in gameplay to keep us coming back for more.Puerto Rico is on par with the Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne."
